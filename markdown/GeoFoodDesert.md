# GEO on Food Deserts, Grocery vs Other
Is there a way to use a Places dataset (Google et al) to sort out where food deserts are? 

Could you create a "grocery truck path list?"

What about comparing the relationships between grocery locations, fast food locations, vs convenience store locations. 

How about a "bananna cost analysis" project in conjunction with the food receipt scanning team?

Can we tell the differnce between grocery store "taste" discrimination (theoretically ok)
vs "racial" discrimination location to service poor clients?
