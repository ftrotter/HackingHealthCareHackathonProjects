# GEO on Food Deserts, Grocery vs Other
Is there a way to use a Places dataset (Google et al) to sort out where food deserts are? 

Could you create a "grocery truck path list?"

What about comparing the relationships between grocery locations and attributes (square footage, healthy foods); farmer's markets and green markets locations and frequency; fast food locations; grocery delivery maps (from grocery stores, Amazon, others); convenience store locations.   What about comparing them with community health profiles? [NYC](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-publications/profiles.page) [Houston](http://www.houstontx.gov/health/chs/index.html) [CA](http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/health-profiles/Pages/default.aspx) [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm)

How about an "apple cost analysis" project in conjunction with the food receipt scanning team?

Can we tell the difference between grocery store "taste" discrimination (theoretically ok) vs "racial" discrimination location to service poor clients?
