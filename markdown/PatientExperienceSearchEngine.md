# Patient Experience Search Engine
There are many posts like this one [What is the most ignorant thing you have heard from your doctor](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-ignorant-thing-youve-ever-heard-from-a-medical-doctor)
where patient experience data is "leaking" onto the Internet in a way that can be ethically harvested in a way that does not abuse patient privacy. This happens alot on Reddit and Twitter too.. 

Is there way to use Common Crawler data or perhaps one of the many search API systems to find this and catalog it in a central link site?
