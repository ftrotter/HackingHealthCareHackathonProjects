# Political Term Changes on Govt Websites
Recently, people stopped talking about the Obamacare program called 'Meaningful Use' and instead started saying 'Interoperability'.

Those who are very aware of a particular policy issue might notice these types of changes, but what about policy matters that no one is paying attention to. Is there a way to detect these types of "branding" changes on government websites programatically. 

Another example might be the controversial change to remove certain clinical words (i.e. Fetus) from pdf policy documents.

* The internet archives way back machine has some capapabilites to detect changes like this, but it also might be possible to use their regular API for this: 
* The Internet Archive phrase search

* Stackoverflow article on how that works.
