## Computer Vision on Food Products
Can you use Google Vision (or one of the other super-modern OCR api system) to accept the really hard to read data that we have on food labels, ingredients and nutirtion data?

### Possible Data Sources
There are several datasources that might work for this. 

* Food Graph data (which we can provide in raw form)
* The French Food web dataset
* Amazons Product Database
* HEB has an excellent repo of accessible images
