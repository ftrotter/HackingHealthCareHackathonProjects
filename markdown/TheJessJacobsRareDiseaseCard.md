# The Jess Jacobs Rare Disease Card.
Jess Jacobs was a well-connected e-patient with rare diease that ultimately killed her. 
But while she was alive, she suffered discrimination from a healthcare system that 
could not understand her. Could we have a rare-disease card for people like this?
To help them avoid discrimination and mis-diagnosis when they come to the hospital?
It could be as simple as a youtube video linked to from a QR code on a lamentated
or even better metal-printed card. 
No one is going to question a metal printed card. 
This should be an open protocol project. With no proprietary components that any 
disease community can re-implement with thier codebase...
