# Hospital Events to Meetup Bridge
Many times hospitals and clinics will offer classes to the public, frequently free of charge, in order to educate patients about complicated healthcare issues, or expose them to practical approaches to healthcare issues. Typical courses include

* CPR classes
* Yoga classes
* Lamaz Classes 
* Diabetes Maintence Course

These classes are an under utilized resource. It is not more expensive to run a class of 10 people vs 5. People are simply unaware that these classes exist. 

People search for meetings on meetup.com. Is there a way to create an "meta organization" that "meta-hosts" meetings at healthcare facilities, in order post them on meetup.com? This might make hospitals angry, so watch out.. but I think once they understood how meetup.com worked them might be willing to take over the meeting themselves, which is what you really want... 

## Data Sources
* Writing a web-scraper to get "event data" from hospital websites
* Use Meetup.com api to auto-create meta events?
* IS there another place to show these besides meetup.com?
