# Food Cost Scanner
Receipt data provides valuable information on the variable cost of healthy food. 

They have been notoriously difficult to scan. 

Is it possible to get these to scan using some of the very new "video scanning mechanism". What about traditional feed scanners? Hand Scanners?

Be careful, in our scanning process we would want to remove identifying information

## Data Sources
Go down to HEB and convince 20 peoplt to donate their receipts to food science research. Be careful stores are very sensitive about this information. You could just go buy a few healthty items... This might be something that an austin native could really help us with...

Perhaps you could just go dumpster diving?
