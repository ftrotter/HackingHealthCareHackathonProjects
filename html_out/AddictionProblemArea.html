<h1>Understanding Addiction</h1>
<p>The first thing to understand about addiction is the strict, clinical definition of the word, which is frequently misused. Rather than advocate a specific definition, consider the following definitions, from different expert bodies:</p>
<p><b>Addiction is a complex condition, a brain disease that is manifested by compulsive substance use despite harmful consequence. From the American Psychiatric Association</b> <img width='100px'   src='qrcode_images/5cb5cd8064240d4971057e05b8541ccb.png'></p>
<p><b>Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry. Dysfunction in these circuits leads to characteristic biological, psychological, social and spiritual manifestations. This is reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by substance use and other behaviors. Addiction is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one’s behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and remission. Without treatment or engagement in recovery activities, addiction is progressive and can result in disability or premature death. From the American Society of Addiction Medicine</b> <img width='100px'   src='qrcode_images/62f74167abcb8e8c20854c116459cdaa.png'></p>
<p>In 1964 a World Health Organization Expert Committee introduced the term ‘dependence’ to replace the terms ‘addiction’ and ‘habituation’. Now the define  dependence syndrome as:</p>
<p><b>The Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Health Problems (ICD-10) defines the dependence syndrome as being a cluster of physiological, behavioural, and cognitive phenomena in which the use of a substance or a class of substances takes on a much higher priority for a given individual than other behaviours that once had greater value.</b> <img width='100px'   src='qrcode_images/098760641ade33c9252e80bcb71712ca.png'></p>
<p>Note that the common elements of these definitions are very distinct from the words use in natural language in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>These definitions all imply that addiction is a medical condition with physiological (brain) involvement, rather than a moral failing. </li>
<li>All of these definitions deliniate between a habit or habituation vs an addiction is 'harm'. If you have the habit of picking your nose, that is not an addiction because you are not really harming yourself or others. Similarly, if you would go into opioid withdrawls because you have not recently taken an opioid does not make you a addict. Robbing a pharmacy, because you are having opioid withdrawls or cutting yourself becasue you have opioid withdrawls would count. </li>
</ul>
<p>The 'harm' distinction, between "habituation" and "addiction" is critical and can be counter-intuitative.  It means that mild habits, that always do harm might be addictions, while very profound habituations might not count.  For instance an infrequent cigarette or drinking habit, does slightly increase the risk of diseases like cancer, and as a result, could be argued to be addictions. On the other hand, there are users of heroin, opium and/or legal opioid prescriptions who are regular users who are neither harming themselves or others. They are not addicts under the strict clinical definition. </p>
<p>This is a good first step towards understanding addiction as a disease rather than as a moral failing. This is important because "guilt based therapies", including religious therapies have consistently been shown to be largely ineffective in treating addiction. Twelve Step programs, despite their acceptance in our legal system and hollywood depictions have been frequently shown to be hardly better than no treatment at all. </p>
<p>What has been shown to be the most effective in treating opioid addiction specifically is something called Medication-assisted treatment or MAT for short. Specifically, this involves treating people with opioid habituation with "opioid like" medications that some withdrawl symptoms. The most effective MAT treatment programs are paired with therapy, but do not make therapy a prerequsiste for access to the medications in the program. </p>
