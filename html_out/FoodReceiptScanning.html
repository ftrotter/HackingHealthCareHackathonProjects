<h1>Food Cost Scanner</h1>
<p>Receipt data provides valuable information on the variable cost of healthy food. </p>
<p>They have been notoriously difficult to scan. </p>
<p>Is it possible to get these to scan using some of the very new "video scanning mechanism". What about traditional feed scanners? Hand Scanners?</p>
<p>Be careful, in our scanning process we would want to remove identifying information</p>
<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<p>Go down to HEB and convince 20 peoplt to donate their receipts to food science research. Be careful stores are very sensitive about this information. You could just go buy a few healthty items... This might be something that an austin native could really help us with...</p>
<p>Perhaps you could just go dumpster diving? </p>
