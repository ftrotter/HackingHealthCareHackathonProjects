<h1>One Flight Away College Caregiving</h1>
<p>Parents of children who have disabilities, or medical conditions that sometimes requure emergency support
Frequently need to consider the college search problem from a different angle. 
The need to consider all colleges that are one flight away from the parents home city.
This way, they can have the comfort of knowing that they can quickly fly to the college town for support
Or they can quickly have the child fly back to the parents city for support. 
Realistically, this should be limited to those flights where you can get news of an emergenancy for the majority of the day, but still find a flight to the 
city the same day. (i.e. it is obvious that even tho you can get a direct flight from LA to NY, they are not convenient to reach in the same day, because all of the flights leave before noon. 
Another way to put this challenge. "I want to send my type I diabetic child to a college where if I find out that he has b een hospitalized at 11:30 am, I can be in the hospital with him that night"</p>
