* [Topeka Neighborhood Healthmap](https://data.topeka.org/d/qj26-q4sg) - In 2000, the Planning Department began evaluating the "health" of the city's neighborhoods. This appropriate medical analogy allows you to see if the neighborhood needs "Intensive Care," if it is "At Risk," if it just needs "Out Patient" services, or if it is "Healthy." This overall health rating is based on five indicators of neighborhood health--Poverty, Public Safety, Average Residential Property Value, Homeowner Tenure, and Boarded Houses. These indicators and the methodology have remained the same so the trends throughout the city can be tracked over time. Notes: Block group data displays best when zoomed in to a closer extent.
