On behalf of San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), Corey, Canapary & Galanis (CC&G) undertook a Mode Share Survey within the City and County of San Francisco as well as the eight surrounding Bay Area counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Marin, Santa Clara, Napa, Sonoma and Solano.

The primary goals of this study were to:
• Assess percent mode share for travel in San Francisco for evaluation of the SFMTA Strategic Objective 2.3: Mode Share target of 50% non-private auto travel by FY2018 with a 95% confidence level and MOE +/- 5% or less.
• Evaluate the above statement based on the following parameters:  number of trips to, from, and within San Francisco by Bay Area residents. Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included.
• Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.
• Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.
• Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs.

The survey was conducted as a telephone study among with approximately 750 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, and Cantonese. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample. 
This dataset incorporates respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the “weight” field when appropriate in your analysis. 

The survey period for this survey is as follows:
2012: October 2012 – January 2013
The margin of error is related to sample size (n). For the total sample, the margin of error  is 3.5% for a confidence level of 95%. When looking at subsets of the data, such as just the SF population, just the female population, or just the population of people who bicycle, the sample size decreases and the margin of error increases. Below is a guide of the margin of error for different samples sizes. Be cautious in making conclusions based off of small sample sizes.
 
At the 95% confidence level is:
• n = 767 (Total Sample). Margin of error = +/- 3.5%
• n = 384. Margin of error = +/- 4.95%
• n = 100. Margin of error = +/- 9.80%* [SF Municipal Green Building Inventory](https://data.sfgov.org/d/yuvm-3ujh) - LEED certification is required for all municipal construction projects that are at least 10,000 square feet.

A few questions in TDS 2014 were added after the survey began. In the report, responses that did not answer those questions were excluded from the analysis. The questions that were added late are noted in the TDS 2014 methodology survey instrument.

It is a very, very unlikely scenario that would only occur if no efforts to address SLR occur and both a King Tide and 100-year storm occur at the same time. The real purpose of the maps is to provide a broad net to help the City identify projects that that may be vulnerable. The data is based on what was in the ground as of 2010 and doesn’t include piers. 

The inundation maps and the associated analyses are intended as planning level tools to illustrate the potential for inundation and coastal flooding under a variety of future sea level rise and storm surge scenarios. The maps depict possible future inundation that could occur if nothing is done to adapt or prepare for sea level rise over the next century. The maps do not represent the exact location or depth of flooding. The maps relied on a 1-m digital elevation model created from LiDAR data collected in 2010 and 2011. Although care was taken to capture all relevant topographic features and coastal structures that may impact coastal inundation, it is possible that structures narrower than the 1-m horizontal map scale may not be fully represented. The maps are based on model outputs and do not account for all of the complex and dynamic San Francisco Bay processes or future conditions such as erosion, subsidence, future construction or shoreline protection upgrades, or other changes to San Francisco Bay or the region that may occur in response to sea level rise. For more context about the maps and analyses, including a description of the data and methods used, please see the Climate Stressors and Impacts Report: Bayside Sea Level Rise Inundation Mapping Technical Memorandum, July 2014.

More information at http://onesanfrancisco.org/node/148* [Areas of Vulnerability, 2016](https://data.sfgov.org/d/kc4r-y88d) - These geographic designations were created to define geographic areas within San Francisco that have a higher density of vulnerable populations. These geographic designations will be used for the Health Care Services Master Plan and DPH's Community Health Needs Assessment.

aov_fin - 1 = YES
aov_fin - 0 = NO

AOV's were defined using 2012-2016 ACS data at the census tract level and the following criteria:

1)      Top 1/3rd for < 200% poverty or < 400% poverty & top 1/3rd for persons of color OR
2)      Top 1/3rd for < 200% poverty or < 400% poverty & top 1/3rd for youth or seniors (65+) OR
3)      Top 1/3rd for < 200% poverty or < 400% poverty & top 1/3rd for 2 other categories (unemployment, high school or less, limited English proficiency persons, linguistically isolated households, or disability)

Tracts that had unstable data for an indicator were automatically given zero credit for that indicator. That is why two language variables are included in the bonus group, because there tend to be a high number of tracts with unstable data for language variables.* [Schools](https://data.sfgov.org/d/tpp3-epx2) - Consolidated Infant, Pre-K, and K-14 education points for facilities both public and private.

Point features are intended to be located within a building footprint relevant to each site, so that they can be used to select an appropriate building footprint or parcel as seed for any required buffering.

Buffering may be applied when limiting possible sites for certain businesses or specific individuals, whenever these must remain a minimum distance from school locations.
