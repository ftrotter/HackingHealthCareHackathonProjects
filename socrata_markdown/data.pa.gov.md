* [Newly Identified Confirmed Chronic Hepatitis C Age 15-34 Year 2007-2016 Health](https://data.pa.gov/d/xsm2-kreq) - This data set provides an estimate of the number of people aged 15-34 years with newly identified confirmed chronic (or past/present) hepatitis C infection, by county and by year. The dataset is limited to persons aged 15 to 34 because hepatitis C infection is usually asymptomatic for decades after infection occurs. Cases are usually identified because they have finally become symptomatic, or they were screened. Until very recently, screening for hepatitis C was not routinely performed. This makes it very challenging to identify persons with recent infection. Limiting the age of newly identified patients to 15-34 years makes it more likely that the cases included in the dashboard were infected fairly recently. It is not meant to imply that the opioid crisis’ effect on hepatitis C transmission is limited to younger people. The process by which case counts are determined is as follows: Case reports, which include lab test results and address data, are sent to Pennsylvania’s electronic disease surveillance system (PA-NEDSS). Confirmation status is determined by public health investigators who evaluate test results against the CDC case definition for hepatitis C in place for the year in which the patient was first reported (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/hepatitis-c-chronic/). Reportable disease data, including hepatitis C, is extracted from PA-NEDSS, combined with similar data sent by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH, which uses a separate surveillance system), and sent to CDC. Case data sent to CDC (from PA-NEDSS and PDPH combined) are used to create a statewide reportable disease dataset. This statewide file was used to generate the dashboard dataset. Note that the term that CDC has used to denote persons with hepatitis C infection that is not known to be acute has switched back and forth between “Hepatitis C, past or present” and “Hepatitis C, chronic” over the past several years. The CDC case definition for hepatitis C, chronic (or past or present) changed in 2005, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2016. Persons reported as confirmed in one year may not have been considered confirmed in another year. For example, patients with a positive radioimmunoblot assay (RIBA) or elevated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) signal-to-cutoff level were counted as confirmed in 2012, but not counted as confirmed in 2016. Data sent to CDC’s National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System use a measure for aggregating cases by year called the MMWR year. The MMWR, or the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, is an official publication by CDC and the means by which CDC has historically presented aggregated case count data. Since data in the MMWR are presented by week, the MMWR year always starts on the Sunday closest to Jan 1 and ends on the Saturday closest to Dec 31. The most recent year for which case counts are finalized is 2016. Annual case counts are finalized in May of the following year. The patient zip code, as submitted to PA-NEDSS, is used to determine the case’s county of residence at the time of initial case report. In some instances, the patient zip code is unavailable. In those circumstances, the zip code of the provider that ordered the lab test is used as a proxy for patient zip code. Users should note that the state prison system routinely screens all incoming inmates for hepatitis C. If these inmates are determined to be confirmed cases, they are assigned to the county in which they were incarcerated when their confirmed hepatitis C was first identified. Hepatitis C case counts in counties with state prisons should be interpreted cautiously in light of this enhanced screening activity.

This data was obtained from the Bureau of Special Education (PENNDATA 2016). Intermediate Unit and CTC Part-day enrollments are excluded from county and state totals. Statewide and county totals are unique counts of students being educated by public Local Education Agencies. LEA and School level reports may not sum to the County and Statewide totals. Source: Pennsylvania Information Management System (PIMS) Notes regarding County Totals: Enrollment for School Districts, Charter Schools, State Juvenile Correctional Institutions and Comprehensive CTCs are included. Enrollments for Occupational CTCs and IUs are not included. Counts of students attending education classes on a full-time basis outside their parents' district of residence are included.

* [Sales, Use & Hotel Occupancy Tax Licenses and Certificates Current Revenue](https://data.pa.gov/d/ugeq-ckxd) - This dataset contains the list of sales tax licenses, exemption and wholesaler certificates as maintained by the Department of Revenue (DOR) that are active. For the purposes of this dataset, active status indicates vendors that currently have filing requirements with DOR, as well as valid exemption and wholesaler certificates. This list is intended to be refreshed monthly, removing the licenses that are cancelled or expire without renewal, and adding new licenses once they are approved. The addresses provided are supposed to be the physical location where the taxable sales happen or taxable service provided. The DOR generally does not validate the location address, so there may be misspelled items. Sales, use and hotel occupancy tax licenses must be prominently displayed at the place of business, at each location, photocopies are acceptable. This list also contains exempt organizations that have a current valid exemption number issued by the Department. Exemption numbers must be provided on exemption certificates when purchasing items or services that would be otherwise taxable. For the taxpayer’s convenience, the Department of Revenue allows taxpayers to either report each location’s sales under a unique license number, or consolidate the entire entity’s sales under a single license number. For that reason, you may see some large chains appear to have only one license, where others have multiple licenses. Similarly, you will find licenses/certificates with out of state addresses provided by the applicant. In order to reduce fraud, a portion of the license number / exemption certificate number was masked. If you suspect someone is selling taxable items, providing a taxable service or otherwise not remitting sales tax, use this link to Report Tax Fraud. Tips can be left anonymously, but supporting documentation is helpful. More information about licenses & certificates: PA Code, Article II Sales & Use Tax. PA Department of Revenue website: https://www.revenue.pa.gov. Common questions: •	Why are there out of state/out of country licenses? We allow taxpayers to photocopy licenses, so taxpayers could keep the original license where their records are kept, and post a copy in each PA location. Another reason would be mail order or delivery-based companies. These companies do not maintain a PA address, but could ship to PA or travel into PA to deliver their taxable product or perform their taxable service. •	Does this list contain every volunteer fire company in PA? Only if the volunteer fire company applied for an exemption certificate to purchase items without paying sales tax. An exempt entity that does not hold an exemption certificate could pay the sales tax on the purchase, then file a petition for refund on the tax paid. •	What is a “transient vendor”? In general, someone who temporarily brings taxable items into PA for retail sale, but does not maintain a location. For a more detailed definition, see the PA Code link above. •	What is a “wholesaler certificate”? A wholesale certificate allows sales of otherwise taxable items at the wholesale level; they are not permitted to sell anything at retail. The tax will be collected when the item is sold at retail. Wholesaler certificates are issued primarily to manufacturers and distributors.
* [Overdose Information Network Data Current County State Police](https://data.pa.gov/d/fhqq-ys3f) - This dataset contains summary information on overdose responses and naloxone administrations by Pennsylvania criminal justice agencies and some third-party (i.e. EMS, Fire, Medical Staff, etc) first responders voluntarily entering incident data. Due to the voluntary nature of the application, the ODIN information provided may not represent the totality of all overdose and/or naloxone administration incidents involving criminal justice agencies occurring within the Commonwealth. Although this dataset does include some third-party administrations of naloxone, it should not be used to measure overdose response and naloxone administration incidents among all first responders.
