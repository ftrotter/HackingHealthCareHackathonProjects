* [Windows Replaced - Lead Abatement Program](https://opendata.ramseycounty.us/d/xu2e-aytk) - Saint Paul - Ramsey County Public Health partners with NeighborWorks Home Partners and the East Side Neighborhood Development Company in the Lead Window Replacement Program. Since the programâ€™s start in 1994, 20,000 windows have been replaced in nearly 1,000 homes.
This program assesses lead risks and replaces deteriorated windows in Ramsey County homes that are occupied by young children. Rental properties receive grants for 50 percent of the lead hazard control costs. An average window replacement for a home with 12 windows would cost the property owner $3,000. Owner-occupied properties receive grants for 75 percent of the lead hazard control costs. An average window replacement for a home with 12 windows would cost the property owner $1,500.
