* [Manufactured Homes Survey](https://census.data.commerce.gov/d/krdd-5u5a) - The Manufactured Homes Survey (MHS) provides current monthly estimates of new manufactured (mobile) homes placed for residential use and dealer inventories. Data collected include manufacturer's date of shipment, sales price, date of placement for residential use, placement location (state, county, and community), how titled, and home physical characteristics such as foundation, number of bedrooms, floor area, and air conditioning. The Bureau of Economic Analysis uses the data as an input to estimates of residential fixed investment. The Department of Housing and Urban Development uses the data to monitor total new housing production and its affordability. Trade associations use the data for housing market analysis. Manufacturers and their suppliers use the estimates to monitor trends in prices and characteristics (e.g., floor area, number of bedrooms, presence of central air-conditioning).
* [2006-2010 American Community Survey  5-Year American Indian and Alaska Native Tables](https://census.data.commerce.gov/d/em69-9wjc) - The 2006-2010 ACS 5-Year American Indian and Alaska Native Tables (AIANT) use ACS data aggregated over a 5-year period to provide reliable estimates of detailed social, economic, and housing characteristics for many tribal population groups at multiple levels of geography. Detailed tables on topics such as educational attainment, fertility, nativity, citizenship, income, poverty, and homeownership are iterated for many tribal population groups. For the AIAN, detailed tables are presented for up to 950 population groups in selected geographies such as American Indian and Alaska Native areas where population thresholds were met.
