* [Census 2000 American Indian Area, Alaska Native Area, and Hawaiian Home Land Entity Counts](https://census.data.commerce.gov/d/uc2n-p7ig) - Tallies of American Indian Area, Alaska Native Area, and Hawaiian Home Land entities, by state.
* [Manufactured Homes Survey](https://census.data.commerce.gov/d/krdd-5u5a) - The Manufactured Homes Survey (MHS) provides current monthly estimates of new manufactured (mobile) homes placed for residential use and dealer inventories. Data collected include manufacturer's date of shipment, sales price, date of placement for residential use, placement location (state, county, and community), how titled, and home physical characteristics such as foundation, number of bedrooms, floor area, and air conditioning. The Bureau of Economic Analysis uses the data as an input to estimates of residential fixed investment. The Department of Housing and Urban Development uses the data to monitor total new housing production and its affordability. Trade associations use the data for housing market analysis. Manufacturers and their suppliers use the estimates to monitor trends in prices and characteristics (e.g., floor area, number of bedrooms, presence of central air-conditioning).
