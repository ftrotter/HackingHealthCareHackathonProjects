For dual enrollees, Medicaid may also cover Medicare cost-sharing for acute, primary care, and specialty services covered by Medicare, and other non-LTSS services that are not covered by Medicare. 2. Some comprehensive managed care programs enroll beneficiaries who may be at risk of needing LTSS but do not receive any LTSS. These counts only include individuals that receive LTSS. Moreover, states differ in their ability to report individuals who use MLTSS versus those who are enrolled (and may or may not be using LTSS). This table reports MLTSS users unless otherwise noted. 3. Comprehensive Managed Care Including LTSS does not include PACE programs. 4. MLTSS Only programs cover LTSS under capitation; acute, primary, and specialty care services for these enrollees may be covered by another Medicaid MCO, Medicaid FFS, or by Medicare for dual enrollees. These data include states that provide MLTSS plus other benefits in a package that does not include inpatient medical care. 5. The indicated territory was not able to supply data for this report. The Northern Mariana Islands reported that they have no Medicaid managed care enrollment, but they did not report total Medicaid enrollees.

* [2016 Managed Care Enrollment by Program and Population (Duals)](https://data.medicaid.gov/d/sbzi-6jbm) - The Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Report profiles enrollment statistics on Medicaid managed care programs on a plan-specific level. The managed care enrollment statistics include enrollees receiving comprehensive benefits and limited benefits and are point-in-time counts. 1. Because Medicaid beneficiaries may be enrolled concurrently in more than one type of managed care program (e.g., a Comprehensive MCO and a BHO), users should not sum enrollment across all program types, since the total would count individuals more than once and, in some states, exceed the actual number of Medicaid enrollees. 2. Comprehensive MCOs cover acute, primary, and specialty medical care services; they may also cover behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and other benefits in some states. Limited benefit managed care programs, including MLTSS only, BHO, Dental, Transportation, and Other cover a narrower set of services. 3. The indicated territory was not able to supply data for this report. The Northern Mariana Islands reported that they have no Medicaid managed care enrollment, but they did not report total Medicaid enrollees. "--" indicates states that do not operates programs of a given type. 0 signifies that a state operated a program of this type in 2014, but it ended before July 1, 2014, or began after that date.
