* [Untitled Visualization - Based on Med-QUEST Division Recipients](https://dashboard.hawaii.gov/d/5jhd-hnm2) - The Medical Assistance Program (MEDICAID) has been in effect since January 1966. In August 1994, Hawaii’s Medicaid Program separated into two methods of providing services for the two major groups of recipients. Generally, for individuals who are age 65 and over, or certified blind or disabled, coverage is provided under Hawaii’s Fee-For-Service Medicaid Program where providers are paid directly for their services. For all other individuals, coverage is provided under a managed care program called Hawaii QUEST. Beginning February 2009, individuals who are age 65 and over, or certified blind or disabled are no longer covered under the Fee-For-Service program, medical insurance coverage is provided under a managed care plan call Quest Expanded Access (QExA). Some medical insurance programs such as dental services continue under the Fee-For-Service model.
