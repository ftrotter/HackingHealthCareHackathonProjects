* [Plan ID Crosswalk PUF](https://data.healthcare.gov/d/srri-3w2q) - The Plan ID Crosswalk PUF (CW-PUF) is one of the seven files that make up the Marketplace PUF. The purpose of the CW-PUF is to map QHPs and SADPs offered through the Marketplaces in 2014 to plans that will be offered through the Marketplaces in 2015. These data either originate from the Plan Crosswalk template (i.e., template field), an Excel-based form used by issuers to describe their plans in the QHP application process, or were generated by CCIIO for use in data processing (i.e., system-generated).This data dictionary describes the variables contained in the CW-PUF. Each record relates to a mapping between a plan offered in 2014 and a plan offered in 2015 at the county or county-zip code level.
