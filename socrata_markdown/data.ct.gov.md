Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as “Morphine (not heroin).”  Therefor, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.<br /><br /> “Any Opioid” – If the Medical Examiner cannot conclude whether it’s RX Morphine or heroin based morphine in the toxicity results, that column may be checked* [Care 4 Kids Average Families Served per Month 2011](https://data.ct.gov/d/59q7-vx2z) - Care 4 Kids helps low to moderate income families in Connecticut pay for child care costs.

Commonly reported aggregate attendance measures such as average daily attendance in many instances do not adequately highlight the extent of student absenteeism. This dataset contains aggregate chronic absenteeism rates at the overall district level and by selected student subgroups. Percentages are presented where the cell statistic is representative of 20 students or more; where the cell statistic is representative of fewer than 20 total students the cell is suppressed and an asterisk is displayed. National research1 as well as Connecticut education data2 highlight the association of chronic absenteeism to student academic achievement and high school graduation. Chronic absenteeism is also a key metric in the Department of Education’s school turnaround initiatives (i.e., Alliance Districts and Commissioner’s Network schools).

The Part D Prescriber PUF is based on information from CMS’s Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse, which contains Prescription Drug Event records submitted by Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plans and by stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDP). The dataset identifies providers by their National Provider Identifier (NPI) and the specific prescriptions that were dispensed at their direction, listed by brand name (if applicable) and generic name. For each prescriber and drug, the dataset includes the total number of prescriptions that were dispensed, which include original prescriptions and any refills, and the total drug cost. The total drug cost includes the ingredient cost of the medication, dispensing fees, sales tax, and any applicable administration fees and is based on the amount paid by the Part D plan, Medicare beneficiary, government subsidies, and any other third-party payers.
Although the Part D Prescriber PUF has a wealth of information on payment and utilization for Medicare Part D prescriptions, the dataset has a number of limitations. Of particular importance is the fact that the data may not be representative of a physician’s entire practice or all of Medicare as it only includes information on beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (i.e., approximately two-thirds of all Medicare beneficiaries). In addition, the data are not intended to indicate the quality of care provided. For additional limitations, please review the methodology document in the About tab.* [Home And Community Based Services Rates as of January 1st, 2015](https://data.ct.gov/d/dtti-4mqx) - This data provides a list of home and community-based service providers and their private pay rates for long term care services.* [Accidental Drug Related Deaths by County: 2012-2017](https://data.ct.gov/d/9x7q-pz53) - A listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to June 2017.

Information is also collected on the number of civilian or firefighter casualties and an estimate of property loss.

Participation in NFIRS is voluntary.  

Data is released yearly, with a considerable delay.

Each Incidence is assigned a 3 digit Incidence Type Code.  The code describes the situation emergency personnel found when they arrived.  Incidence Types are grouped into larger categories, called Series.  

For example, Series 400, 'Hazardous Condition' category includes incidence types: 411, 'Gasoline or other flammable liquid spill; 412, 'Gas leak and 413, 'Oil or other combustible liquid spill '.

These figures are broken out by the DCF Region and Office responsible for the child's care, by their Gender, and by whether they had been Reunified within 12 months of their entry to care or not.  It would be appropriate to roll up the data from all variables across multiple time periods, as they represent specific events in the lives of these children.  Please note that these figures do not represent unique children, and so should not be used as the basis for creating a rate based on the child population of the state.  These data form the basis of measurement for the Juan F. Consent Decree Exit Plan Outcome #7: Reunification Within 12 Months, although those figures are reported to the DCF Court Monitor on a quarterly rather than annual schedule.* [Accidental Drug Related Deaths  by Age 2012-2016](https://data.ct.gov/d/s9xn-aujc) - A listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to 2015. A "Y" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected.<br /><br />Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation.<br /><br />The “Morphine (Not Heroin)” values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefor detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin, and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus, in some heroin deaths, the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as “Morphine (not heroin).”  Therefor, the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine, but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.<br /><br /> “Any Opioid” – If the Medical Examiner cannot conclude whether it’s RX Morphine or heroin based morphine in the toxicity results, that column may be checked* [Chronic Absenteeism by District: 2012-13](https://data.ct.gov/d/3bmw-7hhc) - Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing 10 percent or more of the days enrolled in a school year for any reason. Commonly reported aggregate attendance measures such as average daily attendance in many instances do not adequately highlight the extent of student absenteeism. This dataset contains aggregate chronic absenteeism rates at the overall district level and by selected student subgroups. Percentages are presented where the cell statistic is representative of 20 students or more; where the cell statistic is representative of fewer than 20 total students the cell is suppressed and an asterisk is displayed. National research1 as well as Connecticut education data2 highlight the association of chronic absenteeism to student academic achievement and high school graduation. Chronic absenteeism is also a key metric in the Department of Education’s school turnaround initiatives (i.e., Alliance Districts and Commissioner’s Network schools).

Prevalence is included for each disability type as well as overall special education. The overall special education prevalence is calculated by dividing the number of students with disabilities in a district by the total number of students in the district. Prevalence for individual disability types is calculated by dividing the number of students with the specific disability in a district by the total number of students in the district. Note: The category of Other Disability includes disabilities of Hearing Impairment, Visual Impairment, Orthopedic Impairment, Deaf/Blindness, Multiple Disabilities, Traumatic Brain Injury, and Developmental Delay.* [Kindergarten Students with Pre-kindergarten Experience by District: 2009-2012](https://data.ct.gov/d/afba-qnxy) - This dataset contains the percentage of Kindergarten students with Pre-kindergarten experience by district for school years 2009-10 through 2012-13.* [Map of Child Day Care Center & Group Day Care Homes](https://data.ct.gov/d/c46k-b923) - Group day care homes offer or provide a program of supplementary care (A) to not less than seven or more than twelve related or unrelated children on a regular basis, or (B) that meets the definition of a family day care home except that it operates in a facility other than a private family home.

After counting Crime Index offenses reported, minus any unfounded complaints, contributors provide the number of “actual offenses” and the number of crimes cleared. For a criminal offense to be “cleared,” either of the following situations must prevail: (1) at least one person is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for prosecution; or (2) some element beyond police control precludes the physical arrest of the offender (e.g., death of offender, victim refuses to cooperate, confession by offender already in police custody), resulting in the offense being cleared by “exceptional means.” Contributing agencies also include data on the value of property stolen and recovered in connection with the reported offenses, plus specific information regarding homicides, officers assaulted and arson.* [Reunifications by SFY, DCF Office, Race and Length of Stay](https://data.ct.gov/d/9x74-djtb) - This dataset contains aggregate data concerning the number of children that exited DCF care to be Reunified with a parent/guardian from whom they had been removed.  These figures are broken out by the DCF Region and Office responsible for the child's care, by their Age Group, and by whether they had been Reunified within 12 months of their entry to care or not.  It would be appropriate to roll up the data from all variables across multiple time periods, as they represent specific events in the lives of these children.  Please note that these figures do not represent unique children, and so should not be used as the basis for creating a rate based on the child population of the state.  These data form the basis of measurement for the Juan F.
