* [Location of California Licensed Paramedics, Certified EMTs and Certified Advanced EMTs](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/i5vy-iuuh) - Map reflecting the distribution of Paramedics, EMTs and / or Advanced EMTs licensed or certified to work in California based upon the location given for mailing the license or certification. Applicants may supply their work, residential or other location.
* [Insurance Affordability Programs Eligibility Appeals](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/icie-t72e) - This dataset includes the number of individuals who have filed an appeal for a subsidized Covered California Qualified Health Plan (QHP), Medi-Cal, or a combination of both eligibility determinations by year and quarter. Appeals may be filed by an appellant for determinations that resulted in a denial, eligibility, or discontinuance of coverage. A denial is defined as an eligibility determination at application that resulted in a denial of coverage. An appeal regarding an eligibility determination may be filed when the appellant disputes the type of program eligibility. A discontinuance is when an individual is no longer eligible for Medi-Cal or Covered California QHP. Appeals may be filed for cases involving mixed determinations, such as when household members applied for and/or had eligibility determinations made for the two programs (i.e., parents were eligible for Covered California and the child(ren) were eligible for Medi-Cal). Covered California and Medi-Cal eligibility appeals are processed and adjudicated by Administrative Law Judges and the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) staff who track appeals and hearing results. This dataset is part of the public reporting requirements set forth in California Welfare and Institutions Code 14102.5(6).
* [Patient Discharge Data By Principal Procedure](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/g7gr-st2e) - This dataset contains the distribution of inpatient discharges by principal procedure group for each California hospital for years 2009 to most current available year.
* [Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) in Patient Care Areas, 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/6thh-8aa8) - This 2015 central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates file includes four patient care areas: 1) Critical Care Areas (CCAs) are nursing care areas that provide intensive observation, diagnosis, and therapeutic procedures for patients who are critically ill. These areas exclude step-down, intermediate, or telemetry care areas. 2) Neonatal Critical Care (NCC) Areas specialize in Level II/III and/or Level III critical care provided to newborns and infants. 3) General Care Areas (WARDS) include the following types of locations: stepdown general care locations specializing in patients that are hemodynamically stable; medical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of nonsurgical conditions; medical/surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of medical and/or surgical conditions; surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment for pre- or post-surgical conditions; long-term acute care locations specializing in patients requiring an extended stay in an acute care environment; adult rehabilitation general care locations providing care to patients who have lost function; labor, delivery, recovery, postpartum general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of normal and high risk pregnancy patients; behavioral general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients with acute psychiatric or behavioral disorders; jail general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients who are in custody of law enforcement during their treatment; pediatric general care locations providing evaluation or treatment to any patient less than or equal to 18 years of age for any medical or surgical condition; and pediatric rehabilitation locations providing care to patients less than or equal to 18 years of age who have lost function. 4) Special Care Areas (SCA) are nursing care areas which specialize in patients who undergo bone marrow (stem cell) transplant for the treatment of various disorders; or require management and treatment for cancer and/or blood disorders; or require postoperative care after solid organ transplant. This combined CLABSI rates table shows the hospital-specific CLABSI data and central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent by patient care locations in CCAs, NCCs and one treatment area within SCA, "Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care", Permanent and Temporary Central Line Days. The CLABSI measures include the number of CLABSIs, central line-days, patient days, CLABSI rates and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed statistical analyses to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than the California average rates by patient care locations. We know CLABSI rates are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance procedures, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, this data risk adjusted procedure cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may result from less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including the failure to consistently apply all currently accepted standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect the failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or use more aggressive infection surveillance methods that can include the application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the "Licensed Facility Cross-Walk" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.

* [Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) in Critical Care Areas, 2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/rcyj-2xxc) - Critical Care Areas (CCAs) are nursing care areas that provide intensive observation, diagnosis, and therapeutic procedures for patients who are critically ill. These areas exclude step-down, intermediate, or telemetry care areas. This table shows the hospital-specific central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data and central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent by patient care locations in CCAs excluding neonatal critical care. The CLABSI data for each hospital include number of CLABSIs, central line-days and patient days, CLABSI rates and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed statistical analysis to determine whether the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than California average rates by patient care locations. California average rates for 2013 can be found at https://archive.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2013-CLABSI-T1.pdf. CLABSI rates are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, it cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, readers should consider comparisons between two time periods cautiously, as more time is needed to determine if changes will be sustained, and therefore, more meaningful. To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the "Licensed Facility Cross-Walk" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf. Health and Safety Code (HSC) Section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals (GACH) to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CLABSI identified in their facilities. Also, HSC Section 1288.8(b) requires GACHs to report to CDPH in its implementation of infection surveillance and infection prevention process measures including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for central line insertion practices. The data are submitted by California hospitals to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

* [Children Receiving Child Health Disability Prevention (CHDP) Services by Funding Source, Fiscal Year 2011-12](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/a4i2-rfva) - This chart represents children receiving Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) services by funding source. It is based on the annual report for state fiscal year (SFY) 2011-12 which provides an aggregate level data drawn from the Confidential Screening/Billing Report (PM-160) form used for fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement of services, and/or for reporting preventive health assessment services. The display of the data in this report is intended to provide a detailed view of the health assessments provided to CHDP eligible children and youth as reported to the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) during SFY 2011-12. CHDP eligible children and youth are those whose gross family incomes are at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, age restriction for full-scope Medi-Cal of less than 21 years of age, presumptive eligibility (the Gateway process), or children and youth with no health insurance for health assessments who must be less than 19 years of age. CHDP children and youth receive health assessment services according to the age-based CHDP Periodicity Schedule or when assessments are considered medically necessary.
* [Disaster Healthcare Volunteers (DHV)](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/5zu8-di9s) - Disaster Healthcare Volunteers (DHV) is a program that registers and credentials health professionals who may wish to volunteer during disaster including doctors, nurses, paramedics, pharmacists, dentists, mental health practitioners, etc. DHV may be used by local officials to support a variety of local needs, including augmenting medical staff at healthcare facilities or supporting mass vaccination clinics. DHV is California’s Emergency System for the Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals (ESAR-VHP). This dataset list volunteers by thieir based organizations.
* [Asthma Prevalence, Adults (18 and older) by Year,  2012 to 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/y6an-nzqq) - This dataset contains the estimated percent of California adults (18 and older) with lifetime and current asthma (asthma prevalence), by year. The data are derived from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). These data are based on self-report from telephone surveys and are subject to bias and low response rates. In 2012, the survey methodology of the BRFS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey included both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the survey, and 3) new methods were used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 – 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond. CDPH and CDC recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time. Please refer to the attachment for AsthmaPrevalence-Adults-by-Year-CA-Description.pdf.

* [Adolescent Births 2010-2012](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/f254-kjq2) - http://tinyurl.com/AdolescentBirthRatesMap, http://tinyurl.com/PercentOfRepeatBirthsMap, http://tinyurl.com/PercentOfBirthsInHighPoverty. This dataset contains three indicators concerning births among adolescents aged 15-19: (1) Adolescent Birth Rate (ABR); (2) Percentage of Repeat Birth (PRB); and (3) Percentage of Births in High Poverty Area (PBHP).Early childbearing is an important public health issue that can be addressed by monitoring surveillance data such as adolescent birth rates (ABR) and percentage of repeat births (PRB). These data, particularly across small areas such as Medical Service Areas, are a valuable part of surveillance that informs program planning efforts targeting localized needs. These three indicators (ABR, PRB, PBHP) are stratified by adolescent mothers' race and Hispanic ethnicity. The race and Hispanic ethnic groups in this table utilize four mutually exclusive race and ethnicity categories. These categories are Hispanic (HISP) and the following Non-Hispanic categories of Black, Asian, and White. Data should not be compared to previous data where birth rates were presented by Medical Service Study Area due to differences in methodology and population data sources. A link to the full report about these current data can be found here https://archive.cdph.ca.gov/data/statistics/Pages/AdolescentHealthData.aspx
* [Emergency Department Visits - Disposition to Hospice Care and Residential Care Facilities in Riverside County](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/aubc-pps9) - Chart contains the emergency department encounters and admits for Hospice Care and Residential Facility Care for all Riverside County hospitals for 2010-2015.
* [Percent of Residents with Access to High Quality Public Transit, San Francisco Bay Area Region and Southern California Region by Race/Ethnicity, 2012](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/8qf8-3fk9) - This table contains data on the percent of population residing within ½ mile of a major transit stop for four California regions and the counties, cities/towns, and census tracts within the regions. The percent was calculated using data from four metropolitan planning organizations (San Diego Association of Governments, Southern California Association of Governments, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Sacramento Council of Governments) and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. A strong and sustainable transportation system supports safe, reliable, and affordable transportation opportunities for walking, bicycling, and public transit, and helps reduce health inequities by providing more opportunities for access to healthy food, jobs, health care, education, and other essential services. Active and public transportation promote health by enabling individuals to increase their level of physical activity, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease and obesity, improving mental health, and lowering blood pressure. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.
* [Esophageal Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings for California Hospitals, Map](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/rsev-rp4e) - This map contains the location of hospitals that treated patients with esophageal resection. The 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 5.0, while the 2013 and 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 4.5. The differences in the statistical method employed and inclusion and exclusion criteria using different versions can lead to different results. Users should not compare trends of mortality rates over time. However, many hospitals showed consistent performance over years; “better” performing hospitals may perform better and “worse” performing hospitals may perform worse consistently across years. It also provides risk-adjusted inpatient mortality rates, quality ratings, and number of deaths and cases. This data does not include conditions treated or procedures performed in outpatient settings. Please refer to statewide table for California overall rates.
* [Percent of Residents Biking to Work by Race/Ethnicity, Population 16 Years of Age or Older, California, 2006-2010](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/rkd9-p5hz) - This table contains data on the percent of residents aged 16 years and older mode of transportation to work for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx). Commute trips to work represent 19% of travel miles in the United States. The predominant mode – the automobile - offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Automobile commuting has been linked to stress-related health problems. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression. Risk of injury and death in collisions are higher in urban areas with more concentrated vehicle and pedestrian activity. Bus and rail passengers have a lower risk of injury in collisions than motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience four times the death rate Whites or Asian pedestrians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.
* [Newborn Screened Diseases by Race/Ethnicity, 2009-2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/m9a6-waij) - This table presents the disorders diagnosed by the California Newborn Screening Program during the five-year period from 2009 through 2015. The counts of disorders are presented by race/ethnicity groups. The disorders included are part of the core recommended panel (RUSP) put forth by the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) established under the Section 1111 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, 42 U.S.C. 300b-10, as amended in the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008. The Committee recommends that every state newborn screening program include a uniform screening panel that currently includes 31 core disorders; the Genetic Disease Screening program screens for all of the core conditions excluding newborn hearing loss screening and critical congenital heart disease screening which are programs administered by the Department of Health Care Services. If individual disorder counts were <6, the disorders were combined into a group called "Other rare disorders", as described in the attached Data Dictionary. In addition, race/ethnic groups were combined into larger categories if individual group denominator was less than 20,000 newborns screened during the six year period from 2009-2015. Three types of sickle cell-related hemoglobinopathies (Sickle Beta+ Thalassemia, Sickle S/S Disease and Sickle S/C Disease) were combined into one group called "Sickle Cell Disease".

This dataset does not include ischemic stroke treated in outpatient settings.
* [Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) in Patient Care Areas, 2014](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/jffr-pwkr) - This 2014 central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates file includes four patient care areas: 1) Critical Care Areas (CCAs) are nursing care areas that provide intensive observation, diagnosis, and therapeutic procedures for patients who are critically ill. These areas exclude step-down, intermediate, or telemetry care areas. 2) Neonatal Critical Care (NCC) Areas specialize in Level II/III and/or Level III critical care provided to newborns and infants. 3) General Care Areas (WARDS) include the following types of locations: stepdown general care locations specializing in patients that are hemodynamically stable; medical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of nonsurgical conditions; medical/surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of medical and/or surgical conditions; surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment for pre- or post-surgical conditions; long-term acute care locations specializing in patients requiring an extended stay in an acute care environment; adult rehabilitation general care locations providing care to patients who have lost function; labor, delivery, recovery, postpartum general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of normal and high risk pregnancy patients; behavioral general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients with acute psychiatric or behavioral disorders; jail general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients who are in custody of law enforcement during their treatment; and pediatric general care locations providing evaluation or treatment to any patient less than or equal to 18 years of age for any medical or surgical condition. 4) Special Care Areas (SCA) are nursing care areas which specialize in patients who undergo bone marrow (stem cell) transplant for the treatment of various disorders; or require management and treatment for cancer and/or blood disorders; or require postoperative care after solid organ transplant. Starting with this 2014 SCA file, six treatment locations were added: "Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care", Permanent and Temporary Central Line Days, "Oncology - General Hematology/Oncology Ward", Permanent and Temporary Central Line Days, and "Oncology Solid Tumor Ward", Permanent and Temporary Central Line Days. This combined CLABSI rates table shows the hospital-specific CLABSI data and central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent by patient care locations in CCAs, NCCs and one new treatment area within SCA, "Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care", Permanent and Central Line Days. The CLABSI measures include the number of CLABSIs, central line-days, patient days, CLABSI rates and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed statistical analyses to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than the California average rates by patient care locations. We know CLABSI rates are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance procedures, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, this data risk adjusted procedure cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may result from less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including the failure to consistently apply all currently accepted standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect the failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or use more aggressive infection surveillance methods that can include the application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, readers should understand the limitations of results based on the analysis of only two time periods, s
* [Educational Attainment, 2000-2010](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/kka6-zy7x) - This table contains data on the percent of residents aged 25 years and older educational attainment (percent completing high school, associates degree, college or more advanced degree) for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.
* [Patient Discharge Data by Race Groups](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/q5ki-89hr) - This dataset contains the distribution of inpatient discharges by race group for each California hospital, 2009 - 2015.

* [Preterm and Very Preterm Births by Race/Ethnicity 2010-2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/fju5-uks4) - This dataset contains percent preterm and very preterm live births by race/ethnic group of mother. Preterm births are all live births less than 37 weeks of gestation. Very preterm births are all live births less than 32 weeks of gestation. Important growth and development occur throughout pregnancy, especially in the final months and weeks. There is a higher risk of serious disability or death the earlier a baby is born. Gestational age is based on obstetric estimate at delivery (OE). Data includes births with gestational age of 17-47 weeks. Data should not be compared to other data where gestational age is based on the date of last normal menses (LMP) and not OE. The National Center for Health Statistics recently transitioned to using an OE-based gestational age measure due to increasing evidence of its greater validity compared with the LMP-based measure. (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_05.pdf) Note: The race and ethnic groups in this table utilize eight mutually exclusive race and ethnicity categories. These categories are Hispanic and the following Non-Hispanic categories of Multi-Race, African-American, American Indian (includes Eskimo and Aleut), Asian, Pacific Islander (includes Hawaiian), White (includes Other race) and Unknown (includes refused to state and missing).
* [Licensed Bed Classification and Designations Trends](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/rsr5-a4zw) - This dataset contains information by licensed facility including number of patient days, hospital discharges, licensed bed days, and intra-hospital transfer from critical care by the six licensed bed classifications, including General Acute Care, Chemical Dependency Recovery, Acute Psychiatric, Skilled Nursing, Intermediate Care, and Intermediate Care/Developmentally Disabled. The General Acute Care classification is further defined by bed designation categories that include Medical/Surgical (includes GYN/DOU), Perinatal (includes LDRP, excludes nursery), Pediatric Acute, Intensive Care, Coronary Care, Acute Respiratory Care, Burn Center, Intensive Care Newborn Nursery, and Rehabilitation Center bed designations. 2015 data are preliminary, are as reported and have not been audited.

* [Independent Medical Review (IMR) Determinations, Trend, Rich List View](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/cxm9-7xqh) - This data is from the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC). It contains all decisions from Independent Medical Reviews (IMR) administered by the DMHC since January 1, 2001. An IMR is an independent review of a denied, delayed, or modified health care service that the health plan has determined to be not medically necessary, experimental/investigational or non-emergent/urgent. If the IMR is decided in an enrollees favor, the health plan must authorize the service or treatment requested.
* [Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Bloodstream Infections in Hospitals, 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/9ehe-5yvg) - This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) standardized infection ratios (SIR) of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream Infections (MRSA BSI) reported by California general acute care hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care hospitals. The HO MRSA BSI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of MRSA BSI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2015 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent MRSA BSI rate data. MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when the first positive blood test is obtained after the third day of hospitalization. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO MRSA BSI incidence include hospital bed size, affiliation with a medical school, and the community burden of MRSA BSI as observed in patients admitted to the hospital. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO MRSA BSI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring MRSA BSI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO MRSA BSI predicted less than one if the number of HO MRSA BSI predicted was ≥ 0.2. For each hospital with a MRSA BSI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s MRSA BSI SIR as indicating: • No Different - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, • Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or • Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted. To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the "Licensed Facility Cross-Walk" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf. Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of MRSA BSI identified in their facilities associated with inpatient treatment. The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). For more information on data collection processes and methods, please see the "MRSA and VRE BSI Technical Notes" of the healthcare-associated infections (HAI) report on: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/HAIProgramHome.aspx. The SIRs cannot be compared across hospitals because of "indirect" standardization methodology used in calculating the SIRs.
* [Statewide Trend in Rate of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Procedures (Age 40+), 2005-2014](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/i2e9-wvbb) - This chart displays the Statewide trend in the overall rate of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Procedures (Age 40+). It is based upon the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s (AHRQ’s) Inpatient Quality Indicator #26.
* [Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) in Neonatal Critical Care, 2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/45uw-tk7y) - Neonatal Critical Care (NCC) Areas specialize in Level II/III and/or Level III critical care provided to newborns and infants. This table shows the hospital-specific central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data and central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent by patient care locations in Neonatal Critical Care Areas. The CLABSI data for each hospital neonatal care location include number of CLABSIs, central line-days and patient days, CLABSI rates per 1000 line days and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed statistical analysis to determine whether the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than California average rates. California average rates for 2013 can be found at https://archive.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2013-CLABSI-T1.pdf. CLABSI rates are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, it cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, readers should consider comparisons between two time periods cautiously, as more time is needed to determine if changes will be sustained, and therefore, more meaningful.

Health and Safety Code (HSC) Section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals (GACH) to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CLABSI identified in their facilities. Also, HSC Section 1288.8(b) requires GACHs to report to CDPH in its implementation of infection surveillance and infection prevention process measures including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for central line insertion practices. The data are submitted by California hospitals to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

* [Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) for 24 Operative Procedures, 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/gikw-2be4) - This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) risk adjusted Standardized infection ratios (SIR) for surgical site infections (SSIs) reported by a hospital for 24 Operative procedures that are listed in the Data Dictionary. The SIR is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period 2006 through 2008, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience. The SIR calculated only if the number of observed is at least one, to enforce a minimum precision criterion and these SIRs are based on the date of procedure, not the date of event. All procedure and infection data entered before May 3, 2016 for surgical procedures performed between January 1 and December 31, 2015 were downloaded from NHSN for this data release. The SIR used for this table is risk adjusted SIR that considers only complex SSI identified during hospital Admission or Readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries and hereafter referred to as SIR. A SIR was calculated by CDPH, if the predicted number of infections was less than 1 and greater than or equal 0.2. This SIR and its comparison are not as accurate as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections. For a detailed explanation, please see the Technical Notes. The hospital submitted procedure counts and infection counts are displayed along with an SIR and, the 95 percent confidence interval for the SIR and the statistical comparison as follow: * No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections • Higher - more infections than predicted, or • Lower - fewer infections than predicted To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the "Licensed Facility Cross-Walk" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.

* [Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) in Special Care Areas, 2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/uh97-6en2) - Special Care Areas (SCA) are nursing care areas which specialize in patients who undergo bone marrow (stem cell) transplant for the treatment of various disorders; or require management and treatment for cancer and/or blood disorders; or require postoperative care after solid organ transplant. This table shows the hospital-specific central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data by patient care locations in Special Care Areas. The CLABSI data for each hospital patient care location include number of CLABSIs, central line-days and patient days, CLABSI rates per 1000 line days and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed a statistical analysis to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than California average rates. California average rates for 2013 can be found at https://archive.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2013-CLABSI-T1.pdf.

Within DHCS, the Substance Use Disorder Compliance (SUDC) Division Licensing and Certification Branch (LCB) is responsible for assuring that quality services are provided to all program participants in a safe and healthful environment through the licensure, certification, regulation, and oversight of a statewide system of alcohol and other drug recovery and treatment facilities and programs and counselors.
* [Eligibility Actions Appealed by Quarter and Program for Insurance Affordability Programs](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/hjp8-qpzh) - This chart displays the number of individuals who have filed an appeal for a subsidized Covered California Qualified Health Plan (QHP), Medi-Cal, or a combination of both eligibility determinations by Program and Quarter for the year 2016 . Appeals may be filed by an appellant for determinations that resulted in a denial, eligibility, or discontinuance of coverage. A denial is defined as an eligibility determination at application that resulted in a denial of coverage. An appeal regarding an eligibility determination may be filed when the appellant disputes the type of program eligibility. A discontinuance is when an individual is no longer eligible for Medi-Cal or Covered California QHP. Appeals may be filed for cases involving mixed determinations, such as when household members applied for and/or had eligibility determinations made for the two programs (i.e., parents were eligible for Covered California and the child(ren) were eligible for Medi-Cal). Covered California and Medi-Cal eligibility appeals are processed and adjudicated by Administrative Law Judges and the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) staff who track appeals and hearing results. This dataset is part of the public reporting requirements set forth in California Welfare and Institutions Code 14102.5(6).

* [Adults Meeting Physical Activity Guidelines (LGHC Indicator 16)](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/p5by-xzcb) - This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/. This table displays the percentage of adults meeting Aerobic Physical Activity guidelines in California. It contains data for California only. The data are from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). The California BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional health-related telephone survey that collects data about California residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. The BRFSS is conducted by the Public Health Survey Research Program of California State University, Sacramento under contract from CDPH. The column percentages are weighted to the 2010 California Department of Finance (DOF) population statistics. Population estimates were obtained from the CA DOF for age, race/ethnicity, and sex. Values may therefore differ from what has been published in the national BRFSS data tables by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other federal agencies.
