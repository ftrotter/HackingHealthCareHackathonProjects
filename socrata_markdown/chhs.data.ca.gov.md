DSH is a special program which is aimed at making up the short-fall for hospitals when care is provided to an uninsured or underinsured patient and to Medi-Cal beneficiaries.  A hospital which provides a certain amount of uncompensated care is designated as a disproportionate share hospital.* [List of Public Subsidized Housing (PSH) Locations Enrolled in the Assisted Living Waiver (ALW) Program](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/bzbi-kiwe) - Participants in the ALW program have access to Public Subsidized Housing. ALW services are provided to waiver participants by licensed Home Health Agencies enrolled as ALW providers. Residents in public subsidized housing may or may not be Medi-Cal members. This dataset displays the names, location and contact information for the Home Health Agency associated with the ALW approved PSH.* [Clostridium Difficile Infections (CDI) in Rehabilitation Facilities, 2014](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/bq9x-mx6f) - Rehabilitation hospitals are hospitals with inpatient wards for evaluation and restoration of function to patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. These hospitals were self-identified through National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported by California rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  The hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Differences in rates for rehabilitation acute care hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in rehabilitation acute care hospitals is provided separately from the rates in long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals.  Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI.  Also, specifically for LTAC and rehabilitation acute care hospitals, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI.  In this table, hospital rates of CDI for rehabilitation acute care hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable.

Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CDI identified in their facilities.  The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). For more information on data collection processes and methods, please see the "CDI Technical Notes" of the healthcare-associated infections (HAI) report at: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/HAIProgramHome.aspx. Differences in rates for LTAC and rehabilitation hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. Rates from rehabilitation hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable, as there can be as much as a two-fold difference in test sensitivity. Therefore, the rehabilitation hospital-specific rates presented here have not been risk adjusted and are not comparable.* [Clostridium Difficile Infections (CDI) in Long-Term Acute Care, 2014](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/22bc-3geb) - Long-term acute care is a hospital defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as a licensed general acute care hospital providing care for patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay for all patients of greater than 25 days. This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported by California long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals.  The hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Differences in rates for LTAC hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in LTAC hospitals is provided separately from the rates in rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI.  Also, specifically for LTAC and rehabilitation acute care hospitals, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI.  In this table, hospital rates of CDI for LTAC hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable.

RHB receives multiple requests for current listings of technologists via the Public Request Act. The data is collected via an internal database named Health Applications Licensing where all license applications and renewal information is stored and tracked. This data hopes to provide informational data for the public to utilize. The benefit of using this table is to provide the public a list of technologists in the State of California. The list will also assist scholars working on research projects who are seeking to compile a national database. This data table is an attempt to give the public a list of all active technologists in the State of California. The data is collected via an internal database named Health Applications Licencing where all license applications and renewal information is stored and tracked. Limitations include out of date listings since the field of technologist is rapidly increasing, an accurate list would need to be posted more frequently.* [Emergency Department Data By Race Group](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/fh6i-f35a) - :  This dataset contains the emergency department encounters and admits by race group for California hospitals for years 2010-2014.* [Seismic Ratings and Collapse Probabilities of California Hospitals](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/3c5y-eq7m) - This dataset lists the Structural Performance Category or “SPC rating” and Nonstructural Performance Category or “NPC rating” of all General Acute Care Hospitals in California, including a building’s probability of collapse in a significant earthquake is assessed using Multi-Hazard Loss Estimation Technology (HAZUS).* [Case Mix Index-1996-2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/5pvx-hnf7) - The Case Mix Index (CMI) is the average relative DRG weight of a hospital’s inpatient discharges, calculated by summing the Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) weight for each discharge and dividing the total by the number of discharges.  The CMI reflects the diversity, clinical complexity, and resource needs of all the patients in the hospital.  A higher CMI indicates a more complex and resource-intensive case load.  Although the MS-DRG weights, provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), were designed for the Medicare population, they are applied here to all discharges regardless of payer.  Note: It is not meaningful to add the CMI values together.* [Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) - Census Detail](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/dmib-h3d5) - This dataset contains the Medical Service Study Areas (MSSA), at the census tract level, designated as Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas in California.* [Clostridium Difficile Infections (CDI) in Rehabilitation Facilities, 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/icjv-yetg) - Rehabilitation hospitals are hospitals with inpatient wards for evaluation and restoration of function to patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. These hospitals were self-identified through National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported by California free-standing rehabilitation acute care hospitals and rehabilitation units with their own Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certification number (CCN).  The hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Differences in rates for rehabilitation acute care hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in rehabilitation acute care hospitals is provided separately from the rates in long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals.

Some CWP Objectives do not have program leads, data sources, baselines, and/or targets, but are included because they were a result of CDPH program or partner input and were felt to be important to the reduction of chronic disease incidence, prevalence, and health disparities. Agencies, programs and/or partners identified with an objective may be either data stewards and/or engaged in activities to achieve the target, but may not have adequate resources for statewide activities.  Developmental Objectives will be updated as information becomes available. 

Background: The California Wellness Plan, California's Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Plan was released February 2014 by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).  The overarching goal of CWP is Equity in Health and Wellbeing; additional CWP Goals include: 1) Healthy Communities, 2) Optimal Health Systems Linked with Community Prevention, 3) Accessible and Usable Health Information, and 4) Prevention  Sustainability and Capacity. All CWP objectives fall under the framework of Let's Get Healthy California Task Force priorities.

These hospitals were self-identified through National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported by California rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  The hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Differences in rates for rehabilitation acute care hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in rehabilitation acute care hospitals is provided separately from the rates in long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals.  Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI.  Also, specifically for LTAC and rehabilitation acute care hospitals, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI.  In this table, hospital rates of CDI for rehabilitation acute care hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable.

Standardized Infection Ratios (SIR) adjusted for patient care locations for hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care. The CLABSI data for each hospital include number of observed (reported) CLABSIs, number of predicted CLABSIs (based on the national baseline data), number of central line-days, CLABSI SIRs and their 95% confidence intervals, and the statistical interpretation as follows:
•    No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections
•    High - more infections than predicted, or
•    Low - fewer infections than predicted
CLABSI SIRs are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance. While CLABSI SIRs are adjusted for patient care locations, they cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI SIRs. A low CLABSI SIR may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high SIR may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, SIRs cannot be compared across hospitals because of the "indirect" standardization methodology used in calculating the SIRs. To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the "Licensed Facility Cross-Walk" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.

Health and Safety Code (HSC)  Section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals (GACH) to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CLABSI identified in their facilities.  Also, HSC Section 1288.8(b) requires GACHs to report to CDPH in its implementation of infection surveillance and infection prevention process measures including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for central line insertion practices. The data are submitted by California hospitals to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

Users should exercise caution when comparing trends of rates over time (see metadata for more information).* [Rates of Preventable Hospitalizations for Selected Medical Conditions by County](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/g7zj-u282) - (See Note below regarding 2015 data). The dataset contains hospitalization counts and rates, statewide and by county, for 13 ambulatory care sensitive conditions plus 3 composite measures.  Hospitalizations due to these medical conditions are potentially preventable through access to high-quality outpatient care.  The conditions include: diabetes short-term complications; perforated appendix; diabetes long-term complications; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma in older adults (age 40 and over); hypertension; heart failure; dehydration; bacterial pneumonia; urinary tract infection; angina without procedure; uncontrolled diabetes; asthma in younger adults (age 18-39); and lower-extremity amputation among patients with diabetes.  The data provides a good starting point for assessing quality of health services in the community.  The data does not measure hospital quality.  Note: OSHPD is only releasing the first 3 quarters of 2015 data due to a change in the reporting of diagnoses/procedures from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS effective October 1, 2015, and the inability of the AHRQ software to handle both code sets concurrently.* [Patient Discharge Data by Gender](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/eznt-825e) - This chart displays the statewide distribution of inpatient discharges by gender for California hospitals, 2009 - 2015.* [GI Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings for California Hospitals, Map](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/s3r3-n2ve) - This map contains the location of hospitals that treated patients with Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage.

The Electronic Licensing Management System (ELMS) is a California Department of Public Health data system created to manage state licensing-related data.   This file lists California healthcare facilities that are operational and have a current license issued by the CDPH and/or a current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification. The L&C Open Data facility file is geo-coded and updated quarterly. To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the "Licensed Facility Cross-Walk" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.  Facility geographic variables are updated quarterly, if latitude/longitude information is missing at any point in time, it should be available when the next time the Open Data facility file is refreshed.* [Clostridium Difficile Infections (CDI) in Hospitals, 2014](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/xkjr-eri4) - This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) standardized infection ratios (SIR) of hospital onset (HO) Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) reported by  California general acute care hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  The HO CDI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of CDI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2014 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent CDI rate data.  CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO CDI incidence include the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital.  Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. Hospitals with NHSN-predicted number of HO CDI cases <1 had no SIRs calculated by NHSN due to less precise comparisons.   For each hospital with a CDI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number.  Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s CDI SIR as indicating: 
• No Different - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, 
• Higher - higher or more infections than predicted, or 
• Lower - lower or fewer infections than predicted.

The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). For more information on data collection processes and methods, please see the "CDI Technical Notes" of the healthcare-associated infections (HAI) report at: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/HAIProgramHome.aspx  The SIRs cannot be compared across hospitals because of "indirect" standardization methodology used in calculating the SIRs.* [Patient Discharge Data By Disposition](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/grsd-atkb) - This dataset contains the distribution of inpatient discharges by disposition for each California hospital for years 2009-to current available year.* [Hospital Emergency Department Services Utilization Trends Overview, 2011-2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/8226-sbg3) - The dataset includes hospital Emergency Department Service (EMS) Level, Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA) Trauma Center Designation Level, EMS treatment stations, ambulance diversion hours, and total EMS visits for all licensed, comparable hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals in California.* [Unemployment 2004-2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/u729-zehn) - This table contains data on the percent of the population in the labor force who are unemployed (unemployment rate), for California, its regions, counties, county divisions, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the  U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS). The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx). Unemployment is associated with higher rates of self-reported poor health, long-term illnesses, higher incidence of risky health behaviors (alcoholism, smoking), and increased mortality. Various explanations have been proposed for the link between poor health and unemployment; for example, economic deprivation that results in reduced access to essential goods and services.  Another explanation is that unemployment causes the loss of latent functions (social contact, social status, time structure and personal identity) which can result in stigma, isolation and loss of self-worth. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.* [Patient Discharge Data by Discharge Days](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/seyh-wc35) - This dataset contains the number of inpatient discharge days for each California hospital, 2009 - 2015.* [Adults with Diabetes Per 100 (LGHC Indicator 23)](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/wxuj-5sr7) - This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at "https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/. This table displays the prevalence of diabetes in California. It contains data for California only. The data are from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). The California BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional health-related telephone survey that collects data about California residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.  The BRFSS is conducted by Sacramento State under contract from CDPH. This prevalence rate does not include pre-diabetes, or gestational diabetes. This is based on the question: "Has a doctor, or nurse or other health professional ever told you that you have diabetes?" The sample size for 2014 was 8,832. NOTE: Denominator data and weighting was taken from the California Department of Finance, not U.S. Census. Values may therefore differ from what has been published in the national BRFSS data tables by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other federal agencies.* [Smoking Prevalence in Adults](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/r3x3-5ydr) - Adult smoking prevalence in California, males and females aged 18+, starting in 1984 from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Current cigarette smoking is defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and now smoking every day or some days. Caution must be used when comparing the percentages of smokers over time as the definition of ‘current smoker’ was broadened in 1996 and the survey methods were changed in 2012. Prior to 1996, the definition of current cigarettes smoking was having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and smoking now. Due to the methodology change in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time.* [Location, Age and Experience of Paramedics and EMTs Licensed in California](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/f4as-car4) - This table contains the location, age group, years of experience, and certifying entity for each actively licensed paramedic and certified emergency medical technician (EMT) including advanced EMTs in the state of California.

Compiled from U.S. Census, 2000 U.S. Census Summary File.* [Respondents Indicating At Least 1 Type of Adverse Childhood Experience (LGHC Indicator 04)](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/68hs-dfix) - This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/. The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) module of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) asks respondents questions about eight different traumatic childhood experiences that occurred before the age of 18. These include verbal/emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and negative household situations including the incarceration of an adult, alcohol or drug abuse by an adult, violence between adults, mental illness of a household member, and parental divorce or separation. A cumulative ACEs score is calculated for each respondent by counting the number of these items that a respondent reported experiencing, creating a score ranging from 0 to 8.
11 questions about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are condensed into a ordinal scale from 0 to 8 possible ACEs. This indicator shows the prevalence of adults who reported having 1 or more ACEs. However other data cuts are available, e.g., 3 or more ACEs The ACEs module is a very "lagging" indicator capturing childhood experiences retrospectively by asking adults 18+ years of age.  Additional limitations include: 1) relies on self-reported information, 2) provides prevalence, not incidence data, 3) bias or measurement error associated with telephone-administered survey of a sample of the population (e.g., response bias, sampling variation), 4) designed to provide state-level population health estimates and does not provide sub-state estimates or estimates by racial sub-groups (e.g., Asian sub-groups) unless multiple years are combined. Because of the changes in the methodology, researchers are advised to avoid comparing data collected before the changes (up to 2010) with data collected from 2011 and onward: http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2013/pdf/compare_2013.pdf. In addition, due to changes in the insurance variables, the "Other Public" insurance category was not able to be calculated in 2013.* [Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Bloodstream Infections in Long-Term Acute Care, 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/vk8z-ujw2) - Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs) are defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days. This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA BSI) reported by  California LTACs to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), during the time period January through December 2015. MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for LTACs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted LTAC MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by LTAC hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within this group should still be made with caution.

This dataset list volunteers by thieir based organizations.* [Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Bloodstream Infections in Rehab Facilities, 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/byzv-4q6g) - Rehabilitation acute hospitals are hospitals with inpatient wards for evaluation and restoration of function to patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. These hospitals were self-identified through National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA BSI) reported by California free-standing rehabilitation acute care hospitals and rehabilitation units with their own Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certification number (CCN).  MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for REHABs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted REHAB MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within REHABs should still be made with caution. That is, differences in rates within this hospital type can represent other factors besides differences in infection and transmission prevention practices.

It contains all decisions from Independent Medical Reviews (IMR) administered by the DMHC since January 1, 2001. An IMR is an independent review of a denied, delayed, or modified health care service that the health plan has determined to be not medically necessary, experimental/investigational or non-emergent/urgent. If the IMR is decided in an enrollees favor, the health plan must authorize the service or treatment requested.* [Housing Cost Burden, 2006-2010](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/37cg-vrvn) - This table contains data on the percent of households paying more than 30% (or 50%) of monthly household income towards housing costs for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts.  Data is from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Consolidated Planning Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) and the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS). The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Affordable, quality housing is central to health, conferring protection from the environment and supporting family life. Housing costs—typically the largest, single expense in a family's budget—also impact decisions that affect health. As housing consumes larger proportions of household income, families have less income for nutrition, health care, transportation, education, etc.  Severe cost burdens may induce poverty—which is associated with developmental and behavioral problems in children and accelerated cognitive and physical decline in adults.  Low-income families and minority communities are disproportionately affected by the lack of affordable, quality housing.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Attachments.* [Hemorrhagic Stroke Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings for California Hospitals, Map](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/pvwx-bb7m) - This map contains the location of hospitals that treated patients with hemorrhagic stroke.

Some CWP Objectives do not have program leads, data sources, baselines, and/or targets, but are included because they were a result of CDPH program or partner input and were felt to be important to the reduction of chronic disease incidence, prevalence, and health disparities. Agencies, programs and/or partners identified with an objective may be either data stewards and/or engaged in activities to achieve the target, but may not have adequate resources for statewide activities.  Developmental Objectives will be updated as information becomes available. 

Background: The California Wellness Plan, California's Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Plan was released February 2014 by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).  The overarching goal of CWP is Equity in Health and Wellbeing; additional CWP Goals include: 1) Healthy Communities, 2) Optimal Health Systems Linked with Community Prevention, 3) Accessible and Usable Health Information, and 4) Prevention  Sustainability and Capacity. All CWP objectives fall under the framework of Let's Get Healthy California Task Force priorities. California Wellness Plan - https://archive.cdph.ca.gov/programs/cdcb/Documents/CDPH-CAWellnessPlan2014%20(Agency%20Approved)%20FINAL%202-27-14(Protected)%20rev%20(8).pdf* [Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) County Program Contacts](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/tg6r-siki) - This dataset includes a comprehensive list of all 58 county phone numbers for each respective county eligibility offices, mental health plans, alcohol and drug programs, and Medi-Cal managed care health plans.  These county offices offer assistance to consumers looking to enroll in Medi-Cal or obtain specific services.* [Clostridium Difficile Infections (CDI) in Rehabilitation Facilities, 2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/xzks-ev58) - Rehabilitation hospitals are with inpatient wards for evaluation and restoration of function to patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. These hospitals were self-identified through National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported by California rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  The hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Differences in rates for rehabilitation acute care hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in rehabilitation acute care hospitals is provided separately from the rates in long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals.  Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI.  Also, specifically for LTAC and rehabilitation acute care hospitals, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI.  In this table, hospital rates of CDI for rehabilitation acute care hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable. To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the "Licensed Facility Cross-Walk" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.

Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CDI identified in their facilities.  The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). For more information on data collection processes and methods, please see the "CDI Technical Notes" of the healthcare-associated infections (HAI) report at: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/HAIProgramHome.aspx. Differences in rates for LTAC and rehabilitation hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. Rates from rehabilitation hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable, as there can be as much as a two-fold difference in test sensitivity. Therefore, the rehabilitation hospital-specific rates presented here have not been risk adjusted and are not comparable.* [Hospital Emergency Department Services Utilization Trends-Visits, 2011 - 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/7ha8-yu5i) - The dataset contains Emergency Department Services Level, EMSA Trauma Center Designation Level and Emergency Department visits by acuity for all licensed, comparable hospital in the state of California.* [Clostridium Difficile Infections (CDI) in Hospitals, 2014](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/xkjr-eri4) - This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) standardized infection ratios (SIR) of hospital onset (HO) Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) reported by  California general acute care hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  The HO CDI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of CDI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2014 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent CDI rate data.  CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO CDI incidence include the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital.  Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. Hospitals with NHSN-predicted number of HO CDI cases <1 had no SIRs calculated by NHSN due to less precise comparisons.   For each hospital with a CDI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number.  Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s CDI SIR as indicating: 
• No Different - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, 
• Higher - higher or more infections than predicted, or 
• Lower - lower or fewer infections than predicted.

For more information on data collection processes and methods, please see the "CDI Technical Notes" of the healthcare-associated infections (HAI) report at: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/HAIProgramHome.aspx  The SIRs cannot be compared across hospitals because of "indirect" standardization methodology used in calculating the SIRs.* [Patient Discharge Data By Disposition](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/grsd-atkb) - This dataset contains the distribution of inpatient discharges by disposition for each California hospital for years 2009-to current available year.* [Hospital Emergency Department Services Utilization Trends Overview, 2011-2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/8226-sbg3) - The dataset includes hospital Emergency Department Service (EMS) Level, Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA) Trauma Center Designation Level, EMS treatment stations, ambulance diversion hours, and total EMS visits for all licensed, comparable hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals in California.* [Unemployment 2004-2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/u729-zehn) - This table contains data on the percent of the population in the labor force who are unemployed (unemployment rate), for California, its regions, counties, county divisions, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the  U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS). The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx). Unemployment is associated with higher rates of self-reported poor health, long-term illnesses, higher incidence of risky health behaviors (alcoholism, smoking), and increased mortality. Various explanations have been proposed for the link between poor health and unemployment; for example, economic deprivation that results in reduced access to essential goods and services.  Another explanation is that unemployment causes the loss of latent functions (social contact, social status, time structure and personal identity) which can result in stigma, isolation and loss of self-worth.

This table displays the prevalence of diabetes in California. It contains data for California only. The data are from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). The California BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional health-related telephone survey that collects data about California residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.  The BRFSS is conducted by Sacramento State under contract from CDPH. This prevalence rate does not include pre-diabetes, or gestational diabetes. This is based on the question: "Has a doctor, or nurse or other health professional ever told you that you have diabetes?" The sample size for 2014 was 8,832. NOTE: Denominator data and weighting was taken from the California Department of Finance, not U.S. Census. Values may therefore differ from what has been published in the national BRFSS data tables by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other federal agencies.* [Smoking Prevalence in Adults](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/r3x3-5ydr) - Adult smoking prevalence in California, males and females aged 18+, starting in 1984 from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Current cigarette smoking is defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and now smoking every day or some days. Caution must be used when comparing the percentages of smokers over time as the definition of ‘current smoker’ was broadened in 1996 and the survey methods were changed in 2012. Prior to 1996, the definition of current cigarettes smoking was having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and smoking now. Due to the methodology change in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time.* [Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Bloodstream Infections in Long-Term Acute Care, 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/vk8z-ujw2) - Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs) are defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days. This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA BSI) reported by  California LTACs to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), during the time period January through December 2015. MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for LTACs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted LTAC MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by LTAC hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within this group should still be made with caution.

The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) module of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) asks respondents questions about eight different traumatic childhood experiences that occurred before the age of 18. These include verbal/emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and negative household situations including the incarceration of an adult, alcohol or drug abuse by an adult, violence between adults, mental illness of a household member, and parental divorce or separation. A cumulative ACEs score is calculated for each respondent by counting the number of these items that a respondent reported experiencing, creating a score ranging from 0 to 8.
11 questions about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are condensed into a ordinal scale from 0 to 8 possible ACEs. This indicator shows the prevalence of adults who reported having 1 or more ACEs. However other data cuts are available, e.g., 3 or more ACEs The ACEs module is a very "lagging" indicator capturing childhood experiences retrospectively by asking adults 18+ years of age.  Additional limitations include: 1) relies on self-reported information, 2) provides prevalence, not incidence data, 3) bias or measurement error associated with telephone-administered survey of a sample of the population (e.g., response bias, sampling variation), 4) designed to provide state-level population health estimates and does not provide sub-state estimates or estimates by racial sub-groups (e.g., Asian sub-groups) unless multiple years are combined. Because of the changes in the methodology, researchers are advised to avoid comparing data collected before the changes (up to 2010) with data collected from 2011 and onward: http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2013/pdf/compare_2013.pdf. In addition, due to changes in the insurance variables, the "Other Public" insurance category was not able to be calculated in 2013.* [Healthcare Facility Locations Long Term Care Map](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/gbq6-syqk) - The California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Center for Health Care Quality, Licensing and Certification (L&C) Program  licenses more than 30 types of healthcare facilities.

This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported by California long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals.  The hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Differences in rates for LTAC hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in LTAC hospitals is provided separately from the rates in rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI.  Also, specifically for LTAC and rehabilitation acute care hospitals, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI.  In this table, hospital rates of CDI for LTAC hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable. To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the "Licensed Facility Cross-Walk" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.

Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CDI identified in their facilities.  The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). For more information on data collection processes and methods, please see the "CDI Technical Notes" of the healthcare-associated infections (HAI) report at: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/HAIProgramHome.aspx. Differences in rates for LTAC and rehabilitation hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. Rates from rehabilitation hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable, as there can be as much as a two-fold difference in test sensitivity. Therefore, the rehabilitation hospital-specific rates presented here have not been risk adjusted and are not comparable.* [Hospitalization Counts and Rates of Selected Adverse Hospital Events by California County, 2005-2014](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/bifz-yfav) - The dataset contains hospitalization counts and rates (age 18+), statewide and by county, for 7 potentially-preventable adverse events that occur during a hospital stay.

The data are derived from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). These data are based on self-report from telephone surveys and are subject to bias and low response rates. In 2012, the survey methodology of the BRFS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey included both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the survey, and 3) new methods were used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 – 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond. CDPH and CDC recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time.

The SIR is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period 2006 through 2008, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience. The SIR calculated only if the number of observed is at least one, to enforce a minimum precision criterion and these SIRs are based on the date of procedure, not the date of event. All procedure and infection data entered before May 4, 2015 for surgical procedures performed between January 1 and December 31, 2014 were downloaded from NHSN for this data release. The SIR used for this table is risk adjusted SIR that considers only complex SSI identified during hospital Admission or Readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries and hereafter referred to as SIR.  The hospital submitted procedure counts and infection counts are displayed along with an SIR and, the 95 percent confidence interval for the SIR and the statistical comparison as follow:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       *    No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections                                                                                        •    High -  more infections than predicted,  or

Preterm births are all live births less than 37 weeks of gestation. Very preterm births are all live births less than 32 weeks of gestation. Important growth and development occur throughout pregnancy, especially in the final months and weeks. There is a higher risk of serious disability or death the earlier a baby is born. Gestational age is based on obstetric estimate at delivery (OE). Data includes births with gestational age of 17-47 weeks. Data should not be compared to other data where gestational age is based on the date of last menstrual period (LMP) and not OE. The National Center for Health Statistics recently transitioned to using an OE-based gestational age measure due to increasing evidence of its greater validity compared with the LMP-based measure.

The HO MRSA BSI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of MRSA BSI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2014 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent MRSA BSI rate data.  MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when the first positive blood test is obtained after the third day of hospitalization. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO MRSA BSI incidence include hospital bed size, affiliation with a medical school, and the community burden of MRSA BSI as observed in patients admitted to the hospital. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO MRSA BSI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring MRSA BSI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO MRSA BSI predicted less than one if the number of HO MRSA BSI observed was ≥ 3. For each hospital with a MRSA BSI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s MRSA BSI SIR as indicating: 
• No Different - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, 
• Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or 
• Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.

These hospitals were self-identified through National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA BSI) reported by California free-standing rehabilitation acute care hospitals and rehabilitation units with their own Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certification number (CCN).  MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for REHABs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted REHAB MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within REHABs should still be made with caution. That is, differences in rates within this hospital type can represent other factors besides differences in infection and transmission prevention practices.

It contains all decisions from Independent Medical Reviews (IMR) administered by the DMHC since January 1, 2001. An IMR is an independent review of a denied, delayed, or modified health care service that the health plan has determined to be not medically necessary, experimental/investigational or non-emergent/urgent. If the IMR is decided in an enrollees favor, the health plan must authorize the service or treatment requested.* [Housing Cost Burden, 2006-2010](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/37cg-vrvn) - This table contains data on the percent of households paying more than 30% (or 50%) of monthly household income towards housing costs for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts.  Data is from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Consolidated Planning Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) and the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS). The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx). Affordable, quality housing is central to health, conferring protection from the environment and supporting family life. Housing costs—typically the largest, single expense in a family's budget—also impact decisions that affect health. As housing consumes larger proportions of household income, families have less income for nutrition, health care, transportation, education, etc.  Severe cost burdens may induce poverty—which is associated with developmental and behavioral problems in children and accelerated cognitive and physical decline in adults.  Low-income families and minority communities are disproportionately affected by the lack of affordable, quality housing.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Attachments.* [Medi-Cal Certified Eligibles in Fee for Service (FFS) and Managed Care by Month, 2012-2016](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/t2tc-57iy) - This chart represents statewide counts of Medi-Cal certified eligible individuals who are in FFS combined with Managed Care for each month 2012-2016.

The ratio uses data from the California Department of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. 
Miles traveled by individuals and their choice of mode – car, truck, public transit, walking or bicycling – have a major impact on mobility and population health. Miles traveled by automobile offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming, road traffic injuries, and sedentary lifestyles. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which has many documented health benefits.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.* [Patient Discharge Data By Principal Cause of Injury](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/akbd-yync) - This dataset contains the distribution of inpatient discharges by principal cause of injury for each California hospital for years 2009 to current available year.* [Smoking Prevalence in Female Adults](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/f7gq-hxqm) - Adult smoking prevalence in California, males and females aged 18+, starting in 1984 from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Current cigarette smoking is defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and now smoking every day or some days. Caution must be used when comparing the percentages of smokers over time as the definition of ‘current smoker’ was broadened in 1996 and the survey methods were changed in 2012. Prior to 1996, the definition of current cigarettes smoking was having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and smoking now. Due to the methodology change in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time.* [Patient Discharge Data by Admission Source](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/5mri-8dmr) - This chart displays the distribution of inpatient discharges by source of admission for each California hospital for years 2009-2015.* [Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) in General Care, 2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/brzt-4pvr) - Wards General Care Areas include the following types of locations: stepdown general care locations specializing in patients that are hemodynamically stable; medical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of nonsurgical conditions; medical/surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of medical and/or surgical conditions; surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment for pre- or post-surgical conditions; long-term acute care locations specializing in patients requiring an extended stay in an acute care environment; rehabilitation general care locations providing care to patients who have lost function;  labor, delivery, postpartum general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of normal and high risk pregnancy patients; behavioral general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients with acute psychiatric or behavioral disorders; jail general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients who are in custody of law enforcement during their treatment; and pediatric general care locations providing evaluation or treatment to any patient less than or equal to 18 years of age for any medical or surgical condition. This table shows the hospital-specific central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data by patient care locations classified as Wards. The CLABSI data for each hospital patient care location include number of CLABSIs, central line-days and patient days, CLABSI rates per 1000 line days and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed a statistical analysis to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than California average rates. California average rates for 2013 can be found at https://archive.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2013-CLABSI-T1.pdf. CLABSI rates are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, it cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, readers should consider comparisons between two time periods cautiously, as more time is needed to determine if changes will be sustained, and therefore, more meaningful.

The information is based on a point in time and is expected to be updated monthly.  The data were retrieved from the Provider Master File (PMF), which has been used in the claims payment process and is maintained by the Provider Enrollment Division (PED).  The variables in the dataset include provider number, name, type, specialty, geographic information, etc.  DHCS does not collect information on whether or not fee-for-services providers accept new Medi-Cal patients, and this dataset does not include Managed Care providers.  For information about provider enrollment, please see http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/provgovpart/Pages/PED.aspx.* [Walkable Distance Public Transit, 2008-2012](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/9a5p-mdsd) - This table contains data on the percent of population residing within ½ mile of a major transit stop for four California regions and the counties, cities/towns, and census tracts within the regions.  The percent was calculated using data from four metropolitan planning organizations (San Diego Association of Governments, Southern California Association of Governments, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Sacramento Council of Governments) and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. 
A strong and sustainable transportation system supports safe, reliable, and affordable transportation opportunities for walking, bicycling, and public transit, and helps reduce health inequities by providing more opportunities for access to healthy food, jobs, health care, education, and other essential services. Active and public transportation promote health by enabling individuals to increase their level of physical activity, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease and obesity, improving mental health, and lowering blood pressure.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.* [Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Bloodstream Infections in Rehab Facilities, 2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/5qa4-kxuu) - Rehabilitation acute care hospitals (REHABs) are defined by the Social Security Administration as providing care to evaluate and restore function. This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA BSI) reported by  California REHABs to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), during the time period January through December 2013. MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for REHABs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted REHAB MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within REHABs should still be made with caution. That is, differences in rates within this hospital type can represent other factors besides differences in infection and transmission prevention practices.

The SIR is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period 2006 through 2008, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience. To enforce a minimum precision criterion, an SIR is calculated only if the number of observed infections is at least one. SIRs are based on the date of procedure, not the date of the SSI event. All procedure and infection data entered before May 1, 2014 for surgical procedures performed between January 1 and December 31, 2013 were downloaded from NHSN for this data release. The SIR used for this table is a risk adjusted SIR that considers only complex SSI identified during hospital admission or readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries. The procedure counts and infection counts submitted by each hospital are displayed along with an SIR, the 95 percent confidence interval for the SIR, and the statistical comparison as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       *    No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections                                                                                       •    High -  more infections than predicted,  or

Adult smoking prevalence in California, males and females aged 18+, starting in 2012. Caution must be used when comparing the percentages of smokers over time as the definition of ‘current smoker’ was broadened in 1996, and the survey methods were changed in 2012. Current cigarette smoking is defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and now smoking every day or some days. Due to the methodology change in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time. (For more information, please see the narrative description.)
The California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an on-going telephone survey of randomly selected adults, which collects information on a wide variety of health-related behaviors and preventive health practices related to the leading causes of death and disability such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and injuries. Data are collected monthly from a random sample of the California population aged 18 years and older. The survey has been conducted since 1984 by the California Department of Public Health in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2012, the survey methodology of the California BRFSS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey became dual-frame, with both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the BRFSS, and 3) raking or iterative proportional fitting was used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 – 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond. Center for Disease Control and Policy (CDC) and recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time.Current cigarette smoking was defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and now smoking every day or some days.

This chart displays the Statewide trend in the overall rate of Preventable Hospitalizations for Selected Medical Conditions.  It is based upon Prevention Quality Indicator #90 (PQI 90) - Prevention Quality Overall Composite.  PQI 90 is the composite indicator for 12 ambulatory care sensitive conditions.  Hospitalizations due to these conditions are potentially preventable through access to high-quality outpatient care.  The conditions include: diabetes short-term complications; diabetes long-term complications; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma in older adults (age 40 and over); hypertension; heart failure; dehydration; bacterial pneumonia; urinary tract infection; angina without procedure; uncontrolled diabetes; asthma in younger adults (age 18-39); and lower-extremity amputation among patients with diabetes.  Note: OSHPD is only releasing the first 3 quarters of 2015 data due to a change in the reporting of diagnoses/procedures from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS effective October 1, 2015, and the inability of the AHRQ software to handle both code sets concurrently.* [Asthma Prevalence (Lifetime),  Adults (18 and older) by Year, 2012 to 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/hzkm-8ita) - This dataset contains the estimated percent of California adults (18 and older) with lifetime and current asthma (asthma prevalence), by year. The data are derived from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). These data are based on self-report from telephone surveys and are subject to bias and low response rates. In 2012, the survey methodology of the BRFS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey included both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the survey, and 3) new methods were used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 – 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond.

The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) assigns responsibility for conducting fair hearing requests (appeals) to the California Department of Social Services (CDSS). CDSS receives appeal requests, conducts hearings through their statewide network of administrative law judges, and renders decisions. CDSS provides these services to DHCS through a contract called an interagency agreement. In addition to the interagency agreement, the Delegation Order gives an Administrative Law Judge the authority to review and adopt decisions for hearings. 
Hearing requests (appeals) may be filed for cases involving mixed determinations, such as when household members applied for and/or had eligibility determinations made for the two programs (i.e., parents were eligible for Covered California and the child(ren) were eligible for Medi-Cal). Hearings are held when an appeal filed by an appellant for determinations that resulted in a denial, eligibility, or discontinuance of coverage. This dataset provides categories of hearing results and includes granted, granted in part, denied, or withdrawn/dismissed. This dataset is part of the public reporting requirements set forth in the California Welfare and Institutions Code 14102.5(6).* [Older Americans Act Title IIIC-2 Nutrition Services – Home Delivered Meals Program and Participants](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/wfi4-6pki) - This chart reflects the total number of Californians age 60 and over who were provided a meal from the Older Americans Act Title IIIC-2 Nutrition Services Program – Home Delivered Meals.

A building’s probability of collapse in a strong earthquake is assessed using Multi-Hazard Loss Estimation Technology (HAZUS).* [Subarachnoid Stroke Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings for California Hospitals, Map](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/psvu-jpw6) - This map contains the location of hospitals that treated patients with subarachnoid stroke. The 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 5.0, while the 2013 and 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 4.5.  The differences in the statistical method employed and inclusion and exclusion criteria using different versions can lead to different results. Users should not compare trends of mortality rates over time.  However, many hospitals showed consistent performance over years; “better” performing hospitals may perform better and “worse” performing hospitals may perform worse consistently across years. It also provides inpatient risk-adjusted mortality rates, quality ratings, and number of deaths and cases. This data does not include conditions treated or procedures performed in outpatient settings.

Preterm births are all live births less than 37 weeks of gestation. Very preterm births are all live births less than 32 weeks of gestation. Important growth and development occur throughout pregnancy, especially in the final months and weeks. There is a higher risk of serious disability or death the earlier a baby is born. Gestational age is based on obstetric estimate at delivery (OE). Data includes births with gestational age of 17-47 weeks.                                                                                    Data should not be compared to other data where gestational age is based on the date of last menstrual period (LMP) and not OE. The National Center for Health Statistics recently transitioned to using an OE-based gestational age measure due to increasing evidence  of its greater validity compared with the LMP-based measure.

This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported by California long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals.  The hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Differences in rates for LTAC hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in LTAC hospitals is provided separately from the rates in rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI.  Also, specifically for LTAC and rehabilitation acute care hospitals, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI.  In this table, hospital rates of CDI for LTAC hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable.

Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CDI identified in their facilities.  The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). For more information on data collection processes and methods, please see the "CDI Technical Notes" of the healthcare-associated infections (HAI) report at: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/HAIProgramHome.aspx. Differences in rates for LTAC and rehabilitation hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. Rates from rehabilitation hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable, as there can be as much as a two-fold difference in test sensitivity. Therefore, the rehabilitation hospital-specific rates presented here have not been risk adjusted and are not comparable.* [Clostridium Difficile Infections (CDI) in Hospitals, 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/mrcy-r46b) - This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) standardized infection ratios (SIR) of hospital onset (HO) Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) reported by California general acute care hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  The HO CDI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of CDI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2015 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent CDI rate data.  CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO CDI incidence include the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital.  Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. Hospitals with NHSN-predicted number of HO CDI cases <1 had no SIRs calculated by NHSN. A SIR was calculated by CDPH if the predicted number of infections was <1 and >=0.2. The SIR and its comparison are not as accurate as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections. For a detailed explanation, please see the Technical Notes.   For each hospital with a CDI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number.  Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s CDI SIR as indicating: 
• No Difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, 
• Higher - higher or more infections than predicted, or 
• Lower - lower or fewer infections than predicted.

Data for multiple time periods (2000, 2005-2007, 2008-2010, and 2006-2010) and with race/ethnicity stratification is included in the table. Concentrated poverty is the percentage of the poor living in Census tracts where 40% of the population or higher, are poor. The poverty rate table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx).  Poverty is an important social determinant of health (see http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=39) that can impact people’s access to basic necessities (housing, food, education, jobs, and transportation), and is associated with higher incidence and prevalence of illness, and with reduced access to quality health care.

VRE BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO VRE BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The VRE BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time. The unadjusted VRE BSI rates herein are also affected by clinical and infection control practices and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying VRE BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect VRE BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within type groups (strata) should still be made with caution.

MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for REHABs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted REHAB MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within REHABs should still be made with caution. That is, differences in rates within this hospital type can represent other factors besides differences in infection and transmission prevention practices.

Preterm births are all live births less than 37 weeks of gestation. Very preterm births are all live births less than 32 weeks of gestation. Important growth and development occur throughout pregnancy, especially in the final months and weeks. There is a higher risk of serious disability or death the earlier a baby is born. Gestational age is based on obstetric estimate at delivery (OE). Data includes births with gestational age of 17-47 weeks. Data should not be compared to other data where gestational age is based on the date of last normal menses (LMP) and not OE. The National Center for Health Statistics recently transitioned to using an OE-based gestational age measure due to increasing evidence of its greater validity compared with the LMP-based measure. (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_05.pdf) Note: The race and ethnic groups in this table utilize eight mutually exclusive race and ethnicity categories. These categories are Hispanic and the following Non-Hispanic categories of Multi-Race, African-American, American Indian (includes Eskimo and Aleut), Asian, Pacific Islander (includes Hawaiian), White (includes Other race) and Unknown (includes refused to state and missing).* [Hospital Profitability, 2009-2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/chmy-sb7k) - The dataset contains income statement information for all licensed, comparable hospitals in the state of California.  Kaiser hospitals, state mental hospitals, psychiatric health facilities, and hospitals with mainly long-term care patients are excluded.  Deductions from Revenue, Net Patient Revenue, Net from Operations (Operating Revenue less Operating Expense), and Net Income for public hospitals has been adjusted for Disproportionate Share intergovernmental transfers for funding the Disproportionate Share Hospital Program. The program gets federal matching funds to pay supplemental payments to hospitals with a disproportionate share of uninsured, underinsured, and Medi-Cal patients.* [Clostridium Difficile Infections (CDI) in Hospitals, 2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/rpn8-p5hw) - This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) standardized infection ratios (SIR) of hospital onset (HO) Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) reported by  California general acute care hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  The HO CDI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of CDI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2013 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent CDI rate data.  CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO CDI incidence include the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital.  Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO CDI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring CDI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO CDI predicted less than one if the number of HO CDI observed was greater than zero.  For each hospital with a CDI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number.  Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s CDI SIR as: 
• No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, 
• Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or 
• Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.

Appeals may be filed by an appellant for determinations that resulted in a denial, eligibility, or discontinuance of coverage. A denial is defined as an eligibility determination at application that resulted in a denial of coverage. An appeal regarding an eligibility determination may be filed when the appellant disputes the type of program eligibility. A discontinuance is when an individual is no longer eligible for Medi-Cal or Covered California QHP. Appeals may be filed for cases involving mixed determinations, such as when household members applied for and/or had eligibility determinations made for the two programs (i.e., parents were eligible for Covered California and the child(ren) were eligible for Medi-Cal). Covered California and Medi-Cal eligibility appeals are processed and adjudicated by Administrative Law Judges and the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) staff who track appeals and hearing results. This dataset is part of the public reporting requirements set forth in California Welfare and Institutions Code 14102.5(6).* [Patient Discharge Data By Principal Procedure](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/g7gr-st2e) - This dataset contains the distribution of inpatient discharges by principal procedure group for each California hospital for years 2009 to most current available year.* [Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) in Patient Care Areas, 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/6thh-8aa8) - This 2015 central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates file includes four patient care areas: 1) Critical Care Areas (CCAs) are nursing care areas that provide intensive observation, diagnosis, and therapeutic procedures for patients who are critically ill. These areas exclude step-down, intermediate, or telemetry care areas. 2) Neonatal Critical Care (NCC) Areas specialize in Level II/III and/or Level III critical care provided to newborns and infants. 3) General Care Areas (WARDS) include the following types of locations: stepdown general care locations specializing in patients that are hemodynamically stable; medical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of nonsurgical conditions; medical/surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of medical and/or surgical conditions; surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment for pre- or post-surgical conditions; long-term acute care locations specializing in patients requiring an extended stay in an acute care environment; adult rehabilitation general care locations providing care to patients who have lost function;  labor, delivery, recovery, postpartum general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of normal and high risk pregnancy patients; behavioral general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients with acute psychiatric or behavioral disorders; jail general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients who are in custody of law enforcement during their treatment; pediatric general care locations providing evaluation or treatment to any patient less than or equal to 18 years of age for any medical or surgical condition; and pediatric rehabilitation  locations providing care to patients less than or equal to 18 years of age who have lost function. 4) Special Care Areas (SCA) are nursing care areas which specialize in patients who undergo bone marrow (stem cell) transplant for the treatment of various disorders; or require management and treatment for cancer and/or blood disorders; or require postoperative care after solid organ transplant. This combined CLABSI rates table shows the hospital-specific CLABSI data and central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent by patient care locations in CCAs, NCCs and one treatment area within SCA, "Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care",  Permanent and Temporary Central Line Days. The CLABSI measures include the number of CLABSIs, central line-days, patient days, CLABSI rates and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed statistical analyses to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than the California average rates by patient care locations. We know CLABSI rates are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance procedures, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, this data risk adjusted procedure cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may result from less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including the failure to consistently apply all currently accepted standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect the failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or use more aggressive infection surveillance methods that can include the application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols.

These areas exclude step-down, intermediate, or telemetry care areas. This table shows the hospital-specific central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data and central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent by patient care locations in CCAs excluding neonatal critical care. The CLABSI data for each hospital include number of CLABSIs, central line-days and patient days, CLABSI rates and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed statistical analysis to determine whether the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than California average rates by patient care locations. California average rates for 2013 can be found at https://archive.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2013-CLABSI-T1.pdf. CLABSI rates are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, it cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, readers should consider comparisons between two time periods cautiously, as more time is needed to determine if changes will be sustained, and therefore, more meaningful.

Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/Healthy-Communities-Data-and-Indicators-Project-(HCI).aspx).  Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life.  Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.

The 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 5.0, while the 2013 and 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 4.5.  The differences in the statistical method employed and inclusion and exclusion criteria using different versions can lead to different results. Users should not compare trends of mortality rates over time.  However, many hospitals showed consistent performance over years; “better” performing hospitals may perform better and “worse” performing hospitals may perform worse consistently across years. It also provides inpatient risk-adjusted mortality rates, quality ratings, and number of deaths and cases. This data does not include conditions treated or procedures performed in outpatient settings. Please refer to statewide table for California overall rates.* [Annual Vehicle Miles Traveled per Capita, by California Region, 2002-2010](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/je3q-h5t8) - This table contains data on the annual miles traveled by place of occurrence and by mode of transportation (vehicle, pedestrian, bicycle), for California, its regions, counties, and cities/towns.  The ratio uses data from the California Department of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. 
Miles traveled by individuals and their choice of mode – car, truck, public transit, walking or bicycling – have a major impact on mobility and population health. Miles traveled by automobile offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming, road traffic injuries, and sedentary lifestyles. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which has many documented health benefits.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.* [Patient Discharge Data by Expected Payer](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/yb7u-9r9r) - This chart displays the statewide distribution of inpatient discharges by expected payer for California hospitals for 2009 - 2015.* [Unemployment Rate by Race/Ethnicity, California, 2006-2010](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/vbe9-qkds) - This table contains data on the percent of the population in the labor force who are unemployed (unemployment rate), for California, its regions, counties, county divisions, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the  U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS). The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx). Unemployment is associated with higher rates of self-reported poor health, long-term illnesses, higher incidence of risky health behaviors (alcoholism, smoking), and increased mortality. Various explanations have been proposed for the link between poor health and unemployment; for example, economic deprivation that results in reduced access to essential goods and services.  Another explanation is that unemployment causes the loss of latent functions (social contact, social status, time structure and personal identity) which can result in stigma, isolation and loss of self-worth. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.* [Emergency Department Data, Preferred Language Spoken](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/w4xy-f58p) - This dataset contains the distribution of emergency department encounters and admits by preferred language spoken for each California hospital for years 2010-2015.* [Patient Discharge Data by Age Groups](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/2dtk-8j3b) - This dataset contains the distribution of inpatient discharges by age group for each California hospital, 2009 - 2015.* [Community Care Licensing - Adult Residential Facility Locations](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/w6kr-3ktb) - This dataset contains the location of Adult Residential Facilities (734 Adult Residential Facility for Persons with Special Health Care Needs, 735 Adult Residential, 736 Residential Facility for the Chronically Ill, 772 Social Rehabilitation Facility, and 775 Adult Day Program).* [Pertussis Rates 2001-2014, California](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/xwrq-rubv) - These data contain counts and rates for Centers for Infectious Diseases-related disease cases among California residents by county, disease, sex, and year spanning 2001-2014 (As of September, 2015).* [Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) Bloodstream Infections in Hospitals, 2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/gvxt-ie2f) - This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) vancomycin-resistant Enterococci bloodstream infections (VRE BSI) reported by California general acute care hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), during the time period January through December 2013, grouped by hospital type; see Data Dictionary for definition of different hospital types. VRE BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO VRE BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The VRE BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time. The unadjusted VRE BSI rates herein are also affected by clinical and infection control practices and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying VRE BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect VRE BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within type groups (strata) should still be made with caution.

Data is from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Consolidated Planning Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) and the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS). The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx). Affordable, quality housing is central to health, conferring protection from the environment and supporting family life. Housing costs—typically the largest, single expense in a family's budget—also impact decisions that affect health. As housing consumes larger proportions of household income, families have less income for nutrition, health care, transportation, education, etc.  Severe cost burdens may induce poverty—which is associated with developmental and behavioral problems in children and accelerated cognitive and physical decline in adults.  Low-income families and minority communities are disproportionately affected by the lack of affordable, quality housing.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.* [Total Number of Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) Tests by State Fiscal Year, All Funding Sources](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/rgrh-888z) - This graph displays aggregate level data drawn from the Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) annual report for state fiscal year (SFY) 2008-12 Confidential Screening/Billing Report (PM-160) form used for fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement of services, and/or for reporting preventive health assessment services.  All Funding Sources are listed. The display of the data in this report is intended to provide a detailed view of the health assessments provided to CHDP eligible children and youth as reported to the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) during SFY 2008-12.

CHDP children and youth receive other tests or immunizations against specific infectious diseases according to the age-based CHDP Periodicity Schedule or the other tests or immunizations are considered medically necessary.* [Ischemic Stroke 30-day Mortality Rates for California Hospitals, Map](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/3t4e-tbn9) - This map contains the location of hospitals that treated patients with ischemic stroke. It also provides risk-adjusted 30-day mortality rates, quality ratings, and number of deaths and cases.* [Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Bloodstream Infections in Long-Term Acute Care, 2013](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/yh6a-zr4e) - Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs) are defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days. This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA BSI) reported by  California LTACs to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), during the time period January through December 2013. MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for LTACs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted LTAC MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by LTAC hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within this group should still be made with caution.

The counts of disorders are presented by race/ethnicity groups. The disorders included are part of the core recommended panel (RUSP) put forth by the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) established under the Section 1111 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, 42 U.S.C. 300b-10, as amended in the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008. The Committee recommends that every state newborn screening program include a uniform screening panel that currently includes 31 core disorders; the Genetic Disease Screening program screens for all of the core conditions excluding newborn hearing loss screening and critical congenital heart disease screening which are programs administered by the Department of Health Care Services.

If individual disorder counts were <6, the disorders were combined into a group called "Other rare disorders", as described in the attached Data Dictionary. In addition, race/ethnic groups were combined into larger categories if individual group denominator was less than 20,000 newborns screened during the six year period from 2009-2015. Three types of sickle cell-related hemoglobinopathies (Sickle Beta+ Thalassemia, Sickle S/S Disease and Sickle S/C Disease) were combined into one group called "Sickle Cell Disease".* [Community Care Licensing - Residential Elder Care Facility Locations](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/ayy7-3fr2) - This dataset contains a list of Residential Elder Care facilities (740 Residential Care Elderly and 741 Residential Care for the Elderly (RCFE) - Continuing Care Retirement Community).* [Long-Term Care Ombudsman: Complaints in Residential Care Facility for the Elderly Settings](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/hvkm-zeqk) - This data set reflects the number of complaints the Long-Term Care (LTC) Ombudsman Program received during Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2012, 2013, and 2014 on behalf of residents in Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly (RCFE) settings. The LTC Ombudsman Program identifies, investigates and resolves complaints made by or on behalf of residents in LTC facilities and receives and investigates reports of suspected abuse of elder and dependent adults occurring in LTC and some community care facilities. RCFEs include smaller board and care (6 beds) and larger assisted living facilities licensed by the California Department of Social Services. This data corresponds to federally required complaint categories. Complaints that are still open at the end of the FFY would be included in the following FFY data report.* [Number of Discharges by Top 25 Medicare-Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-DRGs)](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/n65i-pben) - This dataset displays the total number of valid discharges, average charge per stay, average charge per day and average length of stay for the top 25 Medicare-Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-DRGs) for each hospital and for the state as a whole based on the number of discharges.* [Department of Child Support Services Distributed Collections By Assistance Type FFY 2015 - FFY 2016](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/kzdz-mxb2) - This data table provides distributed collection data for California child support cases.

This table displays the percentage of adults meeting Aerobic Physical Activity guidelines in California. It contains data for California only. The data are from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). The California BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional health-related telephone survey that collects data about California residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. The BRFSS is conducted by the Public Health Survey Research Program of California State University, Sacramento under contract from CDPH.
The column percentages are weighted to the 2010 California Department of Finance (DOF) population statistics. Population estimates were obtained from the CA DOF for age, race/ethnicity, and sex.  Values may therefore differ from what has been published in the national BRFSS data tables by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other federal agencies.* [Emergency Department Data By Expected Payer Source](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/fnc2-vsms) - This dataset contains the distribution of emergency department encounters and admits by expected payer for California hospitals years 2010-2015.* [Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) in Long-Term Acute Care, 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/dajj-m7ji) - This table shows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) Standardized Infection Ratios (SIR) adjusted for patient care locations in long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals. The CLABSI data for each LTAC hospital include number of observed (reported) CLABSIs, number of predicted CLABSIs (based on the national baseline data), number of central line-days, CLABSI SIRs and their associated 95% confidence intervals, and the statistical interpretation as follows:                                        
•    No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections     
•    Higher - more infections than predicted, or
•    Lower - fewer infections than predicted. 

CLABSI SIRs are  influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and infection control maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While CLABSI SIRs are only adjusted for patient care locations, they cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI SIRs. A low CLABSI SIR may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may result from less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high SIR may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, SIRs cannot be compared across hospitals because of the limitation in the "indirect" standardization methodology used in calculating the SIRs.

Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CLABSI identified in their facilities.  The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). For more information on data collection processes and methods, please see the "CLABSI Technical Notes" of the healthcare-associated infections (HAI) report at: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/HAI/Pages/HAIProgramHome.aspx* [Long-Term Care Facility Profitability](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/jwsr-qjnr) - This dataset provides Long-Term Care Facility Income Statement Data.* [Percent of Residents Biking to Work by Race/Ethnicity, Population 16 Years of Age or Older, California, 2006-2010](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/rkd9-p5hz) - This table contains data on the percent of residents aged 16 years and older mode of transportation to work for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx).  Commute trips to work represent 19% of travel miles in the United States. The predominant mode – the automobile - offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Automobile commuting has been linked to stress-related health problems. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression. Risk of injury and death in collisions are higher in urban areas with more concentrated vehicle and pedestrian activity.  Bus and rail passengers have a lower risk of injury in collisions than motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience four times the death rate Whites or Asian pedestrians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.* [Voter Registration 2002-2010](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/cchy-svds) - This table contains data on the percent of adults (18 years or older) who are registered voters and the percent of adults who voted in general elections, for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the Statewide Database, University of California Berkeley Law, and the California Secretary of State, Elections Division. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx). Political participation can be associated with the health of a community through two possible mechanisms: through the implementation of social policies or as an indirect measure of social capital.  Disparities in political participation across socioeconomic groups can influence political outcomes and the resulting policies could have an impact on the opportunities available to the poor to live a healthy life.  Although there is no direct evidentiary connection between voter registration or participation and health, there is evidence that populations with higher levels of political participation also have greater social capital, the existence of trust and mutual aid among the members of a society.  There is evidence of a positive association between social capital and lower mortality rates and higher self-assessed health ratings. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.* [California Hospital Inpatient Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/rpkf-ugbp) - The dataset contains risk-adjusted mortality rates, quality ratings, and number of deaths and cases for 6 medical conditions treated (Acute Stroke, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage, Hip Fracture and Pneumonia) and 6 procedures performed (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair, Carotid Endarterectomy, Craniotomy, Esophageal Resection, Pancreatic Resection, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) in California hospitals. The 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 5.0, while the 2013 and 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 4.5.  The differences in the statistical method employed and inclusion and exclusion criteria using different versions can lead to different results. Users should not compare trends of mortality rates over time.  However, many hospitals showed consistent performance over years; “better” performing hospitals may perform better and “worse” performing hospitals may perform worse consistently across years. This dataset does not include conditions treated or procedures performed in outpatient settings. Please refer to statewide table for California overall rates. https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Healthcare/California-Statewide-Inpatient-Mortality-Rates-201/nmyg-79m3* [Rates of Preventable Hospitalizations (Age<18) for Selected Medical Conditions by County](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/6hmm-zzc6) - The dataset contains hospitalization counts and rates, statewide and by county, for 6 conditions plus 3 composite measures.

This dataset list volunteers by thieir based organizations.* [Asthma Prevalence, Adults (18 and older) by Year,  2012 to 2015](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/y6an-nzqq) - This dataset contains the estimated percent of California adults (18 and older) with lifetime and current asthma (asthma prevalence), by year. The data are derived from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). These data are based on self-report from telephone surveys and are subject to bias and low response rates. In 2012, the survey methodology of the BRFS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey included both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the survey, and 3) new methods were used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 – 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond. CDPH and CDC recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time. Please refer to the attachment for AsthmaPrevalence-Adults-by-Year-CA-Description.pdf.* [Ischemic Stroke 30-Day Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings in California Hospitals, 2011-2012](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/u39s-r8np) - This dataset contains risk-adjusted 30-day mortality  rates, quality ratings, and number of deaths and cases for ischemic stroke treated in California hospitals from 2011 to 2012.

The percent was calculated using data from four metropolitan planning organizations (San Diego Association of Governments, Southern California Association of Governments, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Sacramento Council of Governments) and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. 
A strong and sustainable transportation system supports safe, reliable, and affordable transportation opportunities for walking, bicycling, and public transit, and helps reduce health inequities by providing more opportunities for access to healthy food, jobs, health care, education, and other essential services. Active and public transportation promote health by enabling individuals to increase their level of physical activity, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease and obesity, improving mental health, and lowering blood pressure.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.* [Esophageal Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings for California Hospitals, Map](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/rsev-rp4e) - This map contains the location of hospitals that treated patients with esophageal resection. The 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 5.0, while the 2013 and 2014 IMIs were generated using AHRQ Version 4.5.

Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx).  Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life.  Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.

CHDP eligible children and youth are those whose gross family incomes are at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, age restriction for full-scope Medi-Cal of less than 21 years of age, presumptive eligibility (the Gateway process), or children and youth with no health insurance for health assessments who must be less than 19 years of age.  CHDP children and youth receive health assessment services according to the age-based CHDP Periodicity Schedule or when assessments are considered medically necessary.* [School Immunizations in 7th Grade by Academic Year](https://chhs.data.ca.gov/d/trgn-4z3m) - This dataset contains immunization status of 7th grade students in California in schools with 10 or more 7th grade students enrolled. Smaller schools were excluded to help protect privacy. Students in 7th Grade were considered to have up-to-date immunizations if they had completed the Tdap immunization requirement to receive one dose of any immunization (Tdap, DTaP or DTP) that protects against pertussis on or after their 7th birthday. The California Health and Safety Code Section 120325-75 requires students to provide proof of immunization for school and child care entry. Additionally, California Health and Safety Code Section 120375 and California Code of Regulation Section 6075 require all schools and child care facilities to assess and report annually the immunization status of their enrollees.

Under Assembly Bill 354 (2010), California Health and Safety Code Section 120335 required students in 7th grade to provide documentation of either having received a booster immunization against pertussis or an exemption to immunization. This data set summarizes the assessment of the 7th grade pertussis immunization (Tdap) requirement based on reporting from California schools and presents results from the 2014-2015 7th grade assessment and immunization coverage in schools by county.
