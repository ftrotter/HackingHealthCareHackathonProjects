* [IMAGING OF JUPITER ASSOCIATED WITH SL9 IMPACT FLASHES](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sadd-rgt7) - A global imaging campaign (GIC) was organized at sites during the impact of comet Shoemaker-levy 9 with Jupiter. These five sites were Queensland in Australia, the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, Lick Observatory, Mauna Kea Observatory and Reunion Island. All sites used a combination of high speed optical CCD systems with similar broad and narrow band filters.* [Poverty Mapping Project: Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4mne-umwu) - The Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition dataset consists of estimates of the   percentage of children with weight-for-age z-scores that are more than two standard deviations below the median of the NCHS/CDC/WHO   International Reference Population. Data are reported for the most recent year with subnational information available at the time of   development. The data products include a shapefile (vector data) of percentage rates, grids (raster data) of rates (per thousand in   order to preserve precision in integer format), the number of children under five (the rate denominator), and the number of   underweight children under five (the rate numerator), and a tabular dataset of the same and associated data. This dataset is produced   by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Three-Dimensional Health Monitoring of Sandwich Composites, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wzim-4gbj) - This SBIR project delivers a single-chip structural health-monitoring (SHM) system that uses the impedance method to monitor bulk interiors and wave propagation methods to assess surfaces. This Three-Dimensional Health Monitoring (3DHM) unit supports nondestructive evaluation (NDE) systems and evaluates hard shell composites that include sandwich structures.

Implications of the innovation
Increasingly demanding weight and performance needs move manufacturers to the use of composite materials. New systems are needed to detect incipient damage in composites and identify aging-related hazards before they become critical. Three-dimensional health analyzers that actively examine both bulk interiors and large-scale surface areas address a major problem domain; however, no practical system exists. We address this deficiency by building on our existing SHM system.

Technical objectives
3DHM leverages our previous NASA research in SHM. Our current prototype takes the form of a single custom printed circuit board, and is a TRL 5 unit. We have demonstrated bulk interior and limited surface area coverage in Boeing thermal protection system (TPS) tests and on wind turbine blades--both feature composite materials. We extend our surface coverage by adding wave propagation SHM. Our sensor validation includes computer modeling that generates virtual (simulated) data.

Research description
Phase 1 establishes feasibility for a single-chip approach that combines the impedance method and wave propagation, and demonstrates damage detection on a model composite. Phase 2 completes, validates and demonstrates single chip operation, and delivers an operational unit.

Anticipated results
Phase 1 establishes 3DHM feasibility by developing a detailed chip development and verification roadmap. Phase 2 delivers an operational unit that monitors and assesses bulk interiors and surfaces of hard shell composites that include sandwich structures.* [One-Meter Class Drilling for Planetary Exploration, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pu5b-94nz) - The purpose of the proposed effort is to understand and characterize the fundamental limitations of drilling one to three meters into challenging materials which may be encountered in robotic drilling in situ planetary missions. The one-to-three meter range has been identified as a critical regime for planetary exploration; e.g., for potentially identifying subsurface organic material on Mars or polar resource deposits on the Moon. While there has been some technology development in planetary subsurface access, there is currently no surefire flight-like approach to robotically getting to this depth through layers of material like rock (most challenging being basalt), regolith, and icy mixtures. 
In Phase 1, we will experimentally identify the relative utility of rotary vs. rotary percussive drilling in the most challenging target materials under a variety of operational parameters, and extrapolate these results to three meters. Thus far there has been no apples-to-apples comparison of rotary vs. rotary-percussive drilling in this depth regime, though it is believed that rotary-percussive drilling has many advantages over rotary drilling including better penetration in hard targets. This will be a very test-heavy program. We will minimize costs by using an already available test rig - our one-of-a-kind one-meter class lunar drilling platform with rotary and rotary-percussive capability. This is an instrumented rig so we can measure system health and reactions back into the platform and we have the ability to vary drilling operational parameters to test the limits of the system. We will perform tests in Mars and lunar simulant, also readily available in our extensive library of planetary analog materials. Using the lessons learned from Phase 1 and Honeybee Robotics' 13+ years experience in subsurface access and sampling, in Phase 2 we will build a 1-3 meter drill capable of penetrating a representative 3 meter test column of layered Mars and/or lunar simulant.* [Simulating Emerging Space Industries with Agent-Based Modeling, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7rhi-d7zz) - The Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) calls for encouraging commercial participation as a top-level objective. Given current and future commercial activities, how should the government satisfy this objective? How can simulation of future companies determine the most likely to emerge? This innovation seeks to answer such questions envisioning a diverse set of four possible future space companies (orbital habitats/hotels, orbital tourist delivery, propellant depots, lunar excursion tourism, and lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization), examining their business case in spreadsheet-based models (both deterministically and probabilistically), modeling them in a higher fidelity agent-based modeling (ABM) environment (that is new to the aerospace industry but has been used by the authors of the proposal), determining the impact on a company's financial bottom-line, and finding potential cost savings to the government of using those products and services in future space exploration activities. Phase I will entail basic research of each of the four of case studies (or companies) as they are referred to here, spreadsheet-based modeling and analysis of each case study, and preliminary definition of the behaviors required for agent-based modeling. Phase II will entail development of a high fidelity, agent-based model of each company, their competitors, and their customers (commercial and the government).* [Nimbus-7 SMMR Polar Gridded Radiances and Sea Ice Concentrations](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qgqp-urfh) - This data set contains gridded brightness temperatures and sea ice concentrations for both polar regions. It spans the period from October 1978 through August 1987, when the Nimbus-7 SMMR scanner was turned off. The data were collected every other day at 6.60, 10.69, 18.00, 21.00 and 37.00 GHz. Due to spacecraft power limitations, the scanner operated only on alternate days. There are usually at least foutreen days of coverage per month, although major data gaps occurred during the month of August. In August 1982, the following days are missing for both polar regions: 4th, 8th, and 16th; in August 1984, the 13th through the 23rd are missing for both polar regions; and in August 1985, the 6th through 8th are missing for the Southern Hemisphere.

Brightness temperature and sea ice concentration grids have 25 x 25 km grid elements in polar stereographic projection. Volume 7 contains all SMMR sea ice concentrations for both polar regions, plus five months of brightness temperature grids for the North polar region.

Brightness temperature grids are stored as 16-bit integers, one day of brightness temperature data is 0.27 mbytes for the North polar region, 0.21 mbytes for the South. Ice grids are stored as 8-bit integers. Files contain 136192 bytes and 104912 bytes for the North and South respectively. The NASA Team Algorithm (Cavalieri et al. 1984, Gloersen and Cavalieri 1986) was used to calculate ice concentrations from the brightness temperatures. The data were produced by Dr. P. Gloersen, NASA/GSFC, Oceans and Ice Branch, and are available via FTP.

Notice to Data Users: SMMR TCT tapes comprised the input data set, unlike the SMMR Digital Media product distributed by NSIDC in 1979.* [Nimbus-7 SMMR Polar Gridded Radiances and Sea Ice Concentrations](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vsn3-ds9g) - This data set contains gridded brightness temperatures and sea ice concentrations for both polar regions.

In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to be able to assemble and reassemble modules both on the ground and on orbit.  Therefore, it requires a means to join components that is simple, reliable, and non-intrusive as well as strong and stiff enough to withstand multiple connections and disconnections.  AeroAstro?s solution is to apply a new micro-scale mechanical joining technology, Vaccro, to the modular space systems.  Created by VACCO Industries, Vaccro is analogous to ?metal Velcro? in that two surfaces will mechanically adhere to each other upon contact.  Depending on the type of Vaccro used, these bonds can be either permanent or reversible.  With this technology, the surfaces of space system components and modules would be micro-machined with Vaccro features during the ground fabrication process.  With slightly different channel geometries, the surfaces can be peeled apart and rejoined, or they can be made such that the surfaces lock together permanently.  AeroAstro along with VACCO Industries, proposes to determine the specifications for and material qualities of a space suitable Vaccro product.* [Global Annual Average PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/avk9-2ygs) - Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data sets represent a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data. Together the grids provide a continuous surface of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. The satellite AOD retrievals were converted to ground-level concentrations based on a conversion factor developed by researchers at Dalhousie University that accounts for spatial and temporal variations in aerosol properties and vertical structure as derived from a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 30 arc-minutes (0.5 degree or approximately 50 sq. km at the equator) and cover the world from 70°N to 60°S latitude. The grids were produced by researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute in collaboration with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network/Columbia University under a NASA-ROSES project entitled "Using Satellite Data to Develop Environmental Indicators: An Application of NASA Data Products to Support High Level Decisions for National and International Environmental Protection". Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature death as well as increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease, especially in the elderly, young children, and those already suffering from these illnesses. The World Health Organization guideline for PM2.5 average annual exposure is less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms per cubic meter, whereas the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) primary standard is less than or equal to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA primary standards are designed to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.* [Global Cyclone Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gnc5-wyjc) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI) Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation (WASP). Utilizing average monthly precipitation data from 1980 through 2000 at a resolution of 2.5 degrees, WASP assesses the precipitation deficit or surplus over a three month temporal window that is weighted by the magnitude of the seasonal cyclic variation in precipitation. The three months' averages are derived from the precipitation data and the median rainfall for the 21 year period is calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells where the three month running average of precipitation is less than 1 mm per day ae excluded. Drought events are identified when the magnitude of a monthly precipitation deficit is less than or equal to 50 percent of its longterm median value for three or more consecutive months. Grid cells are then divided into 10 classes having an approximately equal number of grid cells. Higher grid cell values denote higher frequencies of drought occurrences. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Venus Altitude Cycling Balloon, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/69un-buqx) - The ISTAR Group ( IG) and team mate Thin Red Line Aerospace (TRLA) propose a Venus altitude cycling balloon (Venus ACB), an innovative superpressure balloon architecture that is ideally suited to cloud level mission parameters and to incorporation of a variety of buoyancy control mechanisms that will enable significant altitude cycling capability.  The 5.5 meter diameter vessel is similar to the dimensions contemplated for higher altitude Venus missions. The pro posse Venus ACB balloon platform is based on TRLA's proprietary Ultra High Performance Vessel ( UHPV). The attributes that set UHPV apart in its unique ability to address the fundamental challenges confronting a cloud level Venus balloon mission capable of significant altitude cycling are described in detail for these seven innovative design elements:   1. Strongest, lightest weight balloon option  2. Balloon fabrication is easier, less expensive, more accurate and highly reproducible  3. Greater performance predictability reduces FOS, which reduces mass  4. Standardized fabric and scalability to size  5. Lighter weight fabric  6. Strongest balloon/polar bulkhead integration  7. Potential for balloon-parachute hybrid vehicle* [Infrared Microspectrometer based on MEOMS Lamellar Grating Interferometer, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fhcq-hp6j) - Infrared spectroscopy is an invaluable detection and measurement tool intensively used in Earth Science, Solar Physics and Astrophysics experiments pursued from satellite platforms. The geometrical characteristics and sensitivity of satellite infrared spectroscopy systems is often determined or limited by their optical elements. Improvements in optical components allow one to reduce the mass and increase the sensitivity of the system.  Here we propose a compact, high sensitivity sensor based on the integration of HgCdTe photodiode detection technology with micro-opto-electromechanical-systems (MOEMS) technology. This combines HgCdTe's high sensitivity with an inexpensive MOEMS lamellar grating interferometer (LGI) device. During Phase I we will perform the optical and mechanical design of the lamellar grating elements, identify suitable processes for fabrication, demonstrate etch processes compatible with the LGI design, and demonstrate prototype lamellar elements. During Phase II, we will further optimize the LGI components, minimize their size, weight and power, and integrate them into an operational LGI. A prototype LGI instrument will be deployed in an environment with controlled input of a variety of low-level test gases. We will develop and test detection-identification algorithms and build a characterization set-up to assess the LGI's sensitivity, selectivity and probability of detection.* [BASIN TCP Stable Isotope Composition of CO2 in Terrestrial Ecosystems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/t7n2-s4ta) - ABSTRACT: This data set reports stable isotope ratio data of CO2 (13C/12C and 18O/16O) associated with photosynthetic and respiratory exchanges across the biosphere-atmosphere boundary. Measurements were made at selected AmeriFlux sites including Harvard Forest, Howland Forest, Rannells Flint Hills Prairie, Niwot Ridge Forest, and the Wind River Canopy Crane Site, which span the dominant ecosystem types of the United States. These data were collected periodically from 2001 through 2004 and are available as an ASCII comma separated file.The goal of this Terrestrial Carbon Processes (TCP) project  is to better capture isotopic effects of ecosystem-atmosphere interaction at diurnal, seasonal and interannual time scales by long-term monitoring 13C of CO2 exchange with the atmosphere at weekly intervals. Photosynthesis and respiration in terrestrial ecosystems have opposite effects on diurnal and seasonal patterns on atmospheric CO2 concentration and isotope ratios.

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

designed to require active water flow and phase separation, or are based
on a passive vapor transport mechanism that inherently limits
performance due to mass-transport limitations.  ElectroChem has
developed and successfully demonstrated a passive water transport
Integrated Flow Field concept (its IFF Structure) that controls the flow
of water through each cell, in a highly reliable, performance enhancing,
and gravity independent manner. By enabling the passive transport of
liquid water to and from the membrane, it simplifies the structure of
the electrolyzer system while avoiding performance limits due to mass
transfer problems that have plagued conventional electrolyzers.
ElectroChem will develop a high performance electrolysis unit that is
based on the passive transport of liquid water into, within, and out of
the cell.  A custom-designed IFF cell structure will be developed during
Phase I to refine approaches to optimized performance under a wide range
of conditions, including gravity independence, higher current, and
prolonged-period stable operation.  The Phase II program will focus on
multi-cell stack development and higher pressure modifications in
support of energy storage systems free of mechanical compressors and
water circulation pumps.* [Advanced Propellants for Scalable, Multipurpose Electrospray Ion Thrusters](https://data.nasa.gov/d/prqd-8gwj) - Ionic liquid ion sources (ILIS) have numerous applications in spacecraft propulsion and focused ion beam technologies. The Space Propulsion Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is developing electrospray ion thrusters for small satellites. Current work is focused on the characterization of ion beams produced by various ionic liquids. Determining the best electrospray propellants and what properties drive their performance is the focus of the proposed work. Additional areas of research include fully characterizing ILIS, increasing the predictability of ion beam properties based on ionic liquid composition, and determining the limitations of ILIS for focused ion beam and spacecraft propulsion applications. Understanding and predicting ILIS beam properties allows for its application to small satellites requiring precise position control as well as ion beam lithography.

Ionic liquids, or molten salts, are liquids at room temperature composed of positive and negative ions. ILIS works by using an electric field to stress the liquid surface, extract ions from the liquid, and accelerate the ions to high velocities. A single ion source consists of a sharp tip coated with ionic liquid, placed close to a metal extraction plate with a hole in it to let the ions pass through. An array of ILIS tips can be used as an electrospray thruster. Electrospray thrusters have many advantages over plasma thrusters. The most significant advantage is that electrospray thrusters are very compact and can be used on small satellites. Plasma thrusters are difficult to scale down for use on small spacecraft because the plasma density must be increased, which greatly decreases the lifetime of the thruster. Because of this, electrospray propulsion has the potential to revolutionize the attitude and position control of small spacecraft.

Less than ten ionic liquids, out of thousands, have been tested as propellants for electrospray thrusters. It is very likely that the best ionic liquids for electrospray propulsion have not been tested in ILIS or have not yet been synthesized. For example, a major source of inefficiency comes from non-uniform beam composition. Determining how liquid composition affects this is the focus of current work. However, beam composition is only a small part of finding the best propellants. Determining how bulk liquid properties like conductivity, surface tension, and viscosity affect performance is another area of study. Additionally, it is critical to investigate how liquid properties affect fundamental ILIS processes: ion evaporation, microfluidics, and interface interactions. A complete understanding of how liquid properties control performance will enable the development of highly efficient, variable thrust electrospray thrusters that can be used as a multipurpose propulsion system. It also will enable the use of electrospray thrusters for precision drag-free spaceflight, possibly like that required by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

Electrospray thrusters and ILIS have the potential to improve small spacecraft propulsive capabilities and focused ion beam technologies. Electrospray thrusters could enable low-cost, small spacecraft to accomplish the scientific goals of large, costly platforms, which is undoubtedly valuable to society. ILIS focused ion beam deposition and etching could vastly improve and expand the possible applications of these technologies by offering thousands of new options for ion beam constituents. Determining the best propellants for electrospray thrusters, investigating the limitations of ILIS, and evaluating the feasibility of a small scale LISA mission is the focus of the proposed work and would be a part of making these electrospray technologies possible.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Diurnal (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/krx8-kw4g) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present.

However, one serious limitation is the mass of the radiator needed for the energy conversion system; the radiator can approach 40% of the vehicle's mass. A novel concept for a lightweight, damage-tolerant thermal radiator was developed at the University of Massachusetts. Preliminary models showed that this concept has the potential to meet or exceed the targets for radiated power per unit mass and per unit area that have been established by NASA for nuclear-electric spacecraft, significantly exceeding the performance of current radiators. It is proposed to use that preliminary work as the basis for designing a more refined implementation, constructing a laboratory model employing the novel architecture, testing it in vacuum chambers at NASA MSFC, and validating the modeled performance.* [IRAS MINOR PLANET SURVEY ASTEROIDS V4.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k8sd-wzqv) - The data presented with this data set include: (a) 8210 individual sightings associated with 2004 asteroids, (b) averaged radiometric diameters and geometric albedos derived from individual observations for 1796 numbered asteroids and 88 unnumbered asteroids (as of 1983) whose orbital elements were determined using astrometry from two or more apparitions; (c) an entry for each of 120 asteroids for which there is an accepted sighting; (d) entries for each of 4677 numbered asteroids and 2632 unnumbered asteroids (as of 1985) for which associations were sought in the IRAS data; (e) A summary of the number of times each asteroid was predicted to be scanned, and possible reasons for any failure to be detected.* [On-Chip hyperspetral imaging system for portable IR spectroscopy applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9n3r-pj8s) - Hyperspectral middlewave infrared and longwave infrared (MWIR/LWIR) imaging systems capable of obtaining hundreds of narrow band (10-15 nm) spectral information of Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and land use in agriculture are of great importance in NASA's Earth remote sensing missions. Existing hyperspectral MWIR/LWIR imaging systems are bulky and heavy and thus not suitable for portable and small satellite applications. This SBIR project aims to develop an on-chip hyerspectral imaging system with integrated narrow-band (15 nm) hyperspectral filers on the pixels of the MWIR/LWIR image array. Successfully developing the proposed innovation will provide an enabling ultra-compact on-chip hyperspectral imaging technology with significantly reduced size, weight, and power consumption suitable for NASA's portable and small satellite earth remote sensing missions. In phase I, the proposed on-chip hyperspctral imaging system will be evaluated and compared with existing technologies. A preliminary MWIR/LWIR photodetector with the integrated plasmonic narrow-band filter will be fabricated and characterized. In Phase II, a prototype of the miniature on-chip mega pixel (1024x1024) MWIR/LWIR hyperspectral imaging system will be developed for laboratory demonstration.* [Energy-Based Acoustic Measurement System for Rocket Noise, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k864-qy2b) - Accurate estimates of the vibroacoustic loading placed on space vehicles and payloads during launch require knowledge of the rocket noise source properties. Given the extreme nature of acoustic environments near the plume, data sufficient to characterize the noise source region have been difficult to acquire. Without these data, structures may be designed to handle insufficient or excessive vibroacoustic loads, resulting in either an overbuilt structure (and extra weight), or an under-designed vibration isolation system that could result in damaged cargos. Current energy-based acoustic probe designs have limited frequency bandwidth due to physical limitations. A new set of probe designs is proposed that incorporate both a new physical probe design but also a more advanced signal processing methodology that will significantly increase the usable frequency bandwidth of the probes while reducing the manufacturing and maintenance costs of the probes. The probe system will also include the design of a complete data acquisition system capable of recording data under the harsh conditions present in typical rocket motor test firings.* [CubeSat High Impulse Propulsion System (CHIPS), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ks9f-nts8) - CU Aerospace proposes the ground test validation of a nanosat primary propulsion subsystem using non-toxic propellant with 3-axis ACS for orbit change and/or de-orbit capability, precision maneuvering, and drag makeup. Our approach, called the CubeSat High Impulse Propulsion System (CHIPS), leverages the existing Micro Propulsion System (MiPS) thruster technology development by our team partner VACCO Industries and enhances it with the CU Aerospace very high efficiency warm gas variant of an innovative resistojet that significantly boosts the performance of standard cold-gas systems. The MiPS system has been tested to 200,000 cycles without any technical issues, demonstrating excellent reliability. The 1.5U CHIPS subsystem, using non-toxic proprietary EP-76 propellant, is a compact thruster system having a total impulse of 602 N-s and a fully throttleable thrust of 50 mN. The subsystem also includes an EP-76 3-axis cold-gas attitude control system.  Approximately 25 W of primary power is required from a battery included in the 1.5U package. The value of this technology is that this low cost subsystem demonstration will pioneer a family of nanosat propulsion systems, based upon an innovative warm gas system and propellant, which will become available to the CubeSat and nanosatellite community for a broad range of propulsion needs.* [TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) Level 1 Raw and Calibrated Radiance Products (TRMM Product 1A11) V6](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3h7e-ahcn) - The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation and to estimate its associated latent heating. TRMM was successfully launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.

The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a nine-channel passive microwave radiometer, which builds on the heritage of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument flown aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. Microwave radiation is emitted by the Earth&apos;s surface and by water droplets within clouds. However, when layers of large ice particles are present in upper cloud regions - a condition highly correlated with heavy rainfall - microwave radiation tends to scatter at frequencies above 19 GHz. The TMI detects radiation at five frequencies chosen to discriminate among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood of rainfall. The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by this method is the deduction of cloud precipitation consistent with the radiation measurement at each frequency. The TMI frequencies are 10.65, 19.35, 37 and 85.5 GHz (dual polarization), and 21 GHz (vertical polarization only).

The Level 1A product file (1A11) is a concatenation of the Level 0 data with a header record and, as such, is reversible to Level 0. The header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbit number, times of the first scan and number of scans, among other things. The Level 0 data contain the actual channel data expressed as &quot;sensor counts.&quot; A file contains data for a single orbit with a file size of about 7 MB (uncompressed).  There are 16 files of TMI 1A11 data produced per day.

Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.

TRMM V6 vs. V7 Major Data Format Changes: http://pps.gsfc.nasa.gov/Documents/formatChangesV7.pdf* [Complementary Flyover and Surface Exploration of Planetary Destinations Where 3D Detail Matters](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tk7i-kdcc) - Points of persistent light exist on the rim of Shackleton crater and at other polar locations on the Moon, and perhaps Mercury. These destinations could serve as bases of operations or power stations for exploitation of polar resources. While sunlight is not truly eternal at these sites, the periods of illumination are much longer than elsewhere on the Moon. Solar-powered robots can explore these locations, hibernating through the short periods of darkness or moving from one oasis of light to another. But, for polar destinations, even small rocks cast long shadows, and unexpected shadows can be mission-ending for small rovers. Precise knowledge of 3D structure on the meter-scale and smaller is needed to predict where shadows will fall.

Sub-surface caverns may be the best place on Mars to find life. They may be the best hope for human habitation on the Moon. They can serve as safe havens that shield robots, astronauts, and structures from radiation, micrometeorites, dust storms, and temperature extremes. They also provide windows into a planet’s past geology, climate, and even biology. Skylights, formed by partial cave ceiling collapse, provide access to sub-surface voids. They have been conclusively shown to exist on Mars and the Moon, and evidence supports their existence on other planetary bodies throughout the solar system. Because skylights are so new and so unknown, it is much too risky to send astronauts, or even complex and expensive robotic systems, to explore these holes and the caverns below without prior reconnaissance. Surface robots can approach a skylight and scan the walls, but skylight geometry prevents viewing the floor of the hole from a surface perspective.

This research proposes complementary flyover and surface exploration for reconnaissance of point destinations, like skylights and polar crater rims, where local 3D detail matters. This reconnaissance is different from previous approaches to planetary exploration: it must detail the geometry of high-relief point targets partially obscured by terrain, not simply characterize regions. Lander flyover captures detailed overview data, as well as perspectives that cannot be observed from a rover viewpoint. Rovers can capture close-up images of the terrain, and they can linger to capture multiple views from stationary locations, though always from low, grazing perspectives. Alternately, landers can acquire bird’s-eye views but with less detail and resolution since their one-pass, always-moving trajectories are constrained by fuel limitations. Lander and rover data are combined, using lander data to localize and plan rover paths, to autonomously construct quality 3D models of point destinations.

Both cameras and active sensors, such as LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging), are used for model construction in the proposed approach. Active sensing is needed to peer into shadowed regions, but active sensors do not have the resolution that can be achieved with cameras and are range-limited by available power. Camera and LIDAR data are fused into high-fidelity models, but the real value in having both data types comes when localizing rovers within maps built from lander data. Difference in perspective between rover and flyover (lander or orbiter) data has traditionally been a stumbling block for automation of rover localization. This research proposes to solve the problem by taking full advantage of 3D and visual data, both in maps and in rover data. Approaches using both 3D and visual features simultaneously will be explored, as well as approaches that use one data type for coarse localization and another for refinement.

To facilitate exploration even in communications-limited areas, and to increase the efficiency with which exploration operations are performed, a fully autonomous modeling approach is proposed. Rover paths and views are planned autonomously, using next-best-view concepts, to fill holes and investigate areas of interest within a lander model.* [ABoVE: Study Domain and Standard Reference Grids, Version 2](https://data.nasa.gov/d/unsd-wvxf) - The Arctic - Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) has developed two standardized spatial data products to expedite coordination of research activities and to facilitate data interoperability. The ABoVE Study Domain encompasses the Arctic and boreal regions of Alaska, USA, and the western provinces of Canada, North America. Core and Extended study regions have been designated within this Domain and are provided in both a vector representation (Shapefile) and a raster representation (GeoTIFF at 1,000-meter spatial resolution). A standard Reference Grid System has been developed to cover the entire Study Domain and also extends to the eastern portion of North America. This Reference Grid is provided as nested polygon grids at scales of 240, 30, and 5 meter spatial resolution. The 5 meter grid is new in Version 2. Note that the designated standard projection for the all ABoVE products is the Canadian Albers Equal Area projection.* [Four-Mirror Freeform Reflective Imaging Systems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5aqh-tq5c) - Central Objectives: The research involves a revelation of the solution space for revolutionary families of four-mirror freeform reflective imaging systems. A freeform optical system is one that lacks rotational symmetry, meaning there is no constraint on the surface shape of the mirrors. Freeform designs can mitigate the disadvantages that prevent reflective systems from being used in larger field of view applications by yielding unobscured designs and leveraging the added freedom of surface shape to better correct the optical aberrations in the system. Freeform designs are made unobscured by breaking the axis of rotational-symmetry and tilting the individual elements themselves. They do not require an offset aperture or field bias, which brings a unique advantage in the correction of optical aberrations. By getting the mirrors out of their own way, more surfaces can be introduced. When compared to alternate solutions, whether it is a rotationally symmetric system or an unobscured system with the same number of elements, an increased diffraction-limited field of view has been demonstrated in our group's research.

Methods/Techniques: The exploration of the solution space will be accomplished by expanding upon the work of Andrew Rakich, who derived the analytical solution space for four-mirror anastigmat telescopes. The systems that are yielded from his method have spherical surfaces and an axis of rotational symmetry. These designs will be used as starting points for subsequent freeform designs. Lens design software will be used to optimize the design as the elements are tilted. When tilting elements, very strong astigmatism is introduced. Therefore, toroidal base mirrors for the freeform surfaces are needed for correction. Zernike polynomials are then introduced to the toroidal base shapes to further correct the system. The research aims to explore a variety of targeted research questions that aim to address space technology challenges. The sensitivity of the designs from the solution space to common tolerances will be studied using full-field displays that isolate each aberration and show its dependence over the field, combined with Nodal Aberration Theory that puts tolerances in linear space, making the sensitivity calculation efficient and complete. Special attention will be paid to geometries that may be more conducive to stray light reduction through the use of baffles. Similarly, other geometries may be more conducive to radiation shielding by using the mirror substrates themselves as part of the shielding. The added flexibility of folding geometry allows for the design to be tailored to system engineering constraints that could not be addressed with rotationally symmetric systems or unobscured non-freeform systems. Design approaches to achieve these characteristics will be developed.

Significance: This research will address NASA interests as per the July 2015 technology roadmap item TA 8.2.1.3. A key, driving aspect of this work will be to focus on revealing key flat field Large, low cost, lightweight precision monolithic mirrors that provide a high degree of thermal and dynamic stability, and wavefront sensing and control for Ultra-Stable Large-Aperture UV/Visible/Near-IR telescopes. This research is directly relevant to the Observatories level 2 TABS element, 8.2. More specifically, it is relevant to the level 3 TABS element Mirror Systems. The significance of this work is to provide imaging system designs with larger diffraction-limited etendues than the state-of-the-art, (meaning larger apertures and fields of view), which will make the most of limited package sizes and mass constraints. This will advance the optical instrumentation on space probes as well as observatories on the ground towards new space discoveries and knowledge.* [Design and Analysis of a Practical Heliogyro Blade Control System for Deployment and Flight](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hwkb-sig7) - A heliogyro spacecraft is a specific type of solar sail that generates thrust from the reflection of solar photons. The proposed research for this fellowship will address the limitations of current analytic models and control designs for a heliogyro spacecraft to develop practical solutions. The first objective is to derive new equations of motion for the essential blade dynamics. The reduced order model for a heliogyro spacecraft will include multiple degrees of freedom, coupled dynamics, solar radiation pressure loading and torque source boundary conditions, all of which are lacking from the current analytic models. The second objective is to develop a root control system that effectively damps the structural modes of a heliogyro spacecraft. The final objective is to determine the blade behavior during initial spin-up of the spacecraft and blade deployment. 

The main methods used to accomplish these research objectives will include classical control theory in conjunction with impedance control and a thorough understanding of the blade dynamics. The heliogyro spacecraft modeling will begin with simplified linear assumptions. The coupling and nonlinearities will be added incrementally to the model. 

The propellant-free heliogyro is a long-duration sustainable spacecraft whose maneuverability allows it to attain previously inaccessible orbits for traditional spacecraft. Continuing research in practical heliogyro control will significantly advance the TRL of this innovative design, in turn lowering the cost of existing missions and opening up exciting new mission possibilities.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Diurnal (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9nra-66ww) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

Active fire data for AVHRR/NOAA-12 was produced using a fixed threshold fire detection technique based on the algorithm developed by the Centro de Previsao do Tempo e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC/INPE) (Setzer and Pereira, 1991; Setzer et al., 1994; Setzer and Malingreau, 1996). Active fire data for MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua was produced using a contextual fire detection technique based on NASA-University of Maryland algorithm (Justice et al., 2003; Giglio et al.2003).Resulting fire counts were compared for major biomes of Brazil (Figure 1), the nine states of the Legal Amazon (e.g., Tocantins, Figure 2), and two important road corridors in the Amazon region (Figure 3). In evaluating the daily fire counts, there is a dependence on variations in satellite viewing geometry, overpass time, atmospheric conditions, and fire characteristics (Schroeder et al., 2005). The data provided are the coordinates of daily active vegetation fires in Brazil for 2001 through 2003 at 1km resolution for both AVHRR and MODIS sensors.  Data are provided in both Arcview (shape file format) and ASCII comma separated file formats. Vector files for the major biomes of Brazil, the nine states of the Legal Amazon, and two important road corridors in the Amazon region are also included.* [Health-Enabled Smart Sensor Fusion Technology, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/etpg-bw5p) - It has been proven that the combination of smart sensors with embedded
metadata and wireless technologies present real opportunities for
significant improvements in reliability, cost-benefits, and safety for
remote testing and measurement. Adding robust and self-construct network
protocol for routing will further simplify testing installation process
and increase test network reliability.  While the idea of largely
autonomous sensors is desirable, there are many issues of cooperation
and control that need to be addressed. Specifically, the sensor fusion
and the schema of smart sensor attributes: prediction, planning,
updating, communication, and assimilation.  The IEEE 1451 standard
provides a basic communications link for sensors, but provides no
methods specific to programming a sensor's data processing resources for
data fusion. Combining IEEE 1451 and networked database, as well as
health-enabled smart sensor fusion technology enables user to interface
to sensor network to provide dynamic programming and access/monitor the
health of sensor nodes. The sensor fusion technology is built upon an
open-system architecture with standardized protocol modules/stacks such
as SQL, HTML, XML, MATLAB, and LabVIEW.* [Nimbus-7 SMMR Antenna Temperatures](https://data.nasa.gov/d/iuke-7zfu) - The SMMR Antenna Temperatures (Nimbus-7) data set consists of antenna temperatures from passive microwave radiometers aboard NOAA's Nimbus-7 satellite.

swath format, i.e. the portion of the Earth's surface viewed by the
scanning radiometer. Antenna temperature data are available from NSIDC
from October 1978 to August 1987.

Missions will operate not only in Near Earth round-trip latencies (RTLT) of seconds but also Near Mars RTLT of 10 to 40 minutes.  New classes of collaboration services are required to support the spectrum of Constellation missions and infrastructure.  Integrating popular collaboration tools such as Groove Virtual Office on Constellation C3I space-based components and networks will be a major innovation.  This project proposes experimental use in SBIR Phases II/III of ISS flight and ground capabilities to demonstrate new collaboration services for use in the Constellation program.  These new space-based and terrestrial services will greatly improve communications among all Constellation personnel over current techniques.  The approach includes:  1) Integrate instant messaging, e-mail, transcription, etc. with voice and video communications; 2) Design for automation and autonomy of space-based Constellation components; 3) Evolve development collaboration services into mission collaboration services over time; 4) Promote new collaboration standards, interoperability, standardized interfaces, and modularity; 5) Adapt the collaboration architecture to the ground and space networks and frameworks.  Client-server, peer-to-peer, or a hybrid architecture may be most suitable.* [Crystal Growth of New Radiation Detector Materials in Microgravity, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ggjv-zapm) - RMD proposes to conduct a series of crystal growth experiments on the International Space Station in the SUBSA furnace inside the MSG glovebox to grow crystals of new materials that have shown a good radiation detector response and present a commercial interest. There is a great demand for spectroscopic gamma-ray detectors capable of not only detecting presence and intensity of radiation, but also distinguishing the energy of an emitting isotope with high resolution. Another market is for solid-state neutron detection and dosimetry, where crystals can replace the difficult to obtain 3He gas. RMD is currently researching several detector crystals that have been developed to that stage: TlBr, SrI2:Eu, and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA). These are detector materials of different types for specific applications: TlBr is a semiconductor for gamma-ray detection, SrI2:Eu is a scintillator for gamma-ray detection, and DPA is an organic scintillator for neutron detection.
Crystal growth of these materials presents a number of challenges which limit the yield of high quality crystals or degrade their detector properties. The proposed microgravity research project will focus on developing a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern defect formation during crystal growth of these materials, and correlating those mechanisms to detector properties.
RMD assembled a strong team of experts with significant experience in crystal growth and materials research in microgravity, who are very familiar with the equipment to be utilized for this project. Despite whether our hypotheses are confirmed or disproven, this series of crystal growth experiments in microgravity would allow us to determine which process parameters have the largest impact on quality and yield without interference from convection, in order to focus on optimization of those parameters, for improved production on Earth.* [High Integrity GPS Solution for Trusted Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/m839-w582) - Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) is the most CSWaP compatible safety solution for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and will be mandated for use by the FAA in the National Airspace System (NAS) by 2020. The ongoing miniaturization efforts will continue to enable a cooperative approach to the integration of UAS into NAS moving forward.  A critical limitation of ADS-B is the use of GPS-derived position vector in its broadcast, which can be easily spoofed or jammed, or confused by reflections in urban areas.  We present a low-CSWaP solution to secure and verify the GPS integrity using a novel antenna design so that ADS-B can be used as a trusted vehicle to vehicle communications and navigation link for UAS.* [Bringing 3D Memory Cubes to Space: a "Rad-Hard by Design Study" with an Open Architecture, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mnj3-aex8) - The computing capabilities of onboard spacecraft are a major limiting factor for accomplishing many classes of future missions. Although technology development efforts are underway that will provide improvements to spacecraft CPUs, they do not address the limitations of current onboard memory systems. In addition to CPU upgrades, effective execution of data-intensive operations such as terrain relative navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning and scheduling, and onboard science data processing and analysis require high-bandwidth, low-latency memory systems to maximize processor usage (the ?memory wall?) and provide rapid access to observational data captured by high-data-rate instruments (e.g., Hyperspectral Infrared Imager, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar).
3D ICs, after a long wait, is now a reality. The first mainstream product is 3D memory cubes, where multiple memory tiers (4 DRAM tiers as of 2015) are vertically integrated to offer manifold improvement in size, capacity, speed, and power consumption compared with 2D counterparts. Indeed, these are the memory parts that will truly enable aforementioned missions. Unfortunately, none of these are ready for space. The purpose of this research is to investigate the challenges and opportunities in deploying 3D memory cubes into space missions.* [Milliarcsecond Small Spacecraft Attitude Control System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hww9-abuy) - Busek proposes to develop a highly modular attitude control system (ACS) which will provide orders of magnitude improvements over state-of-the-art alternative ACS for CubeSats. The low inertia of CubeSats combined with vibrational disturbances and resolution limitations of state-of-the-art ACS presently limit body-pointing and position control accuracy. Busek's electrospray thrusters aboard the ESA LISA Pathfinder spacecraft recently demonstrated precision control at nm scales; this work extends that success to CubeSat platforms. Passively fed electrospray thrusters are highly compact, including fully integrated propellant supplies, and are capable of ~100nN thrust at 10's of nN noise. Thrust can be throttled over >25x, to a scalable maximum of 10's of uN.  These traits, combined with >1200s Isp enable these systems to replace traditional reaction wheel ACS; improving pointing error from arcsecs to 10's of milliarcsec. This work addresses critical development gaps, in both thruster-heads and a multi-axis power processing unit with integrated firmware, presently gating the technology. Phase I will focus on establishing a baseline set of data and methodologies permitting detailed verification of the technology and definition of development gaps. The output of existing designs will be scaled to target ACS applicable performance in Task 1, culminating in assembly of two thrusters. A precisely measured performance map including thrust range, resolution and noise will be measured in Task 2 from both thruster heads. Those data will permit PPU system requirements to be defined and will feed development of control laws to be evaluated, in Task 3, using a hardware-in-the-loop precision pointing test apparatus. Electronics requirements will be assessed against existing single-axis architectures and new HV converter measurements in Task 4, along with identification of thruster head development needs; establishing a path towards a full system development in Phase II.* [Micro-Electro-Analytical Sensor for Sensitive, Selective and Rapid Monitoring of Hydrazine in the Presence of Ammonia, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/id7b-c2xy) - Hydrazine, a volatile and flammable colorless liquid, is classified as a carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency. It can cause chromosome aberrations and negatively affect the lungs, liver, spleen, thyroid gland, and central nervous system. NASA's existing hydrazine measurement technology is sensitive, selective and reliable, but it takes 15 minutes to collect and analyze a sample. For future missions beyond Low Earth Orbit, NASA will need a measurement system that responds within 30 seconds without any performance limitations such as lack of specificity and maintenance challenges. To address NASA needs, InnoSense LLC (ISL) proposes to develop micro-electro-analytical sensor for rapid monitoring of hydrazine (Micro-Zin) in the presence of ammonia in spacecraft cabin atmosphere (SCA) for long-term performance without maintenance. Micro-Zin builds on ISL's nanomaterial-based sensor technology and electronic data processing systems. In Phase I, ISL will design and fabricate a Micro-Zin working model. To establish feasibility, we will characterize Micro-Zin's sensitivity, selectivity, response time, and reliability. In Phase II, we will optimize sensor performance with an appropriate prototype.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_ultrarapid](https://data.nasa.gov/d/h955-hsvk) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites.

These components are utilized to protect high power amplifiers (HPA) during the transmit cycle from destabilizing, and potentially harmful, power reflections from the antenna element. During receive cycle these components are utilized to direct lower power received signals with minimal attenuation to the low noise amplifiers (LNA). As such, performance specifications of these ferrite control components, such as bandwidth, insertion loss, isolation, power handling, temperature stability, radiation hardness, and linearity impose strict limitations on the overall system performance.
Over the course of the proposed Ph1 SBIR program self-biased ferrite control components based on highly textured hexagonal ferrite compacts which have the potential to eliminate biasing magnets and significantly reduce the size, cost, and weight of the TRM while concurrently increasing power handling capability, and improving temperature stability and radiation hardness will be investigated. Specifically, a research and development path to realizing high performance self-biased ferrite materials and device designs for operation in space based environments at Ka-band (>27 GHz, 31.5 - 34 GHz targeted) is outlined.* [Adaptable and Reconfigurable Modular Systems (GSFC) - Plug and Play, Distributed Avionics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jpqi-ykjn) - In order to execute the President's Vision for Space Exploration, NASA must find ways to reduce spacecraft cost, complexity, and integration and test time while increasing mission. Modular, reconfigurable satellite technologies are being developed at Goddard Space Flight Center for increasingly ambitious missions involving humans and robots. Development is on-going at both GSFC and the Air Force Research Lab investigating high speed spacecraft data network architectures based on commercial Ethernet protocols. The advantages of an Ethernet network protocol include supporting FPGA implementation, broadcast capability, and most importantly extensive support by commercial standards and infrastructure. MicroSat Systems Inc. is proposing development of an Ethernet version of its modular, plug and play Intelligent Power/Data Ring avionics architecture. MSI's revolutionary architecture provides a modular, plug and play network of standardized attachment nodes distributing power and data management functions.  Since the IPDR network implements a common set of standardized nodes for every interface versus customized cards, the system cost and integration time is reduced to 40-60% of comparable centralized systems.  During the Phase 1 MSI proposes to develop a concept and analyze the benefits of Ethernet protocol in the IPDR architecture and quantify those benefits in a breadboard test environment.* [Wireless Health Monitoring for Large Arrays of MEMS Sensors and Actuators, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5kf7-reaw) - The objective of this Phase I project is to demonstrate an automated on-line structural health monitoring system for aircraft structures using a combination of wireless data acquisition and fault detection filter via a sensing network for vehicle-embedded large arrays of MEMS sensors and actuators. A fault detection filter, whose functions are to identify and localize the damage, is considered as a new concept in the field of structural health monitoring. Sensor validation is implemented in the distributed sensor network to ensure only validated data are sent to the central station for further system utilization. Wireless communication provides a safe, affordable, and more efficient method for the online health monitoring of vehicle subsystems and information monitoring.  It also involves signal processing to support decision-making related to safety, maintenance, or operating procedures.* [Advanced Fire Detector for Space Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k2x5-qahm) - New sensor technology is required to face the challenging tasks associated with future space exploration involving missions to the Moon and Mars. The safety and well-being of the crew critically depends on early detection of threats as well as maintaining stable and acceptable conditions in the crew habitat. Prototype sensor technology being developed on this project addresses both aspects. Carbon monoxide formation is a reliable indicator of evolving fire threats and this gaseous combustion product allows rapid early detection.  A highly sensitive carbon monoxide sensor is proposed for early, fast and unfailing fire detection.  Current fire detectors are prone to fatigue and have insufficient sensitivity, selectivity and time-response.  Smoke detectors cannot detect early stages of combustion and become unreliable if exposed to dust particulates.  A second project part addresses habitat air composition monitoring.  A multi-species device will be developed to simultaneously monitor oxygen, carbon dioxide and moisture. The optical sensors developed on this project have unique features like fast response, high precision and strong species selectivity.  Design criteria such as small footprint, low weight, low power consumption as well as internal calibration and continuous sensor health monitoring will be implemented to provide spaceflight optimized sensors.  An absorption approach using modulation techniques implemented on size optimized platforms will be applied.* [High Efficency Lightweight Radiators, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k4x8-4vvu) - XC Associates proposes to build on prior work to develop and
characterize a very high efficiency, lightweight radiator constructed
from high thermal conductivity carbon fibers.  The radiator will be
suitable for use on instruments carried by future spacecraft.  The phase
I effort will address the thermal performance and size limitations of
the composite design. Since cryogenic applications are becoming more
common the thermal characteristics of the radiator will be measured down
to 45K. Modern spacecraft thermal control needs to be low mass and low
cost. Composite thermal radiators will realize a greater than 60&#37; weight
saving compared to aluminum and the costs can be addressed by the use of
standard technology that can be easily applied to new designs. The major
innovation to be demonstrated by this project is the use of highly
orientated fibers that completely eliminates the low through thickness
thermal conductivity normally associated with traditional carbon fiber
laminates. This highly oriented lay-up also allows the thickness of the
radiator to be tapered down to less than 0.020&quot; while retaining
very high stiffness.  Therefore, the radiator is much thinner than the
equivalent aluminum radiator, which combined with lower density of
composite construction, accounts for the significant weight reduction.* [Miniaturized Lightweight Monopropellant Feed System for Nano- and Micro-satellites, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dgiu-nxxw) - There is a need for viable and practical solutions for utilizing chemical thrusters operating with green monopropellants on small- and micro-satellites and cubesats (100 kg-500 kg and less than 100 kg).  Conventional approaches scale down poorly, due to the size, mass, and power requirements of components needed for high pressure propellant storage and flow control.  For small spacecraft already facing significant mass and volume constraints, these systems severely limit the amount of propellant storage capacity.  
Systima proposes to develop a miniaturized low power propellant feed and flow control system for green monopropellant thrusters that enables use of very low-pressure propellant storage vessels and high efficiency packaging.  The proposed system can provide full feed system and flow control functionality for 0.5 to 1N-scale green monopropellant thrusters while consuming less than 1 Watt.  There are no limitations on the type monopropellant that can be used with Systima's miniaturized pump.  This program will target development of the pump for use with propulsion systems operating with advanced green monopropellant AF-M315E.  This monopropellant has low-toxicity making it easy to store, integrate into modular designs and launch without added costs associated with handling toxic propellants such as hydrazine. In the Phase I program Systima will demonstrate the technology through analysis, and fabrication and testing of critical components.  Phase I testing will evaluate preliminary system operation parameters that will be used to develop an integrated pump concept design.  In Phase II, Systima will design and fabricate an integrated prototype pump system to demonstrate system performance and capability to meet thruster feed system requirements.  Optimization of the design to minimize the system size, weight and power requirements will be conducted for chemical propulsion system integration onto small spacecraft.* [Exploring the Model Design Space for Battery Health Management](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fu3n-xfj9) - Battery Health Management (BHM) is a core enabling technology for the success and widespread adoption of the emerging electric vehicles of today. Although battery chemistries have been studied in detail in literature, an accurate run-time battery life prediction algorithm has eluded us. Current reliability-based techniques are insufficient to manage the use of such batteries when they are an active power source with frequently varying loads in uncertain environments. The amount of usable charge of a battery for a given discharge profile is not only dependent on the starting state-of-charge (SOC), but also other factors like battery health and the discharge or load profile imposed. This paper presents a Particle Filter (PF) based BHM framework with plug-and-play modules for battery models and uncertainty management. The batteries are modeled at three different levels of granularity with associated uncertainty distributions, encoding the basic electrochemical processes of a Lithium-polymer battery. The effects of different choices in the model design space are explored in the context of prediction performance in an electric unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) application with emulated flight profiles.* [Frequency Up-Conversion Detection System with Single Photon Sensitivity within 1-1.8 μm and 3-4 μm for ASCENDS Mission: A Novel Approach to Lidar, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7vt3-mpzm) - PI at ArkLight proposes to implement photon counting detectors at near-IR (1-1.8 microns) and mid-IR (3-4 microns) with single photon sensitivity based on frequency up-conversion during Phase 2, representing an innovative Lidar technology for ASCENDS mission. By working with Prof. Ding at Lehigh University, PI will explore fundamental limits to quantum efficiencies for up-conversion detection at 1.57 microns. She will implement, characterize, and optimize single up-conversion device capable of detecting 1.57 microns and 1.27 microns. She plans to achieve detections of CO2 and O2 using implemented up-conversion device. She will investigate fundamental limits to noises for up-conversion detections. She will compare among PPLN, PPKTP, and PPLT as up-conversion media. She will expand detection wavelengths to cover ranges of 1-1.8 microns and 3-4 microns. She plans to introduce novel techniques for improving performances of up-conversion devices. She will investigate versatility of up-conversion devices under harsh environments. To achieve all these objectives, she has laid out a detailed work plan describing all the specific tasks necessary. Through optimizations, she will achieve the quantum efficiency of 50%, dark count rate of 50 Hz, bandwidth of GHz, electrical consumption of < 1 W, weight of < 1 lb, and dimension of 7x4x4 (all in inches).* [Modeling Space Radiation with Bleomycin](https://data.nasa.gov/d/x9b2-mzb7) - <p>Space radiation is a mixed field of solar particle events (proton) and particles of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) with different energy levels. These radiation events are difficult to model for Human Space Flight research.&nbsp; Currently <strong>b</strong><strong>leomycin</strong> has been widely used as a radiomimetic agent and was often compared to low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) gamma radiation without defined characteristics.</p>

<p>Our recent work suggests that bleomycin induces DNA damage and other cellular stresses resembling those resulted from mixed field radiation with both low and high LET particles. We hypothesize that bleomycin could be used to mimic space radiation in biological systems. Here I propose to further validate this concept with experiments outlined below. If confirmed, bleomycin can be used to treat biological specimen as an easily available model to study effects of space radiation on biological systems and to develop countermeasures for space radiation associated risks.</p>
 <p>During spaceflight, astronauts are exposed to space radiation which increases health risks in cancer development, degenerative tissues, immune systems, and others. Currently, most studies of radiation effects on human were based on single source radiation. In the contrast, space radiation consists of a mixture of protons from solar particle events, , heavy ions from galactic cosmic rays (GCR). There is no easily available method to model effects of space radiation on living organisms. While NASA Space Radiation Laboratory is working on advanced switches to make it possible to have a mixed field radiation with particles of different types and energies, the radiation source will be limited. The effects and outcomes of mixed field radiation are poorly understood due to this limitation. Development of an easily available experimental model for studying effects of mixed field radiation could greatly speed up our progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of damages and responses from exposure to space radiation, and facilitate the discovery of protection and countermeasures against space radiation, which is critical for the mission to Mars.</p>

<p>Recently, we demonstrated that bleomycin-induced DNA damage is of characteristics of those resulted from both low- and high-LET radiation in confluent human fibroblast. Published results showing that the same human fibroblast in confluency had different survival rate after exposure to low- or high-LET radiation. Bleomycin will be used to treat fibroblast under the same growth condition. Survival rates after treatment will be compared to the published results. It was also shown that some radiation countermeasures, e.g., the growth factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are effective against mixed field radiation, but not others, e.g., the thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetic ALXN4100TPO. Effects of those radiation countermeasures against bleomycin treatment would be tested. These tests could provide further evidences for using bleomycin to model mixed field radiation exposure.</p>

<p>This investigation will provide an experimental modeling method for studying effects of GCR and solar particle events. Bleomycin is easily obtained and can be used in cell culture and on animals to induce DNA damage and other cellular stresses. Bleomycin can be used at a low dose for long a long period of time to mimic what astronauts will experience in spaceflight. Candidates of radiation countermeasures could be screened using high-through-put screening technology with bleomycin treated cells. Thus, my proposed study could accelerate research and development to counter space radiation for the Mars mission.</p>

<p>Once this investigation confirms my hypothesis. This modeling method could be used to study effects of mixed field radiation on different celllines or animals, to understand mechanism of molecular responses and actions, and to screen effective countermeasures that can be easily* [Carbon Nanotube-Based Adsorbents for Volatile Air Contaminants, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gmhy-gzvf) - In completing the Phase I SBIR, Agave BioSystems and the Universities Space Research Association, have successfully demonstrated proof of concept for the use of novel carbon nanotube (CNT)-based structures as next generation smart adsorbents for the adsorption and destruction of potentially toxic air contaminants.  Since CNTs have an extremely high surface area, can be readily modified with metals or functional groups, and can function without the mass transfer limitations of traditional activated carbon, they are an ideal material for integration into spacecraft air handling systems.  In the Phase II program, we will build upon the unique structural and chemical nature of carbon nanotubes to construct a prototype system utilizing these smart adsorbents.* [Improved High Efficiency MCPs for Detection of Photons and Large Biomolecules, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hnrx-4wur) - This SBIR Phase I proposes to investigate the use of proprietary coating materials to enhance the sensitivity, efficiency, and lifetime of microchannel plate (MCP) detectors. These detectors would be the basis for novel active layer multi dynode detectors for Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry as well as detectors of energetic photons. Previous work has led to the discovery that these materials have excellent potential for use as enhanced secondary electron emission yield (SEEY) coatings.  We have observed up to a factor of three increase in SEEY from these coatings when compared to commercial detectors. High SEEYs are particularly crucial to the detection of high mass molecules: The low detection efficiency for large biomolecular ions is a major limitation of commercial MCP detectors. Furthermore, the materials under development have high thermal conductivity and sputtering resistance and are thus ideally suited for long life and high count rate detectors. Under this proposal, we intend to undertake a detailed investigation of the use of proprietary coating materials to improve on commercial MCPs. We will characterize the SEEY of these new detectors under the impact of mono-energetic ions, large biomolecules, and x-rays in order to test their potential use for high-mass MS energetic photon applications.* [Gadolinium EUV Multilayers for Solar Imaging Near 60 nm, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8w4d-2g5v) - We propose to develop and commercialize a new class of extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) multilayer coatings containing the rare-earth element
gadolinium (Gd), designed as efficient narrow-band reflective mirror
coatings operating near normal incidence in the 60-65 nm wavelength
range.  This long-wavelength region of the EUV includes the important
solar emission lines O V near l=63.0 nm and Mg X near l=61.0 nm, formed
at intermediate temperatures in the solar atmosphere.   While
narrow-band EUV multilayer coatings are by now widely used in NASA
missions for high-resolution solar imaging at wavelengths shorter than
35 nm, the observations made at those wavelengths probe coronal and
transition region lines formed at either low (e.g., He II at l=30.4 nm)
or high (e.g., numerous Fe lines) temperatures.  In contrast, the 6065
nm wavelength region provides a unique spectral window in which to
observe intermediate-temperature solar emission lines.  However,
efficient multilayer coatings operating in this range have been
unavailable until now.  The successful development of efficient, stable
Gd-based multilayers as we propose, based on preliminary experimental
results, will therefore enable the construction of new high-resolution
solar telescopes tuned to O V or Mg X that will complement existing
multilayer telescopes tuned to shorter EUV wavelengths, thereby
providing more complete temperature coverage, and leading to better
understanding of the solar atmosphere, its variability, and its crucial
role in driving space weather.  EUV imaging instruments incorporating
the multilayer technology we propose to develop may be included in
future missions such as RAM, Solar Probe, and Solar Orbiter, as well as
future GOES satellites and new Explorer-class missions.  The proposed
innovation thus directly supports NASA's SBIR &quot;S3.04 Optical
Devices for Starlight Detection and Wavefront Analysis&quot; subtopic.* [High Energy Density Capacitors, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9bd5-4rty) - Capacitor size and reliability are often limiting factors in pulse power, high speed switching, and power management and distribution (PMAD) systems.   T/J Technologies is addressing these limitations through the development of nanocomposite polypropylene films with enhanced dielectric strength, dielectric coefficient and thermal stability.  These improvements translate to better performance, including higher energy density, higher volumetric efficiency, and increased working temperature.  During phase I of this program, T/J Technologies demonstrated novel nanocomposite dielectric films with a >100% increase in dielectric strength as compared with conventional polypropylene materials, while also realizing modest improvements in dielectric constant.  Future work in phase II will focus on transitioning this new film into a higher volumetric efficiency power filter capacitor technology that will reduce the size and enhance the reliability of NASA PMAD subsystems. The major target for Phase II is to develop and demonstrate an ultra-thin capacitor film with high volumetric efficiency (>50% improvement over State-of-the-art polypropylene capacitors), high temperature (>125?aC), low dissipation factor, and excellent mechanical properties (windability).  This research will enable the development of lighter, more reliable PMAD subsystems for NASA space missions.  Other commercial and defense applications include pulse power conditioning for high power electronics and high voltage AC systems.* [Low-Cost Composite Technology for Large Rocket Payload Fairings, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bsva-cff3) - The Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry states that reducing the cost to orbit is an essential ingredient for progress. This Phase I project will focus on the development of composite sandwich panel technology for large rocket payload fairings that shows promise to greatly reduce production costs compared to current large-fairing constructions.  An innovative foam and fiber preform technology will be used with Vacuum Infusion Process (VIP) molding to produce high-performance, damage-resistant sandwich panel designs that enable cost reductions in tooling, materials, and processing, and that are free of the size limitations imposed by existing autoclaves.  The preforms are fabricated from low-cost fiber forms and foams using high-speed, automated processes.  The preforms work well with VIP molding, an environmentally friendly, non-autoclave process suitable for large, integrated structures.  The orthotropic tailorability of the preforms will be exploited by using a linked local/global design analysis to achieve minimum-weight composite sandwich designs for a selected large-diameter fairing application.  Sandwich panel designs will be fabricated and tested for mechanical and physical properties.  The designs will be assessed by comparing structural performance and projected fairing fabrication costs against the baseline aluminum honeycomb/prepreg/autoclave technology.* [Cell/Tissue Culture Radiation Exposure Facility, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/75h8-q69e) - We propose to develop a Cell/Tissue Culture Radiation Exposure Facility (CTC-REF) to enable radiobiologists to investigate the real-time radiation effects on cells/tissues at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Up to 18 bioreactors with various types of cells/tissues can be placed in the radiation target area for either short- or long-term radiation exposure.  Samples can be taken and fixed automatically at desired time points on site during exposure to the ion beam.  Specimens within the bioreactors can also be moved from the target area to nearby biology laboratories for investigation of delayed radiation effects using a culture transport system that maintains the proper culture environment during specimen transport.  The concept for CTC-REF is an evolution and extension of the hardware already developed by Payload Systems for other space life sciences applications.  The main advantages of CTC-REF over currently available hardware are:  higher sample throughput, automatic sampling and fixation during and after radiation exposure, and accommodation of long-duration, low dose radiation experiments.* [Virtual Sensor Test Instrumentation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sb64-3hux) - Smart sensor combining with embedded metadata and wireless technology presents real opportunities for significant improvements in reliability, cost-benefits, and safety for remote testing and measurement. Adding robust and self-construct network protocol for routing will further simplify testing installation process and increase test network reliability.  The realization of a practical smart sensor system requires the synthesis of several technologies. One must bring together knowledge in the fields of sensors, data processing, distributed systems, and networks. The IEEE 1451 standard provides a basic communications link for sensor nodes, but provides no methods specific to programming a node's data processing resources. An interface must be defined for dynamic programming of sensor nodes. Mobitrum is proposing a virtual sensor test instrumentation for characterization and measurement of ground testing of propulsion systems.  The tool includes: (1) common sensor interface, (2) microprocessor, (3) wireless interface, (4) signal conditioning and ADC/DAC, and (5) on-board EEPROM for metadata storage and executable software to create powerful, scalable, re-configurable, and reliable embedded and distributed test instrument. Virtual sensor is built upon an open-system architecture with standardized protocol modules/stacks easily to interface with industry standards and commonly used software such as IEEE 1451, TEDS, Java, TinyOS, TinyDB, MATLAB, and LabVIEW.* [Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPV) Monitoring System Using Fiber, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gw2a-vbp5) - Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems Corporation (IFOS) proposes, in this Phase 1 SBIR project, to demonstrate the feasibility of innovations based on an ultra-light-weight, ultra-high-speed, multi-channel, optical fiber sensor system for acoustics emissions (AE) monitoring for detection of damage and cracks in composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV). The project goals are to (1) design an ultra-high-speed, high resolution , small-foot-print fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor interrogator, (2) construct a system model, (3) test platform including embedded FBG sensors and (4) develop signal processing algorithms to identify and measure AE signals in the presence of a quasi-static background strain field. The system model will demonstrate proof-of-principle and the test results will provide proof-of-functionality of the proposed sensor system for monitoring AE including using the advanced fiber optic sensor signal processing algorithms.  AE will be measured on composite cylinders performing pencil break or impact hammer tests.  The model test results will be compared to the measurements made concurrently by a standard single channel piezoelectric AE transducer. In Phase 1, IFOS will also develop a Phase 2 strategy plan that includes development and integration strategy, potential demonstration opportunities, program schedule, and estimated costs.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Population](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sazh-xk4j) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Population data sets provide baseline population information as one of the drivers of ecosystem change. The data   helped in estimating the magnitude of regional pressures on ecosystems. The MA Population data sets include Gridded Population of the World (GPW) version 3, population grids from the Global   Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) (alpha version), Global Subnational Infant Mortality Rates (alpha version), and Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition (alpha version)   data.* [Composite Rolled Magnetometer and Instrument Boom, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nf4j-ytr4) - Magnetometers are the most common instrument flown on NASA science missions and interference from onboard electronics requires that these instruments be deployed away from the spacecraft. Particle sensors and electric field sensors can have similar requirements creating a significant need for deployable booms. Currently, these booms are usually custom designed for each spacecraft, resulting in wasted development costs through repetition. The Composite Rolled Magnetometer and Instrument Boom (CROMIB) will be a highly capable, standardized boom for field instruments that can be scaled from 2m long to 12m long. CROMIB is a slit-tube rolled boom that will deploy using strain energy to simplify the storage canister and eliminate the motor and motor electronics. Rolling the boom provides a highly compact stowed volume. Recurring cost will be roughly 1/3 of the cost for custom designing a segmented deployable boom. CROMIB builds upon the composite boom experience gained from rolled solar arrays.* [Nimbus-7 SMMR Polar Gridded Radiances and Sea Ice Concentrations](https://data.nasa.gov/d/96kz-tb2m) - This data set contains gridded brightness temperatures and sea ice concentrations for both polar regions. It spans the period from October 1978 through August 1987, when the Nimbus-7 SMMR scanner was turned off. The data were collected every other day at 6.60, 10.69, 18.00, 21.00 and 37.00 GHz. Due to spacecraft power limitations, the scanner operated only on alternate days. There are usually at least foutreen days of coverage per month, although major data gaps occurred during the month of August. In August 1982, the following days are missing for both polar regions: 4th, 8th, and 16th; in August 1984, the 13th through the 23rd are missing for both polar regions; and in August 1985, the 6th through 8th are missing for the Southern Hemisphere.

Brightness temperature and sea ice concentration grids have 25 x 25 km grid elements in polar stereographic projection. Volume 7 contains all SMMR sea ice concentrations for both polar regions, plus five months of brightness temperature grids for the North polar region.

Brightness temperature grids are stored as 16-bit integers, one day of brightness temperature data is 0.27 mbytes for the North polar region, 0.21 mbytes for the South. Ice grids are stored as 8-bit integers. Files contain 136192 bytes and 104912 bytes for the North and South respectively. The NASA Team Algorithm (Cavalieri et al. 1984, Gloersen and Cavalieri 1986) was used to calculate ice concentrations from the brightness temperatures. The data were produced by Dr. P. Gloersen, NASA/GSFC, Oceans and Ice Branch, and are available via FTP.

Notice to Data Users: SMMR TCT tapes comprised the input data set, unlike the SMMR Digital Media product distributed by NSIDC in 1979.* [Natural Resource Protection and Child Health Indicators, 2012 Release](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qgw3-qctw) - The Natural Resource Protection and Child Health Indicators, 2012 Release, are produced in support of the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation as selection criteria for funding eligibility. These indicators are successors to the Natural Resource Management Index (NRMI), which was produced from 2006 to 2011 and was based on the same underlying data. Like the NRMI, the Natural Resource Protection Indicator (NRPI) and Child Health Indicator (CHI) are based on proximity-to-target scores ranging from 0 to 100 (at target). The NRPI covers 235 countries and is calculated based on the weighted average percentage of biomes under protected status.

The staggering number of fatalities brought about by the ingestion of microbe-contaminated water reflects the severity of this problem and necessitates the need to develop highly efficient microbial monitoring and treatment methods. The monitoring of microbial contamination of water is not only important for the terrestrial usage of water supplies, but is also a vital aspect of securing the success of NASA space missions. Although some in-flight monitoring systems are already in place to continuously monitor the quality of the spacecraft water supply, there remains a great need to develop an all-in-one smart microbe-sensing system that will simultaneously facilitate the detection, removal and treatment of pathogenic contaminants at lower cost and on a smaller footprint. Of all the different sensor systems that are being explored, magnetic-plasmonic nanoparticle sensors remain to be very promising owing to the combined optical sensitivity of the plasmon band that is integrated with the ease of magnetic guided removal and heat generation brought about by the presence of the magnetic nanoparticle component. Along this line, the proposed educational research area will focus on the systematic study of different magnetic-plasmonic nanostructured motifs for the combined apprehension, removal and treatment (ART) of test microbial contaminants in water. By utilizing bioconjugated antibodies that are specific to the target bacterial cell contaminants, the specific adsorption onto the synthesized magnetic-plasmonic nanoparticles will be promoted, which will give rise to optical shifts in the measured plasmon band that can be used to effectively monitor the presence of the microbes in water. Moreover, using an external magnet the captured microbes can be readily separated from the water supply and subsequently treated with magnetically generated heat. As such, the proposed multifunctional nanoparticle sensors will not only benefit space explorations, but will also have a great impact on ground applications.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Time Average 1-hourly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tu6e-gnna) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

These instabilities are extremely complicated due to the myriad potential coupling mechanisms and multiple length and time scales of the combustor and combustion processes. With frequencies greater than 1000 Hz, high-frequency combustion instabilities can impact combustor performance and lead to catastrophic failure due to overheating. Experimental work at Purdue is part of a larger effort to integrate experimentation, high order models, and engineering level models to better predict combustion instability and to better serve future engine design and performance. An absolutely unique experiment is being used to provide a representative unstable flowfield to which the response of propellant combustion can be measured. Imaging processing techniques are used to identify combusting structures in injector flowfields and their response to pressure and velocity instabilities. Combustion light intensity as measured by a filtered high speed camera is used as an indicator of local unsteady heat release. Combining heat release and high frequency pressure measurements, the damping and driving effects of an injector shall be identified based on Rayleighís criterion of instability. These data are compared to high fidelity computer models to distill combustion response functions that can be used in engineering-level models. When fully developed this diagnostic method could be deployed on operational rocket engines to actively control against unstable behavior or implemented on research combustors for more standardized, complete experimental results.* [SMEX03 Site Photographs, Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ftmr-ann2) - The <em>SMEX03 Site Photographs</em> data set includes photographs of the regional study areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA as part of the 2003 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX03).

To allow for rapid sample characterization on the Moon and Mars, the in situ non-destructive Raman detection technique is a highly desirable sensing tool for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. However, current Raman systems deployed in the field are inadequate due to deleterious fluorescence interference. Fluorescence is often several orders of magnitude more intense than Raman scattering signals and its broad structures spectrum could be difficult to remove from Raman spectra. We propose to develop a new infrared fiber-optic Raman sensor that can eliminate fluorescence with significantly improved Raman sensitivity for fast field detections.  The proposed concept is based on recent technology advances in fiber lasers, fiber optic Raman probes and infrared detector arrays.  Innovative infrared fiber-optic Raman sensor enables highly sensitive fluorescence-free Raman analysis and offers flexible remote detection, so that the field spectrometer's overall performance would be intact and extremely flexible for planetary missions. No dispersive Raman system today offers the unique fluorescence elimination for rapid in-situ fiber-optic remote detection.* [Integrated Data Assimilation Architecture, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/b5xg-z26c) - The Integrated Data Assimilation Architecture (IDAA) is a middleware architecture that facilitates the incorporation of heterogeneous sensing and control devices into a unifying system with standardized application interfaces.

Earth Probe, Meteor-3 and Nimbus-7 data are currently reprocessed using the Version-8 algorithm (http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/version8/v8toms_atbd.pdf) . These Version-8 data are archived at NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC).

The total ozone, aerosol index, reflectivity data and UV-B Erythemal irradiances are mapped to a global grid of size 180 x 288 with a Lat/Lon resolution of 1.00 x 1.25 degrees. These data are also stored in the EOS Version of Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). HDF was developed by the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The GES DISC maintains an online Web-based system (Giovanni) for previewing the data, subsetting in ASCII format, and downloading the data and images. The URL for Giovanni is http://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/.

The Level-2 data at instrument resolution(approx 50km x 50km pixel at nadir, in HDF5 EOS format) are also available from the GES DISC.

This will allow the creation of high-speed 20 x 20 mm CZT detectors with 256 to 512 pixels (1 mm or less pitch). Starting with prior proven designs, we will introduce an innovative, patent-pending readout scheme that reduces digitization to only one signal per channel.  We will also replace polling methods with sparse access and an innovative technique that can keep most of the pixels operating while reading out data. These innovations may increase the ASIC event detection rate by orders of magnitude while reducing system power and processing requirements.  These innovations are essential for upgrading current gamma detection technology for future missions. There exists no ASICs today that can come close to achieving this performance.* [Adaptive Flight Envelope Estimation and Protection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u6tq-cden) - Impact Technologies, in collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative flight envelope estimation and protection system for aircraft under damage upset conditions or severe flight variations.  Through the integration of advanced fault detection (IVHM) algorithms, real-time system identification of the damage/faulted aircraft and flight envelop mapping, real-time decision support can be executed autonomously for improving damage tolerance and flight recoverability.  The core tasks to complete of this proposed workscope include: 1) Development of a strong-tracking health identification algorithm for assessing the dynamics and performance limitation of impaired aircraft; 2) Development of the adaptive flight envelope estimation process; 3) Development of the envelope protection algorithm based on adaptive neural networks that can learn the generated online dynamic models; and 4) Demonstration of the proposed technologies under realistic flight control actuator and propulsion fault conditions. A core innovation of this program is the use of the on-line, adaptive learning neural networks that are capable of generating the dynamic models and operational envelop in real-time, which can then be used to estimate limits on the controller commands while preventing envelope exceedances.  The developed techniques will be demonstrated in Phase I using an integrated aircraft model that uses the NASA MAPSS propulsion model and Generic Transport Model (GTM), with eventual demonstration using the NASA Flight Simulator at NASA Langley.* [Solar ENA Imaging Coronagraph Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6yse-kizi) - <p>Observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) provide the only way to observe solar energetic particles (SEPs) where they are accelerated.

All are implemented in a prototype for which we are pursuing an investigational device exemption (IDE) with the FDA. We have developed a concept of expelling small stones from a kidney before they require comminution or surgery. A system to detect and reposition stones based on an OEM diagnostic ultrasound platform has been built and demonstrated to be safe and effective in studies in a porcine model. Commercialization efforts are well underway. Our technology was called a "game changer" in the plenary session of the American Urological Association (AUA) Annual meeting in May 2012.     <p></p>

In vivo studies of our stone clearance system have been shown to be safe and effective. Several studies of safety in pigs have been complete and are in press. These data have been presented to the FDA as part of our application for investigational device exemption for a human feasibility study. <p></p>* [Enabling Large-body Active Debris Removal, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6yge-hpfc) - Research suggests that: (1) orbital debris has reached the point that, even with no future launches, collisions among large-body debris will lead to unstable growth in debris, and (2) removing as few as five large objects each year can stabilize debris growth. For large-body active debris removal (LB-ADR), new technologies are required to safely capture the target debris. The interactions of these complex electromechanical systems (eg. imaging systems, robotic arms and grippers) and controllers pose challenges best addressed by hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) testing. Given the risks inherent in non-cooperative spacecraft proximity operations and the firm requirement that ADR missions do not themselves produce additional debris, realistic ground-based testing is required for risk reduction.

Our approach to HWIL contains two major advancements: (1) novel robotic technologies that overcome the limitations of existing test facilities, and (2) carefully designed spacecraft models capable of thoroughly evaluating every aspect of a capture system. The LASR Lab was built around HOMER, an omnidirectional robot designed and built specifically to emulate the 6-DOF relative-motion trajectories of spacecraft. The Phase I effort validated HOMER's capabilities and reduced to hardware the Dynamic Payload Pendulum (DPP), an actively controlled pendulum that provides the equivalent of a 5-DOF air-bearing. Together, they permit large-scale motion with accurate contact dynamics. Having identified rocket boosters as ideal LB-ADR targets, we investigated the model features necessary for realistic testing of grappling and sensing systems and for accurate dynamic response on the DPP. Leveraging the developments of Phase I and concurrent work on autonomous, vision-based navigation systems at the LASR Lab, we propose to simultaneously advance the TRL of the ground-test facility and the nav systems by performing an end-to-end simulation of an approach and capture of multiple rocket bodies.* [Solar ENA Imaging Coronagraph](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hnfp-fdj2) - <p>Observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) provide the only way to observe solar energetic particles (SEPs) where they are accelerated.

Dual LIBS and Raman measurements ensure high specificity in chemical analysis.  While LIBS identifies trace elements, Raman spectroscopy enables the robotic rover to distinguish complex materials such as hydrous and anhydrous gypsum that indicate the presence of water on a planet.  This system features embedded chemical fingerprinting software for real-time analysis of material signatures, and has a software interface to NASA robotic platforms.  Through POC's compact excitation laser and high-resolution spectral detection subassemblies, LIBRA has unprecedented specificity of material identification in an energy efficient (<10 W), compact (<0.03 cubic meter volume), light (<2 kg) hermetically sealed package that is ruggedized (no moving parts) and optimized for robotic exploration.  In Phase I, POC will demonstrate LIBRA system feasibility by assembling and testing a proof-of-concept laboratory prototype, and investigate issues of space qualification.  In Phase II a fully functional prototype system will be developed and its standoff detection capability from robotic platforms will be demonstrated.* [Low Profile, Low Frequency, Adaptively-Tuned Acoustic Liner, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/acnm-hw8v) - Conventional approaches to aircraft engine noise reduction via passive acoustic liners are limited in performance, particularly at lower frequencies, where improvements are gained through increased liner depth. Typical engine nacelle installation clearances, however, limit liner depth and prevent further improvements in low frequency noise reduction using these conventional approaches.

The proposed innovation addresses these limitations via a low-profile, tunable acoustic liner for modern aircraft engines capable of significant noise attenuation at lower frequencies than currently achievable.  The innovative approach lowers the resonant frequency and enables significant reductions in cavity size and volume.  Significant net weight savings is achieved due to the large reductions in cavity volume (via corresponding decreases in cavity wall surface area).  The end result is lower frequency noise attenuation with simultaneous reductions in liner depth and weight.

The proposed innovations provide the following benefits for acoustic noise reduction:
?  Optimum absorption of sound at frequencies half of those achievable with  currently available technologies 
?  Decreased liner depth
?  Decreased liner weight
?  In-situ, automatic tunability for optimum absorption under different engines and engine conditions.
?  Broadband operation through MDOF performance and individual impedance tuning* [Hybrid Active-Passive Radiation Shielding System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sp9z-cwjd) - <p>A radiation shielding system is proposed that integrates active magnetic fields with passive shielding materials. The objective is to increase the shielding effectiveness against galactic cosmic radiation (GCR).&nbsp; Active shielding alone requires high power, and passive shielding alone requires high mass.&nbsp; The hybrid shield has the potential to address both these issues. &nbsp;</p> <p>The problem is that we have a vision of landing humans on Mars in the 2030s, but we do not yet know how to protect them from the space radiation.&nbsp; We are developing radiation shielding based on integrating active magnetic fields with passive shielding materials to increase the shielding effectiveness against galactic cosmic radiation (GCR).&nbsp; Active shielding alone requires high power, and passive shielding alone requires high mass.&nbsp; The hybrid shield has the potential to address both these issues of power and mass.&nbsp; The goal is to develop an optimized system of hybrid active-passive radiation shielding.&nbsp; Currently, there is no clear-cut solution to shielding humans from GCR during long duration space travel (more than 6 months from Earth to Mars, one way) and during planetary stays for exploration.&nbsp; Two different approaches exist:&nbsp; (1) choose the right passive materials combinations to slow down the GCR and the secondaries arising out of the interactions of the GCR with intervening matter; or (2) use active magnetic fields to deflect the GCR.&nbsp; These two approaches have limitations, necessitating a new approach like the proposed hybrid shielding.&nbsp; In the new hybrid shield approach, the GCR is bent by the magnetic field, and instead of traveling in a straight path it bends and takes a longer path, thus reducing the required mass of the passive shield component.&nbsp; The passive shielding materials reduce the speed of the incoming particles and thereby reduce the required magnetic field intensity and therefore reduce the power requirements of the active shield component.&nbsp; The combined effects of increased path length and reduced particle speed are two critical controlling factors for realizing improved shielding effectiveness.&nbsp; Preliminary results were obtained by using the Geant (Geometry and Tracking) 4 physics code in two-dimensional and three-dimensional radial simulations.&nbsp; The results show reduction in dose equivalent to human phantoms.&nbsp; Viable radiation shielding against GCR can be an enabler for human exploration of space.&nbsp; The success will have a huge impact on human exploration and operations missions in terms of the protection of humans for space exploration.&nbsp; It will be measured by the increased number of safe days in space.&nbsp; The systematic approach using the best and validated simulation tools to develop and down select viable concepts mitigates the risks of this approach.&nbsp; The effort aims to develop a series of simulations providing for analyses of shielding systems in sufficiently realistic detail to enable comprehensive understanding of the benefits provided and the relative merits of various optimizations.&nbsp; Given that the proposed simulation engine uses a Monte&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Carlo approach, it is generally best initially to go with the simplest configuration that meets requirements, so stable statistical results can be achieved more easily and with less computational time.&nbsp; In later steps of the optimization, it is necessary to invest the required time to ensure that the physical processes are accurately implemented, so all the important features are correctly modeled in order to get accurate and meaningful simulations.&nbsp; The potential payoff is high because the resulting hybrid active-passive shield concept could enable long duration space travel and space exploration for humans.&nbsp; This approach might also be useful for developing radiation protection for ion beam therapies on Earth. The progress will be measured by* [Ultraprecision Pointing Accuracy for SmallSat/CubeSat Attitude Control Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wvse-2w8f) - The primary objective of the Phase I investigation is to develop and demonstrate an innovative solution that can enable very high precision pointing accuracy (<0.08 degree nominal; <0.03 degree extended goal) at fast slew rates; providing part of a advanced Smallsat/CubeSat precision attitude determination and control system (PADCS) that can meet emerging very stringent missions requirements.  The Phase I program aim is to design and fabricate initial prototype hardware, including power electronics and Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) modifications as to demonstrating such positional accuracy capability, power cost (peak and average power consumption), slew rates and mass/volume cost of the new solution.  A critical objective of Phase I will be to develop at the decoupled control architecture for the new multi-stage Attitude Control System ACS controller that will be modeled, simulated, and then converted to hardware prototype for Phase I assessments.  This goal is to integrate this prototype controller into a multi-stage (ACS) design hardware emulation testbed and evaluate actual performance before conclusion of the program.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Ecosystems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mbmh-jf8e) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Ecosystems provides data and information on the extent and classification of ecosystems circa 2000, including   coastal, cultivated, forest and woodlands, inland water bodies, islands, marine, mountains (elevation), polar, and urban. The data set also includes socioeconomic reporting units and the   location of regional MA projects. The data were used in a number of different ways in the assessment, contributing to an understanding of how humans have altered ecosystems, how changes in   ecosystem services have affected human well-being, and how ecosystem changes may affect people in future decades.* [Ullage Compatible Optical Sensor for Monitoring Safety Significant Malfunctions, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rsr8-zagq) - Significant emphasis has been placed on aircraft fuel tank safety following the TWA Flight 800 accident in July 1996.  Upon investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the explosion of the center wing tank (CWT) resulted most likely from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture.  The growing concern of aircraft fuel tank safety has taken an added dimension in the post 9/11 world where both commercial and military aircrafts are vulnerable to terrorist attacks utilizing MANPADS (MAN-Portable Air Defense Systems), explosives in shoe/socks, and small arms fire.  Fuel tanks also need protection from explosions caused by ballistic impact, lightning, and other sources of ignition.  In Phase I,  InnoSense LLC has demonstrated the feasibility of an all-optical oxygen sensor capable of detecting oxygen at 40,000 feet elevation down to the ambient level.  This Phase II proposal discusses how InnoSense LLC would develop a prototype and perform field testing. The project team possesses seventy person-years of optical sensor related hardware and software expertise.  InnoSense has attracted $300,000 in Phase III follow-on funding for further engineering.  Innosense will deliver the prototype to NASA, complete with software, manuals, and schematics.* [ESPA Based Secondary Payload Orbit Maneuvering System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dxpx-png5) - Busek Co. Inc. proposes to develop/design an integrated propulsion, power, ACS, and separation module for secondary ESPA payloads. The standardized secondary payload orbit maneuvering system (OMS) will have; 1) 200 W or 600 W Hall effect thruster system for primary propulsion, 2) Xe cold gas thrusters for propulsive ACS, 3) solar array, batteries and power conditioning with steady state power of ¡Ö230/680W and 4) an integral structure that supports the payload and a LightBand separation mechanism for the ESPA ring.
 
The proposed system architecture is based upon an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA).  Because the ESPA OMS has power, avionics, and propulsion, it is a free flying spacecraft capable of delivering payloads to disparate altitudes and inclinations.  In Phase I, Busek will design an OMS to meet NASA mission needs including deploying large numbers of micro satellites and CubeSats.  Preliminary analysis suggests the each secondary OMS can provide 780 m/sec delta velocity to a 125 kg payload.  A key Phase I activity will be a prototypical orbital deployers adapter for clusters of CubeSat.  With this adapter, the system could deliver large numbers of CubeSats to discrete, pre-defined orbits.  Phase II products will include a clustering adapter ready to fly in 2010, along with the OMS propulsion system.* [A Systems Engineering Approach to Electro-Mechanical Actuator Diagnostic and Prognostic Development](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e8t7-qac7) - The authors have formulated a Comprehensive Systems Engineering approach to Electro-Mechanical Actuator (EMA) Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system development. The approach implements software tools to integrate simulation-based design principles and dynamic failure mode and effects analysis. It also provides automated failure mode insertion and propagation analysis, PHM algorithm design and verification, full dynamic simulations, code generation, and validation testing. This process aims to produce the appropriate fault detection and prediction algorithms needed for successful development of an EMA PHM system. 

As an initial use case, the developed approach was implemented to develop and validate a model-based, virtual sensor software package for landing gear EMA PHM. This effort included creation of a dynamic, component-level system model that can be used to virtually sense parameters, detect degradation, isolate probable root cause, and assess severity. This model is also used as a virtual test bed for performing fault insertion analysis to address algorithm development and experimental prioritization. The developed model was validated using data from a test stand, which was specifically constructed for EMA PHM development. The model-based predictor was then coupled with failure mode diagnostics, advanced knowledge fusion, and failure mode progression algorithms to form a complete prototype EMA PHM solution.

These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.* [Live-Axis Turning for the Fabrication of Non-Rotationally Symmetric Optics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9gz5-nq8u) - The goal of this proposal is to develop a new method to create Non-Rotationally Symmetric (NRS) surfaces that overcomes the limitations of the current techniques and is fast, accurate and inexpensive.  Diamond turning (DT) has revolutionized the fabrication of lightweight optical surfaces for defense and science applications such as forward-looking infrared radar and infrared spectrometers.  It has made this impact not only because it can accurately and rapidly fabricate diffractive, refractive and reflective optical surfaces, but because it can create reference features tied to the optical surfaces to guarantee optical alignment.  An emerging trend in optical design is the use of NRS surfaces that reduce complexity, bulk and weight.  To create these surfaces, DT machines have been modified with a low-amplitude Fast Tool Servo, a third axis or a fly-cutter.  The problem with the FTS is its limited range and the other techniques are plagued by thermal drift during long fabrication times.  The proposed Live Axis Turning (LAT) process combines evolving technologies of air bearings, linear motors, high-resolution encoders and high-speed control systems into a moving lightweight toolpost on a conventional DT machine.  The result is a more flexible machine that can increase production and reduce cost for NRS components.* [LBA-ECO LC-39 MODIS Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mrn5-wyn7) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides active fire locations and estimates of annual fire frequencies for South America from 2000-2007. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm. There are 14 data files with this data set: 7 GeoTIFF (.tif) files of fire frequency at MODIS 250 m resolution, where each grid cell value represents the number of days in that year on which active fires were detected, and 7 shape files of active fire locations for the years 2001-2007.* [Distributed Leak Detection System Using Structure-Borne Noise, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j3nz-k7j4) - Manned spacecraft are vulnerable to air leaks caused by micrometeoroid and space debris impact.  The ability to detect and quickly locate and mitigate a pressure vessel breach is critical to the safety of any long duration spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or a proposed lunar base or mission to Mars.  Current NASA protocol for finding a spacecraft leak uses a handheld ultrasonic directional microphone, similar to those widely deployed industrially, to detect the 40 kHz airborne ultrasonic hiss generated by the downstream leak turbulence.  However, known limitations exist regarding the use of airborne ultrasonic emissions for locating leaks in the spacecraft environment because the downstream side of the leak occurs into the vacuum of space, creating reduced leak noise inside the pressure vessel.  Blockages of the transmission of airborne ultrasonic energy by structural components, avionics, and equipment racks also limit the detection range of such systems.  An alternative approach that we propose is to monitor the spacecraft structure itself---the pressure vessel skin---for leak-generated surface-borne ultrasound by means of a flexible and modular electronics package with fully integrated surface sensor arrays, data acquisition electronics, and radio frequency communication capabilities.* [Precision Membrane Optical Shell (PMOS) Technology for RF/Microwave to Lightweight LIDAR Apertures, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/h8ud-94p8) - Membrane Optical Shell Technology (MOST) is an innovative combination of 1) very low areal density (40 to 200g/m2) optically smooth (<20 nm rms), metallic coated reflective membrane thin films, 2) advanced fabrication techniques that transform the films into self supporting shells through the introduction of permanent optically relevant double curvature, and 3) discrete active boundary control to enable rigid body alignment and maintainment of surface figure in face of environmental disturbances.  Areal densities of better than 2 kg/m2 (including actuators) are projected.  Current measured surface figure is  &#8776;1 to 10 microns rms at up to the 15 cm size, and we are poised for further improvements.  Demonstrated material and fabrication techniques are scaleable to at least the 2m+ diameter single surface apertures and larger apertures are possible through segmentation techniques.  Proven stowage and deployment techniques enable space flight application.  We propose advancing 1) the basic fabrication technology and 2) the TRL level of MOST apertures for ground and space based apertures.  The key resulting innovation is implementation of low areal density, compact roll stowable approaches to realize low mass, low cost reflective apertures for RF/Microwave to LIDAR.  Other NASA and DOD applications are expected as precision and aperture size increase.* [Prognostics Enhanced Reconfigurable Control of Electro-Mechanical Actuators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ivck-kxtd) - Actuator systems are employed widely in aerospace, transportation and industrial processes to provide power to critical loads, such as aircraft control surfaces. They must operate reliably and accurately in order for the vehicle / process to complete successfully its designated mission. Incipient actuator failure conditions may severely endanger the operational integrity of the vehicle / process and compromise its mission. The ability to maintain a stable and credible operation, even in the presence of incipient failures, is of paramount importance to accomplish “must achieve” mission objectives. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the fault-tolerant design of critical subsystems, such as an ElectroMechanical Actuator (EMA), that takes advantage of on-line, real-time estimates of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) or Time-to-Failure (TTF) of a failing component and reconfigures the available control authority by trading off system performance with control activity. The primary goal is to complete critical mission objectives within a time window dictated by prognostic algorithms so that the fault mode is accommodated and an acceptable level of performance maintained for the duration of the mission. The proposed fault-tolerant control design is mathematically rigorous, generic and applicable to a variety of application domains. An EMA is used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.* [LBA-ECO LC-18 Hyperion 30-m Surface Reflectance, Mato Grosso, Brazil: July 2004](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wz9h-5qhw) - This image was collected by the Hyperion sensor on 10-July-2004 at 13:16:16 GMT.  It was calibrated to apparent surface reflectance using the ACORN atmospheric model.The Hyperion imager has a spectral range of 400-2500 nm, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, spatial resolution of 30 m, and a swath width of 7.8 km. Sampling is scene based (256 samples, 512 lines) (http://eo1.usgs.gov/sensors.php).  Through these large number of spectral bands, complex land ecosystems can be imaged and accurately classified.Data from the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer may greatly increase our ability to estimate the presence and structural attributes of selective logging in the Amazon Basin using four biogeophysical indicators not yet derived simultaneously from any satellite sensor: 1) green canopy leaf area index; 2) degree of shadowing; 3) presence of exposed soil and; 4) non-photosynthetic vegetation material. Airborne, field and modeling studies have shown that the optical reflectance continuum (400-2500 nm) contains sufficient information to derive estimates of each of these indicators. Our ongoing studies in the eastern Amazon basin also suggest that these four indicators are sensitive to logging intensity. Satellite-based estimates of these indicators should provide a means to quantify both the presence and degree of structural disturbance caused by various logging regimes.* [VIIRS/NPP Active Fires 6-Min L2 Swath 375m NRT](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gudv-u89p) - The VNP14IMG_NRT is a Near Real Time (NRT) S-NPP/VIIRS 375 m active fire detection data product (Schroeder 2014). The product is built on the EOS/MODIS fire product heritage [Kaufman et al., 1998; Giglio et al., 2003], using a multi-spectral contextual algorithm to identify sub-pixel fire activity and other thermal anomalies in the Level 1 (swath) input data. The algorithm uses all five 375 m VIIRS channels to detect fires and separate land, water, and cloud pixels in the image. Additional 750 m channels complement the available VIIRS multispectral data. Those channels are used as input to the baseline active fire detection product, which provides continuity to the EOS/MODIS 1 km Fire and Thermal Anomalies product.

The VIIRS 375 m fire detection data is a Level 2 product based on the input Science Data Record (SDR) Level 1 swath format. The NRT product is currently available through NASA?s the Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE). The data are formatted as HDF4 files. Complementary ASCII files containing the short list of fire pixels detected are also available through LANCE processing systems.

	We propose a three-year effort to upgrade our existing sub-arcsecond Lyman-alpha telescope payload to improve the observing cadence by a factor of 2, increase the signal-to-ratio by a factor of 4, and launch the payload twice. With this upgraded performance, we will be able to investigate a number of scientific questions regarding the structure and heating of the solar atmosphere that address NASA&amp;rsquo;s Strategic Goal to understand the Sun and its effects on Earth and the Solar System. Specifically, the ultra-high resolution and high-temporal cadence VAULT2.0 science program and associated launch campaigns will answer the following five questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;What is the role of Type-II spicules in the transfer of energy and mass across the chromosphere-corona interface? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;Does neutral plasma absorption of the EUV emission from active region moss explain the discrepancies in the models of coronal loop heating? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;Where are the photospheric footpoints of coronal loops? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;What is the structure of coronal holes in the Lyman-alpha temperature range? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;What is the absolute abundance of H I at the base of the solar wind? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite decades of ground-based observations, the chromosphere remains one of the least understood layers of the solar atmosphere because of our limited understanding of the physical processes that govern it. In the last few years, the chromosphere has been propelled to the forefront of solar physics research thanks to spectacular new observations from space (Hinode/SOT and VAULT), and ground (e.g., SOUP, IBIS, DOT, SST), and the advent of sophisticated numerical simulations which are beginning to address the complex physics of the optically thick chromospheric plasmas and are opening up the interpretation of the observations. With these new capabilities come exciting new ideas regarding the role of the chromosphere in supplying the mass and energy to heat the corona, the nature of filaments, and the contribution of chromospheric jets to the solar wind. These ideas are challenging our traditional views of coronal heating (a long-standing mystery of solar physics), the existence of the &amp;lsquo;transition region&amp;rsquo;, the role of neutral plasmas in coronal emission and even the dominance of magnetic fields at coronal heights. The recent SMEX selection of a chromosphere-oriented mission, IRIS, is further evidence for the renewed importance of chromospheric physics. Observational limitations, however, are impeding further development and validation of these ideas. &lt;strong&gt;Both theoretical and observational considerations point to the importance of tracing the mass and energy on &lt;em&gt;small spatial scales through the upper chromosphere and transition region &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(e.g., De Pontieu et al. 2007a, 2009, 2011; Vourlidas et al. 2010). This layer corresponds roughly to the temperature range from 10,000K (ground-based H&amp;alpha;) to 80,000K (space-based HeI). The requirement for high spatial- and temporal-resolution observations in this temperature range cannot be met fully by current instrumentation. Narrow-band, high-resolution images from TRACE, Hinode, STEREO and SOHO have inadequate temperature coverage or poor resolution. The SDO/AIA observations are skewed towards higher temperature plasmas. The SOHO spectrometers CDS and SUMER have good temperature coverage and fidelity, but limited spatial and temporal resolution and more importantly, limited operational lifetime. Hinode/EIS observations are mostly confined to the upper solar atmosphere while SOT observations are confined to the lower chromosphere (&amp;le; 10,000K). The forthcoming IRIS satellite will partially cover the gap between chromosphere and transition region by obtaini* [MISR Level 3 FIRSTLOOK Component Global Land Product covering a day V002](https://data.nasa.gov/d/suv3-tgge) - The MISR Level 3 FIRSTLOOK Component Global Land Product contains a daily statistical summary of directional hemispherical reflectance (DHR), photosynthetically active spectral region (DHR-PAR), DHR for near-infrared band (DHR-NIR), fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), DHR-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface bidectional reflectance factor (BRF) model parameters, classified into six vegetated and one non-vegetated types. This data product is a global summary of the Level 2 land/surface parameters of interest averaged over a day and reported on a geographic grid, with resolution of 0.5 degree by 0.5 degree. The data are for distinct regions associated with associated field campaigns. The FIRSTLOOK processing uses the new time dependence of the Atmospheric and Surface Climatology (TASC) from the same month/previous year. The TASC data set now contains snow-ice and ocean surface wind speed values that are updated on a monthly basis therefore, these data sets cannot be generated until the end of the month. Products generated are distinguished by the presence of FIRSTLOOK in the file names.The MISR instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras which measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global coverage is achieved in nine days. The cameras are arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir, four cameras pointing forward and four cameras pointing aftward. It takes 7 minutes for all ninecameras to view the same surface location. The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid, are 0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees. The spectral band shapes are nominally gaussian, centered at 443, 555, 670, and 865 nm.* [Data Reduction Techniques for Real-time Fault Detection and Diagnosis, and Multiple Fault Inference with Imperfect Tests, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9ujg-ifqj) - Limited downlink data rate constrains the amount of data that can be sent to earth from a spacecraft. Data from the onboard health monitoring sensors needs to be accommodated within a small fraction of this downlink bandwidth. The problem is more acute for interplanetary missions, where the downlink data rate is significantly lower than the low earth orbit missions. Such constraint prohibits transmission of the complete set of health monitoring data. 

This proposed Phase-II effort is geared towards providing enhanced remote diagnostics using limited telemetry bandwidth. Diagnostic accuracy of health management system depends more on the information content of the monitored data, than on its sheer volume. We propose accommodating more information within the allocated downlink bandwidth for health monitoring by performing intelligent data reduction. The onboard data reduction process employs sensor fusion, dimensionality reduction and temporal fusion techniques.* [Poverty Mapping Project: Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pg7t-47w5) - The Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition dataset consists of estimates of the

Ground measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) were made using the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer and Sunfleck PAR ceptometer, respectively, during focused periods from August 20 to August 28, 2000 at a dry grassland site adjacent to the Sua Pan. The 1 km by 1 km sampling grid was a homogeneous, relatively dense grassland, with a height of 20-100 cm and two prevalent grass types, Odyssea paucinervis and Sporobolus spicatus. Associated reflectance measurements were made with the PARABOLA and ASD instruments (Helmlinger et al., 2004a; 2004b).The data files contain measurements of LAI and PAR reflectance and transmission and a description of sky conditions during the sampling periods. With one exception, all measurements were made under clear sky conditions.  PAR data were measured only on the transect scale while LAI are provided at both pixel and transect scales. PAR readings were performed at 93 transect sample points, and LAI readings were performed at 135 (93 transect and 42 subgrid) sample points. Each file also contains mean LAI and PAR values.

The measurements include: air temperature, specific humidity, module of wind speed, downward long wave and shortwave radiation at the surface, surface pressure, precipitation, and carbon dioxide (CO2). These atmospheric data are provided at 1 hour time-steps. These data were used as the standardized forcing data input for the LBA Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-MIP).The LBA-MIP goal was to gain comparative understanding of ecosystem models that simulate energy, water, and CO2 fluxes over the LBA area. The task was to subject all the models to the same forcing and experimental protocol, and to compare the outputs. The protocol is provided as a companion file, lba_mip_protocol4.0_20100309.pdf.The source meteorological observations for the forcing data, from the nine Brazilian flux towers, were recently published as Saleska, et al. (2013). See related data sets. These source data were gap-filled according to the LBA-MIP standard protocol. Note that the CAX forest tower was not included in the MIP. See the companion file driver_data.pdf for additional gap-filling information.There are 34 data products with this data set and they are provided in both text (.txt) and ALMA-compliant NetCDF (.nc) formats. The files have been compressed into nine *.zip files according to site.* [ESPA Based Secondary Payload Orbit Maneuvering System, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g7ay-qwin) - Busek proposes to develop an integrated propulsion, power, ACS, (ProPACS) system for micro-spacecraft deployed from the ESPA ring secondary payload ports. The standardized ProPACS system integrates the essential elements needed for highly capable micro-spacecraft bus including; 1) 600 W Hall effect thruster system for primary propulsion, 2) Xe cold gas thrusters for propulsive ACS, 3) articulated solar array, batteries and power management and distribution (PMAD) system with steady state power of 700W available to the payload when propulsion is off and 4) an integral structure that supports the payload and a LightBand separation mechanism for the ESPA ring.  The ProPACS can provide over 1,800 m/sec deltaV to a 181 kg spacecraft with a 80kg payload.

In Phase 1 ProPACS system architecture design was completed and all major components were identified.  Mass, power, data budgets were developed and major interfaces were specified.  

Phase 2 focus will be on the ProPACS elements with lower TRL to achieve system wide TRL6 at the end of the program.  The thruster will be advanced to near flight level, two PMAD systems will be evaluated and one selected and the ProPACS integral structure supporting the payload and separation ring will be designed and built.* [Hybrid Heat Pipes for High Heat Flux Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2nnh-n32f) - The thermal transport requirements for future spacecraft missions continue to increase, approaching several kilowatts. At the same time the heat acquisition areas have trended downward, thereby increasing the incident heat flux. Current incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2. This is a severe limitation for axial groove aluminum/ammonia constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs). The maximum heat flux in a CCHP is set by the boiling limit, which typically start at 5 W/cm2 for axial grove wicks, and 20-30 W/cm2 for powder metal wicks. The innovation is to develop CCHPs with a hybrid wick, which has a sintered evaporator wick, and a conventional grooved adiabatic and condenser wick.  These hybrid wicks can operate at higher heat fluxes, allowing the use of higher power laser diodes.  They also allow the use of Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) in Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, which must operate at tilts up to 45°.  Conventional aluminum/ammonia heat pipes can only operate with a 0.1 inch tilt, so they are unsuitable.  Loop Heat Pipes can also operate with tilting, but they are two orders of magnitude more expensive.  A hybrid grooved and sintered wick CCHP will allow operating at higher heat fluxes as compared to axial groove design and can also operate against gravity on the planetary surface, operate in space, carrying power over long distances, act as a thermosyphon on the planetary surface for Lunar and Martian landers and rovers, and demonstrate a higher transport capability than an all-sintered wick.* [An Ideal Integrating Bolometer Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/weqe-p8h6) - <p>We propose to develop a novel detector to enable a new class of far-IR spectroscopic surveys.&nbsp; The detector, the Ideal Integrating Bolometer (IIB) is able to circumvent some of the inherent limitations on bolometers, and thus achieve dramatic improvement in sensitivity.<br />&nbsp;</p> <p>An ideal integrating bolometer can achieve breakthrough sensitivity in IR photon detection by removing practical barriers to extreme thermal isolation of the absorber.&nbsp; The effort will be focused on design of the IIB, with the goal of having a layout ready.&nbsp; During this period, we will also design parts needed for the test facility and start fabrication.&nbsp; In the second quarter, the IIBs will be fabricated.&nbsp; Also during this period, the test facility will be assembled and dry run testing completed.&nbsp; In the third quarter, the IIB samples will be installed in the cryostat and tested. The final quarter will be dedicated to further debugging and testing the IIB samples, and completing the final report.<br />&nbsp;</p>* [Long-wave Infrared Detectors for the Planetary Infrared Spectrometers](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g86w-ua2d) - <p>Understanding the role of primitive bodies as building blocks for planets and life are key targets for space exploration. Chemical and mineralogical characterizations are critical components of this exploration. Infrared spectrometers provide a new spectroscopic capability to interrogate the feature-rich region of long-wave infrared. The objective of this work was to develop high performance in house long-wave barrier (8 &mu;m) infrared (LWIR) detectors tailored for the use in planetary spectrometers for characterization of primitive bodies.</p>
 <p>Currently, the major impediment for long wavelength instrumentation is the availability of sensitive detectors that can cover the region of interest &ndash; wavelengths up to approximately 7.5 &mu;m (or wavenumbers less than &asymp; 1330 cm1). Long-wave limits of current and recent spectrometers are 3 &mu;m (M3), 3.92 &mu;m (CRISM), and 5.1 &mu;m (VIMS). While useful for hydrides (and nitriles, CO, and CO2 for VIMS), these limited ranges are unsuitable for detection and characterization of most molecules and minerals of planetary interest and especially organic molecules. As an example, while the C-H stretch band in the 3-&mu;m region can indicate the presence of hydrocarbons, this band is not indicative of the type of chemical or functional group, i. e. alcohols, organic acids, esters, etc. Identification of these molecules requires information from other (and stronger) transitions occurring at longer wavelengths. Detection of such spectra in remote-sensing or in situ applications often requires high sensitivity long-IR detectors, particularly for diffusely reflected sunlight in outer solar system measurements. The high-quality detectors generally required for space and astronomical detectors were originally developed for the military, with the cut-off wavelengths chosen to match spectral transmission windows of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere (below 5 &mu;m for mid-IR and above 10 &mu;m for long-IR regions). Consequently, detectors with cut-off wavelengths between 5 and 10 &mu;m have never been produced in quantity and are not available except expensive custom items (multi million dollars) by external vendors. The unknown detector performance of external vendors such as environmental/planet radiation increases the risk of using detectors from external providers and increases the instrument cost to verify these components under these conditions. Therefore, the costs of such detectors are in the millions of dollar range with lead times longer than one year. This is a major driver in the overall cost of spectroscopic planetary instruments and poses a significant risk to the timely and successful delivery of the instruments. Therefore, the development of an in-house detector capability at the target 8 &mu;m wavelength with a route towards integration into planetary spectrometers takes away the risk and cost associated with external vendors and will make JPL&rsquo;s planetary instruments extremely competitive.</p>* [Automated Service Discovery using Autonomous Control Technologies, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hjc4-2yqs) - With the advent of mobile commerce technologies, the realization of pervasive computing and the formation of ad-hoc networks can be leveraged to the benefit of the NASA Spaceports in several technical areas.  The Automated Service Discovery (ASD) architecture will allow a portable real-time Expert System to be used to aid in the Service Discovery, management of communications links, and fault detection isolation and recovery for vehicle health management.  The ASD system will allow significant cost reductions for fielding and maintaining systems at the Spaceports.  Flight systems can save weight by relying on encrypted wireless links rather than connections to a wiring harness for data transfer.  Ground based systems can reconfigure on the fly using wireless and connection oriented ad-hoc networks.

This proposal also addresses the need for a standardized command, control and monitor system for ground and space infrastructure.  ASD will use the same Expert System for execution of the ASD algorithms to derive suggestions for least-cost paths for data connectivity.   The ASD system will provide a capability for the real-time Expert System to query for service capabilities and adjust goals and constraints based on available resources.  The ASD implementation will be machine, language, and operating system neutral.* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jwm3-dnmz) - ABSTRACT: The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. FASIR-NDVI data are also used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface. There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.* [Intelligent Flamefinder Detection and Alert System (IFDAS), Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/svtp-cpga) - Current hydrogen flame detection systems exhibit shortcomings ranging from limited detection range, to localization inaccuracy, limited sensitivity, false alarms, and inability to self-diagnose failures. During Phase I. International Electronic Machines Corporation IEM created and tested a prototype version of an Intelligent FlameFinder Detection and Alert System (IFDAS), demonstrating that IEM's system could accurately detect, track, and localize hydrogen flames and reliably discriminate between hydrogen flames and over two dozen sources of false alarms including reflections of flames or the sun, welding, other flame sources, etc., using a unique, innovative, and expandable Flame Detection Expert System design. In Phase II, IEM proposes to develop a full working prototype system employing multiple IFDAS sensor units, an enhanced flame detection expert system, and a comprehensive user interface including means for notifying emergency personnel when a fire is detected. This IFDAS Prototype will be demonstrated under real-world conditions at Stennis Space Center.* [MOPITT Beta CO gridded monthly means (Near and Thermal Infrared Radiances) V107](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qwyv-wv5x) - The MOPITT Beta L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals and belong to an unvalidated beta product subject to recalibration.

Data from the MODIS sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm.* [NACP MsTMIP: Global and North American Driver Data for Multi-Model Intercomparison](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bnde-mmt8) - This data set provides environmental data that have been standardized and aggregated for use as input to carbon cycle models at global (0.5-degree resolution) and regional (North America at 0.25-degree resolution) scales. The data were compiled from selected sources (Table 2) and integrated into gridded global and regional collections of climatology variables (precipitation, air temperature, air specific humidity, air relative humidity (NA only), pressure, downward longwave radiation, downward shortwave radiation, and wind speed), time-varying atmospheric CO2 concentrations, time-varying nitrogen deposition, biome fraction and type, land-use and land-cover change, C3/C4 grasses fractions, major crop distribution, phenology, multiple soil characteristics, and a land-water mask. The temporal ranges of the data are sufficient for carbon cycle model simulations from 1801 to 2010. These data were compiled specifically for the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Multi-Scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) as the prescribed model input driver data (Huntzinger et al., 2013). The driver data were used by 22 terrestrial biosphere models to run baseline and sensitivity simulations. The standardized data provided consistent model inputs to minimize the inter-model variability caused by differences in environmental drivers and initial conditions. Together with the sensitivity simulations, the standardized input data enable better interpretation and quantification of structural and parameter uncertainties of model estimates. Data are provided in Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata convention compliant (version 1.4) netCDF-4 file formats. There are 3,152 *.nc4 data files with this data set.* [NACP Regional: National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Aggregated Gridded Model Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gyxx-yj86) - This data set provides two products that were derived from the recently published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis 1-degree terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs (Gridded 1-deg Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et al., 2013). The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and processing procedures of these two data products.

This proposal aims at developing broadband reflecting mirror coatings with high performance that could&nbsp;be used on the primiary mirror of LUVOIR in order to enable wavelength coverage from the infrared and down to the Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) spectral regions.&nbsp;Improved reflective coatings for optics, particularly in the FUV region (90-120 nm), could yield dramatically more sensitive instruments and permit more instrument design freedom.&nbsp;The coating performance developed through this work will be evaluated both theoretically and experimentally in the context of meeting requirements for exoplanet research.</p><p>Pure Aluminum exhibits a high reflectance over the proposed spectral range of the LUVOIR observatory (90-5000 nm). However, the Al has to be protected from the naturally occurring Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> oxide layer (when exposed to oxygen) with a thin film of a transparent material for use below 130 nm. Aluminum protected with fluorides such as LiF or MgF<sub>2</sub> have been the most commonly used solutions [4]. But below 102 nm down to 90 nm, no transparent material is available to protect Al and coating mirror reflectance stays well below 30%. But even above 102 nm, the reflectance of protected Al is limited by the residual absorption of the fluoride overcoats and the hygroscopic nature of the LiF overcoat.&nbsp; The low reflectivity of coatings in the Lyman Ultraviolet (LUV) range of 90-130 nm is one of the biggest constraints on FUV telescope and spectrograph design, and it limits the science return of FUV-sensitive space missions. In fact, to achieve high-reflectance in broadband coatings has been identified as an &ldquo;Essential Goal&rdquo; in the technology needs for the LUVOIR) surveyor observatory. Improved reflective coatings for optics, particularly in the LUV spectrum, could yield dramatically more sensitive instruments and permit more instrument design freedom. Furthermore, investigations in improving reflectance performance of coatings in this region has the potential to offer unprecedented return on investment given that the LUV contains the highest density of line observations in the UVVIS-IR spectrum.&nbsp;</p>* [Advanced Manufacturing Technologies for Miniaturized Instruments](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w4nu-n7wz) - <p>We will design and construct miniaturized instruments ideal for CubeSat/SmallSat and other planetary missions that are optimized for throughput while addressing fundamental limitations of miniaturization of instruments that are imposed by precision and fastener issues.&nbsp;</p>* [Habitat Particle Impact Monitoring System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jze4-mhd4) - <p>The purpose of this project is the development of particle impact detection technology for application to habitable space exploration modules, both in space and on the surfaces of Solar System bodies. This mission-enabling technology will be needed to improve the safety of future human exploration missions. Inflatable space structures have unique characteristics that would benefit from an instrument system for detecting impact penetrations and reporting the extent of these penetrations, as well as their size and location.  Building on previous experience, (i.e. the Habitat Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) hardware and software, which was developed for the Habitat Demonstration Unit) a system particularly adapted to the multilayer inflatable space structures can be developed.   The HIMS sensors represent a class of sensors that are both low mass, simply emplaced, and require little power or system resources.  This sensor system was applied to test sample coupons, representative of inflatable structures, modified as required, and subjected to hypervelocity impacts. Results of these tests allowed system verification for this type of space structure, with the ultimate goal to achieve an automatic impact location and characterization system for the inflatable space structure.<p/><p>The goal of the Habitat particle Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) is to develop a fully automated, end-to-end particle impact detection system for crewed space exploration modules, both in space and on planetary surfaces.  When micrometeoroids or orbital debris impacts occur on a space habitat, crew members need to be quickly informed of the likely extent of damage, and then take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the mission. HIMS uses multiple thin film piezo-polymer vibration sensors to detect impacts on a surface and characterize the impact locations and degree of penetration.  Installation of the HIMS sensors is easy, and does not require any major reconfiguration of the habitat structure. The detection capabilities of HIMS on a hard-shell structure were successfully demonstrated on the Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) Pressurized Excursion Module (PEM) during the 2010-2011 Desert Research and Technology Studies campaign. The main objective for the project in FY12 was to explore the feasibility of using HIMS for particle impact detection on multi-layer inflatable structures and determine optimum sensor configuration requirements for potential applications on future inflatable habitats. Hypervelocity impact tests were performed on a test article consisting of a spherical rubber bladder inflated within a Kevlar envelope "restraint layer". The tests showed that the system detects the impact in both the Kevlar layer and the rubber bladder.  The ring-down acoustic response of the simplified target indicates a signal detection range of at least 3 m from the point of impact.  It is hypothesized that an actual inflatable structure, with higher stiffness and thicker walls, would propagate the acoustical signals with less loss. Thus the system design and sensor configuration for inflatable structures is expected to be similar to designs and configurations already tested on rigid structures.</p>* [Graphene Field Effect Transistors for Radiation Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fwcs-3623) - <p>This is  propose to develop Graphene Field Effect Transistor based Radiation Sensors (GFET-RS) for NASA Manned Spaceflight Missions anticipated in next several decades.<p/><p>The device consists of a graphene piece deposited on a Si substrate with certain thickness of insulation layer. In our initial experiment, constant radiation was applied above the GFET and device conductance was measured before and after the radiation. We observed an increase of the device mobility (transconductance) after the radiation. This demonstration showed that graphene is radiation hard and its conductance changes with radiation. With the IRAD fund, we will continue exploring sensing mechanisms in GFETs and identify optimal absorber substrates and device geometries to improve radiation detection speed, sensitivity, and energy resolution of our GFET-RS devices.</p>* [Accelerating Memory-Access-Limited HPC Applications via Novel Fast Data Compression, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gi56-xesv) - A fast-paced continual increase on the ratio of CPU to memory speed feeds an exponentially growing limitation for extracting performance from HPC systems. Breaking this memory wall is one of the most important challenges that the HPC community faces today. In Phase I we introduced aggressive innovations enable the injection of unprecedented acceleration into vast classes of memory-access-bound HPC codes via ultra-fast software-based data compression. Groundbreaking speedup on a fully functional NPBCG prototype was delivered to NASA, thus validating the tremendous potential of our approach. The proposed approach is based on a revolutionary theory of compression spearheaded by Accelogic (Compressive Computing), which is able to provide enormous compressive gains for the typical floating point data of HPC applications. 
In Phase II we will build on our success with the NPBCG benchmark, and move boldly into tackling the acceleration of a real-life high-profile code, namely NASA's Cart3D, improving its performance by a paradigm-shifting 2x to 4x end-to-end wall-clock time acceleration by the end of Phase II. Our firm has accumulated crucial know-how and has synthesized its expertise into a powerful industrial-quality process for software acceleration that will be used to ensure success on completing Phase II objectives. In Phase II we also plan on injecting a second NASA code with basic Compressive Computing techniques, and providing it with base levels of acceleration of ~1.3-2x. We will choose this second code from a pool of high-profile codes that have already signed up as early adopters for this project: FUN3D, USM3D, Enzo, and WRF. The work on a second NASA code will also serve as the ultimate field test of the broadness and ease-of-infusion of the proposed technology.
We have secured complementary funds in the amount of $500,000 to increase resources and ensure that the proposed Phase II proposed will be successfully accomplished.* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/45wt-h3qq) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. (2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This data set is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [SAFARI 2000 Daily Rainfall Estimates, 0.1-Deg, Southern Africa, 1993-2001](https://data.nasa.gov/d/46m8-5peb) - The Microwave InfraRed Algorithm (MIRA) is used to produce an imagery data set of daily mean rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution over southern Africa for the period 1993-2001. MIRA combines passive microwave (PMW) from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) on board the DMSP F10 and F14 satellites at a resolution of 0.5 degrees and infrared (IR) data from the Meteosat 4, 5, 6, and 7 satellites in 2-hour slots at a resolution of 5 km. This approach accounts for the limitations of both data types in estimating precipitation. Rainfall estimates are produced at the high spatial and temporal frequency of the IR data using rainfall information from the PMW data. An IR/rain rate relationship, variable in space and time, is derived from coincident observations of IR and PMW rain rate (accumulated over a calibration domain) using the probability matching method. The IR/rain rate relationship is then applied to IR imagery at full temporal resolution. The results presented here are the daily means of those derived rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution.The rainfall data sets are flat binary images with no headers. They are compressed band sequential (bsq) files that contain all of the daily images for the given year. Each image is an array of 401 lines, each with 341 binary floating-point numbers, containing rainfall at 0.1 degree resolution for the area 10 to 50 degrees longitude and 0 to -34 degrees latitude.

Ground measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) were made using the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer and Sunfleck PAR ceptometer, respectively, during focused periods from August 20 to August 28, 2000 at a dry grassland site adjacent to the Sua Pan. The 1 km by 1 km sampling grid was a homogeneous, relatively dense grassland, with a height of 20-100 cm and two prevalent grass types, Odyssea paucinervis and Sporobolus spicatus. Associated reflectance measurements were made with the PARABOLA and ASD instruments (Helmlinger et al., 2004a; 2004b).The data files contain measurements of LAI and PAR reflectance and transmission and a description of sky conditions during the sampling periods. With one exception, all measurements were made under clear sky conditions.  PAR data were measured only on the transect scale while LAI are provided at both pixel and transect scales. PAR readings were performed at 93 transect sample points, and LAI readings were performed at 135 (93 transect and 42 subgrid) sample points. Each file also contains mean LAI and PAR values. The data files are ASCII tables, in comma-separated-value format.* [Next Generation Microshutter Arrays Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f85i-p44p) - We propose to develop the next generation MicroShutter Array (MSA) as a multi-object field selector for missions anticipated in the next two decades. For many applications, this field selector improves instrument efficiency proportionally to the number of shutters opened simultaneously. We have successfully developed and built the JWST microshutter array system, which increases the observing efficiency of the Near Infrared Spectrometer by two orders of magnitude. As a result of this development, there is a significant scientific demand for these devices for space-based and ground based applications. The availability of large format microshutters can significantly increase the scientific reach of spectroscopic survey instrument such as WFIRST and future missions such as ATLAST. The basic design of the JWST MSA cannot be extended to such a large scales due to the design limitations set by the required magnetic actuation. We have recently demonstrated shutter operation using DC plus AC resonant pumping. The breakthrough demonstrates that we are able to eliminate bulky permanent magnets used for JWST MSA actuation, thus opening an avenue to create a very large focal plane field selector that can be built at much lower cost. in this program, we will fabricate electrostatically actuated microshutter arrays and demonstrate their performance for use as UV, visible, and infrared field selectors.* [MOPITT CO gridded daily means (Near and Thermal Infrared Radiances) V007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u82y-6yzg) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals.

Three approaches are combined to develop a system that will meet current and future NASA needs and exceed currently available power processor unit (PPU) performance in terms of electrical efficiency, specific mass (kg/kW), and cost.   The approaches include the use of (a) high-efficiency, 3-phase, dc-dc converters to minimize cooling requirements, mass, and parts count and maximize reliability and efficiency, (b) modularized and standardized sub-system design and fabrication techniques to accommodate power output scaling and re-configuration for specific ion thruster designs without the need to re-qualify hardware, and (c) attention to cost and manufacturability issues that will allow the implementation of electric propulsion systems on future NASA missions without the hidden costs of "hard-to-build" and "hard-to-scale" designs that are currently available.

The initial submission from IKI by Dyachkov was in GROUP FITS (binary) for the 'imaging channel'. A separate submission came through the IHW Infrared Studies Discipline and also contained data presented in the FITS format (IHW keywords) for the two 'infrared channels'. In the former case, the three Pvalues carried information on the distance and two angles used to locate the position of the comet on the slit. The other simple keyword values marked only the date, mission, and experiment. The latter data, had not only 101 individual spectra for the 3-5 micron measurements but a composite 'final' 6-12 micron spectrum with associated 'figure 7' from the published results (COMBES, M. et al. 1988, Icarus, 76, 404). For these 101 spectra a cometo-centric distance was quoted rather than a time micron data. Using this information, the distance range was 270534.9 to 39273.22 km. From this comparison, it is inferred that the distance quoted in the IKI submission is also cometo-centric (31596.0 to 16092 km).* [Use of NDE Techniques for Compliance Verification of Suspect Counterfeit EEE Parts](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cz6c-tcsd) - <p>Genuine microelectronics components are critical to NASA for Human Rating Requirement (HRR) for Manned Follow-On Vehicles and for planetary missions.&nbsp; Counterfeited electrical components could cause failure resulting in loss of mission or, in the case of manned missions, loss of life.&nbsp; There exists a wide variation of fraudulent/counterfeit electronic components due to the various types of components and their packaging construction.&nbsp; Currently, there exists no single standard inspection test to detect suspect fraudulent/counterfeit parts or to verify component integrity.&nbsp;This task&nbsp;identifies and/or develops nondestructive evaluation methods that can be used by NASA Centers and their suppliers to mitigate the risk of fraudulent/counterfeit electronic parts.&nbsp; The methods will first be implemented by the distributor or their test provider or during the incoming receiving inspection process at the Center.&nbsp; In addition, the methods will be used as a control of in-process (post acceptance) and in-service investigations of suspect fraudulent/counterfeit parts.&nbsp; This will purge NASA hardware of such non-conforming parts and thus increase safety and mission success.</p> <p><strong>Specific inspection issue being addressed and history of inspection problems.</strong><br />Genuine microelectronics components are critical to NASA for Human Rating Requirement (HRR) for Manned Follow-On Vehicles and for planetary missions.&nbsp; Counterfeited electrical components could cause failure resulting in loss of mission or, in the case of manned missions, loss of life.&nbsp; There exists a wide variation of fraudulent/counterfeit electronic components due to the various types of components and their packaging construction.&nbsp; The following examples of suspect counterfeit electronic components in recent Government-Industry Data Exchange Program reports demonstrate this variety:</p><p>Currently, there exists no single standard inspection test to detect suspect fraudulent/counterfeit parts or to verify component integrity.&nbsp; Although loosely used, this process is not called authentication because the term &quot;authentication&quot; is reserved for a process conducted by the original component manufacturer.&nbsp; The original component manufacturer owns the intellectual property and the original test hardware and software used in the original manufacturing of the component.&nbsp; However, once the parts enter the supply chain, the manufacturer will never retest the parts.&nbsp; Testing conducted by distributors or by independent third party test service providers is called &quot;product verification&quot;.&nbsp; Industry product verification in the supply chain must then be conducted as a series of nondestructive and destructive tests because counterfeiters of electronic parts continue to evolve their methods to mask evidence of remarking or resurfacing.&nbsp; Most recent counterfeiters are now assembling used parts, with unknown history and reliability issues, into new packages that have no evidence or remarking or resurfacing.&nbsp; These practices force the user or test service providers to continually upgrade product verification methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Details on how completion of this task will increase safety and mission assurance.</strong><br />It is the intention of this task to identify and/or develop nondestructive evaluation methods that can be used by NASA Centers and their suppliers to mitigate the risk of fraudulent/counterfeit electronic parts.&nbsp; The methods will first be implemented by the distributor or their test provider or during the incoming receiving inspection process at the Center.&nbsp; In addition, the methods will be used as a control of in-process (post acceptance) and in-service investigations of suspect fraudulent/counterfeit parts.&nbsp; This will purge NASA hardware of such non-conforming parts and thus increase safety and mission success.</p><p>Details* [Innovative Development of Kernel-Based Reduced-Order Models for Predicting LCO Onset, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g8i2-i62i) - Reducing uncertainty in the prediction of limit cycle oscillations (LCO) and other nonlinear aeroservoelastic phenomena is critical to flight safety.  To do so requires nonlinear methods.  First-principles based methods (CFD/CSD) have made considerable progress but still cannot predict LCO from the outset.  NEAR proposes the development of two innovative nonlinear data-based methods to characterize aeroservoelastic systems using flight-test data.  The proposed methods provide a natural extension of existing linear methods, provide uncertainty estimates of the prediction, and are applicable to flight-test data.  Both approaches are formally related.  However, their practical implementations place various limitations on the physics they represent.  The Phase I effort will document, on a benchmark test case, the advantages and disadvantages of each method.  Phase II will further develop the most promising approach and demonstrate its use on flight-test data, such as data from the F18-AAW.  Special emphasis will be placed on the problem of data generalization across flight conditions, which is key to ensuring safe and efficient envelope-expansion flight testing.* [The Case for Software Health Management](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a5ij-6vyn) - Software Health Management (SWHM) is a new field that is concerned with the development of tools and technologies to enable automated detection, diagnosis, prediction, and mitigation of adverse events due to software anomalies.
Significant effort has been expended in the last several decades in the
development of verification and validation methods for software
intensive systems, but it is becoming increasingly more apparent that this is
not enough to guarantee that a complex software system
meets all safety and reliability requirements. 

Modern software systems can exhibit a variety of failure modes which can go undetected in a verification and validation process.  While standard techniques for error handling, fault detection and isolation
can have significant benefits for many systems, it is becoming increasingly evident that new technologies and methods are necessary for the development of techniques to detect, diagnose, predict, and then mitigate the adverse events due to software that has already undergone significant verification and validation procedures.
These software faults often arise due to the interaction between the software
and the operating environment.
Unanticipated environmental changes lead to software anomalies that may have significant impact on the overall success of the mission.
Because software is ubiquitous, it is not sufficient that errors are
detected only after they occur. Rather, software must be instrumented and
monitored for failures before they happen.
This prognostic capability will yield safer and more dependable systems for the future.  This paper addresses the motivation, needs, and requirements of software health management as a new discipline.

It is not just a matter of stereo being better than 2D, but of stereo being necessary to interpret representations of complex data sets, physical phenomena, engineering designs and position in space.  The US Air Force has long recognized the potential for 3D displays in the cockpit but until now the limitations of 3D display technology have prevented implementation.  Interest in 3D image display has recently surfaced among SPAWAR and among agencies who use helicopters and firms that make camera systems for helicopters for use in power line inspection, law enforcement, and military applications. There is also interest in the use of plane mounted cameras in collision avoidance while taxiing on runways, where 3D display may be of benefit because it can show the pilot how much room there is between the plane and obstacles. 3D displays for these applications must be of the glasses free type, but current embodiments of such displays possess extremely low resolution, produce visual artifacts, and tend to produce very narrow viewing areas.  Under a recent DOE SBIR Phase II contract DTI developed a new glasses free 2D/3D switchable display that avoids the resolution loss, visual artifacts, and viewing restrictions associated with all other autostereoscopic displays, providing full HD resolution in 3D as well as in a 2D viewing mode.  DTI's believes that this new technology can lead to the first practical implementation of a 3D display in the cockpit. During this Phase I program DTI will investigate the adaptation of its 2D/3D displays to cockpit displays through compact design, ruggedizing, and the development of mechanical, electronic, computer, and software interfaces to an aircraft system.  This investigation will lead to a high level design and specification for a prototype display that can developed in Phase II and delivered for testing in a cockpit or simulator.* [PowerCube: Integrated Power, Propulsion, and Pointing for CubeSats, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cs23-8in8) - The PowerCube is a 1U CubeSat module that provides integrated propulsion, power, and precision pointing to enable the low-cost CubeSat platform to be used to conduct high-performance missions. The PowerCube concept integrates three innovative component technologies to provide these capabilities:  First, a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) water-electrolysis fuel cell supplies gH2/gO2 to a simple pressure-fed thruster to provide 300 Ns of impulse per 100 mL of water. This approach enables the CubeSat to launch with 'inert' propellant to comply with P-POD limitations on stored energy and then process the water on-orbit into high-Isp fuel. Second, a deployable solar array that stows along the long sides of the CubeSat and deploys in a 'windmill' configuration provides up to 96 W peak. Third, a 3DOF 'carpal-wrist' gimbal, in conjunction with magnetic torque coils, enables sun-tracking of the solar panel, vectoring of the thruster, and precision pointing of payloads. The combination of ample power and water electrolysis will provide up to 6 m/s of delta-V per 90 minute orbit for a 3U CubeSat. Compared to other CubeSat propulsion technologies, the PowerCube thruster will enable more rapid orbital maneuvering and significantly lower contamination issues.  Our Phase I effort developed a detailed baseline design for the PowerCube, and built and tested a proof-of-concept prototype of the water-electrolysis thruster.  The Phase II effort will mature the electrolysis thruster component to the engineering model level, develop and simulate methods for attitude control and precise pointing of both panels and payloads using the gimbal and torque coils, and develop a detailed design for the entire PowerCube module to enable flight validation in follow-on Phase III efforts.* [A Novel Low-cost, Ka-band, High Altitude, Multi-Baseline Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Sensor for Surface Water Ocean Topography, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mmea-gshd) - This proposal presents the Ka-band SWOT Phenomenology Airborne Radar (KaSPAR) to support the surface water ocean topography (SWOT) mission for science and algorithm development and calibration and validation.

The concept of Cryogenic Hydrogen Radiation Shielding (CHRS) was studied by&nbsp;Cryogenic Branch at NASA GSFC&nbsp;with a FY08 IRAD. This IRAD project will complete a preliminary thermal and ground cooling system design of the CHRS system and also perform a radiation transmission test with potential CHRS tank materials.</p> <p>The objectives of this IRAD study are to perform the preliminary thermal system design and optimization of the CHRS system and to perform radiation testings of samples of materials that are candidates for containing the hydrogen in the CHRS.</p><p>The previous study of the concept proposed a potential CHRS geometry. We can meet the thermal design&nbsp;requirements by using proper cryogenic thermal management techniques. Various design&nbsp;options will be investigated for the fluid management system.

We will use a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis tool ANSYS FLUENT&reg; to analyze and optimize the performance of the fluid management system.</p><p>In addition to the work above, the tank materials will be selected based on the thermal performance. The radiation test for these materials will be carried out at NASA Center for Radiation Engineering and Science for Space Exploration (CRESSE).</p><p>This FY 2014 IRAD study will increase the CHRS TRL level to 2. The design will prove the concept and increase the feasibility of the CHRS system. &nbsp;The output from this study can be used to pursue research opportunities for the radiation shielding at NASA&rsquo;s Human Research Program (HRP).</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Justification</strong></p><p>Human susceptibility to the harsh space radiation environment has been identified as being a major hurdle for exploration beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). High energy protons and nuclei ions from Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) can result in radiation doses that are dangerous to astronaut health and even survivability if the astronauts are not adequately shielded. The high energy particles also cause significant amounts of secondary radiation when they impinge on Aluminum, which is commonly used for spacecraft structure. The secondary neutron radiation may cause human radiogenic cancers. Hydrogen or hydrogen rich materials are ideal materials for radiation shielding because of hydrogen does not easily break down to form secondary radiation source.</p><p>A &nbsp;CHRS concept study was conducted by the Cryogenics and Fluids Branch in FY08. The results showed the most mass effective material for protecting a spacecraft if proper design is implemented. The performance of three candidate materials was studied in a LaRC study.&nbsp;</p>* [Visualization in Real-Time Experiment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3sj9-yb5x) - <p>With the increase in quantity and complexity of launches at the Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) there is an ever-growing need for a more capable real-time visualization system for the WFF Range Control Center (RCC).&nbsp; This system should have the ability to depict the vehicle using actual CAD vehicle models, display vehicle attitude and stage separation events, and utilize robust network protocol suitable for real-time safety applications.&nbsp; This project will use existing WFF hardware systems and leverage past experiences and lessons learned to produce a Visualization in Real-Time Experiment (VIRTEx) application that will use a cutting edge message protocol for lab demonstration and use during real-time operations.</p> <p>The objective of this project will be to migrate some of the outputs from the WFF Mission Planning Lab (MPL) into a real-time visualization system.&nbsp; The MPL is responsible for generating pre-flight RF margin link analysis, mission simulation &amp; visualization, and other products for WFF missions.&nbsp; This real-time visualization system would depict in 3D graphics the position and orientation of the launch vehicle(s) or suborbital carrier (UAV, sounding rocket), VIRTEx would be expanded to use a more flexible publish/subscribe architecture, and the system will leverage recently developed advanced telemetry and data handling systems within the Range network.</p><p>Another main objective will be updating VIRTEx to support a sounding rocket mission which is scheduled to launch from NASA Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) in the summer of 2014.</p><p>This project will also be used to demonstrate the successful attitude data conversion from a WFF telemetry system.&nbsp; Updates are being finished on this telemetry system that convert various NASA Sounding Rocket attitude control systems (ACS) data formats.&nbsp; Multiple ACS systems output different data formats, so libraries and algorithms were added to the telemetry system to convert this data into a standard yaw, pitch, and roll dataset for Range Safety.&nbsp; VIRTEx will be able to easily show this data and will be able to compare it to the pre-flight attitude predictions.</p>* [Extreme Energy Particle Astrophysics with ANITA-V](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xuzj-3cz4) - This is the lead proposal for the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) mission. ANITA seeks to detect and elucidate the sources of the highest energy particles in the universe via measurements of cosmogenic ultra-high energy neutrinos at energies above 1EeV (1EeV=10^18 eV). Such neutrinos are in many cases predicted to be the only unattenuated astrophysical messengers that arrive at Earth with precise directional information, since neutrinos are neutral particles with very weak interactions with matter in intergalactic space. Neutrinos that ANITA seeks to detect will signal the presence of the most extreme astrophysical accelerators and environments, and complement the information available via electromagnetic messengers from gamma-rays to radio waves. 

ANITA uses a long-duration balloon payload equipped with 48 dual-polarization horn antennas to detect radio impulses in the frequency range 200-1200 MHz, within which the properties of cold Antarctic ice include extreme radio-transparency and depths of up to 4 km. If a neutrino interacts anywhere within the ice sheet in ANITA's view from stratospheric altitudes, we can detect the emerging radio impulse and determine its direction and other characteristics with high precision. This in turn allows us to select candidate neutrinos from among the thermal and anthropogenic backgrounds with high confidence, and to derive angular information about the arrival direction of such candidates as well.

Recently ANITA analysis investigated a new detection channel, which focuses on tau-lepton-generating neutrinos, which lead to a unique experimental signature for which ANITA has potentially very high sensitivity, and a candidate event has been detected in prior data. This new detection channel has added to the variety of methods by which ANITA continues to improve its sensitivity and reach into predicted models for cosmogenic neutrinos, for which ANITA has among the best constraints of any detector to date.

ANITA is currently the only active NASA mission with the capability to measure ultra-high energy neutrinos, and ANITA's ultra-high energy neutrino sensitivity while in flight is unmatched by any other instrument, ground- or space-based. As such it is a direct contributor to our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe, through astrophysical messengers that provide unique information about the most extreme and energetic objects in the cosmos.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_realtime](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i568-8mpe) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data.

However, sensors continue to be considered the weak link in many engineering applications since often they are less reli- able than the system they are observing. This is in part due to the sensors’ operating principles and their susceptibility to interference from the environment. Detecting and mitigating sensor failure modes are becoming increasingly important in more complex and safety-critical applications. This paper reports on different techniques for sensor fault detection, disambiguation, and mitigation. It presents an expert system that uses a combination of object-oriented modeling, rules, and semantic networks to deal with the most common sensor faults, such as bias, drift, scaling, and dropout, as well as system faults. The paper also describes a sensor correction module that is based on fault parameters extraction (for bias, drift, and scaling fault modes) as well as utilizing partial redundancy for dropout sensor fault modes). The knowledge-based system was derived from the results obtained in a previously deployed Neural Network (NN) application for fault detection and disambiguation. Results are illustrated on an electromechanical actuator application where the system faults are jam and spalling. In addition to the functions implemented in the previous work, system fault detection under sensor failure was also modeled. The paper includes a sensitivity analysis that compares the results previously obtained with the NN. It concludes with a discussion of similarities and differences between the two approaches and how the knowledge based system provides additional functionality compared to the NN implementation.* [Perovskite-based Photovoltaics: A New Pathway to Ultra- Low-Cost Space Power](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ja3w-xvxg) - We will determine if the lifetime performance of new perovskite-based solar cells can be engineered for long-term performance for space applications.  We will utilize cutting-edge designs for long lifetime, engineer our own samples, and characterize performance throughout standardized lifetime testing appropriate for space technology. 

Thin film solar cells have long held promise as enabling technology for flexible arrays and radiation hardness. The meteoric efficiency rise (reaching 22%1) for new solar cells in the “perovskite” structure family – from now on referred to simply as perovskites2 – represent an exceedingly attractive option for potential space applications. We envision this technology to enable the ubiquity of low-cost smallsats and CubeSats that can be utilized for power-hungry, high fidelity experiments and measurements. Mass production and automated assembly of these systems helps bring down cost and standardizes launch requirements. Additional applications include autonomous, roll-out solar arrays for extra-terrestrial surface deployments.  In these two visions the current state of the art is disrupted by the thin, flexibility of perovskites, their ease of fabrication and high efficiency. 

The goal is  to transfer the perovskite solar cells from research laboratory curiosity to potential game-changing, space qualified technology.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Rapid Clock Product (30 second resolution, daily files, generated daily) from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/759d-57q8) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Rapid Satellite and Receiver Clock Product (30-second granularity, daily files, generated daily) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce GNSS satellite and ground receiver clock values. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS rapid combined satellite and receiver clock products. The rapid combination is a daily solution available approximately 17 hours after the end of the previous UTC day. All satellite and receiver clock solution files utilize the clock RINEX format and span 24 hours from 00:00 to 23:45 UTC.

The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS ultra-rapid combined orbit products. The ultra-rapid orbit and clock combination is a sub-daily solution, released four times per day, at 03:00, 09:00, 15:00, and 21:00 UTC (prior to GPS week 1267 they were released twice daily). In this way the average age of the predictions is reduced to 6 hours (compared to 36 hours for the old IGS predicted products and 9 hours for the twice-daily ultra-rapid solutions). IGS ultra-rapid orbit files contain 48 hours of tabulated orbital ephemerides, and the start/stop epochs continuously shift by 6 hours with each update. The first 24 hours of each IGS ultra-rapid orbit are based on the most recent GNSS observational data from the IGS hourly tracking network. At the time of release, the observed orbits have an initial latency of 3 hours. The next 24 hours of each file are predicted orbits, extrapolated from the observed orbits. The orbits within each ultra-rapid product file are, however, continuous at the boundary between the observed and predicted parts. Normally, the predicted orbits between 3 and 9 hours into the second half of each ultra-rapid orbit file are most relevant for true real time applications. All orbit solution files utilize the extended standard product-3 (SP3c) format. The reduced latency on availability of these products allows for significantly improved orbit predictions and reduced errors for user applications.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Ultra-Rapid Orbit/Clock/ERP Product Summary from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qhxj-6gm5) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Rapid Orbit/Reference Frame Product Summary from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as collateral damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass high charge and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs) but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5-24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response although they differ slightly in the timing degree and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the  xd2DSB response xd3 were also induced by other DNA damaging agents but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced at 24 h post-irradiation ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast only HZE-irradiated plants at 1.5 h after irradiation exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response shared with plants experiencing extended night. This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants. We treated 5-day-old WT and atm-1 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana with 100 Gy of Gamma radiation (over a span of 15 minutes) or 30 Gy of HZE (over a span of approximately 12 minutes). Gamma irradiations were completed at 8:40 am while HZE irradiations were conducted in two runs (due to space limitations) which were completed at 1:09 and 1:28pm respectively. Gamma treated seedlings were sampled at 10:10 am 11:40 am 2:55 pm 8:40 pm and 8:40 am. HZE treated seedlings were sampled at 2:39 pm 4:09 pm 7:24 pm 1:09 am and 1:09 pm. Un-irradiated WT and atm-1 control seedlings were sampled at 10:45 am on Day #1 and 9:15 am on Day #2. There are a total of 22 experimental or control conditions with two replicates per condition yielding 44 samples overall.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_final](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tetj-ga5h) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites. These orbits are determined sub-daily (ultra-rapid generation), daily (rapid generation), and weekly (final IGS product). The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator retrieves these individual solutions and generates the official IGS combined orbit products. The orbits generated by the individual ACs and the combination products generated by the ACCs are available at the CDDIS. These orbits can be used to determine precise coordinates of the observing stations, gravity field parameters, and Earth orientation parameters. The IGS Final products are the basis for the IGS reference frame and are intended for those applications demanding high consistency and quality.* [Conformable Thermoelectric Device for Waste Heat Scavenging in Space Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i93j-prus) - NASA space exploration missions stand to benefit from reliable means to
conserve energy that is otherwise given off as waste heat.
Thermoelectric generators have demonstrated the potential for scavenging
waste heat energy, yet are still limited by technical and geometrical
boundaries that must be overcome for long term reliability in
applications such as interplanetary missions. To address these
limitations, Nanohmics Inc. and Professor Kevin Stokes at the University
of New Orleans propose to fabricate conformable thermoelectric
generators for long-term radiation resistance in space applications. The
proposed device will incorporate thermoelectric p- and n-doped high ZT
thermoelectric legs that aredeposited onto a substrate.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_rapid](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8hjw-ydt4) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data.

Optical instrumentation, such as optical spectrometers would provide benchmark data for fundamental flow, radiation, and materials modeling as well as provide operational correlations between vehicle reentry drag and radiation if implemented in a TPS flight test program.  Without flight spectral data, and the appropriate modeling efforts, the power of prediction to assist in new heat shield design does not exist for reentry into other planetary atmospheres.  This is a severe limitation for future space exploration missions which FiberPlug helps address.* [Lenslet-Array, Spatially-Distributed, Self-Phase-Locked Laser Architecture](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q9ck-9su5) - <p>We are developing a novel laser technology to enable coherent beam combination from distributed gain sources.&nbsp; This addresses the most important limitations in laser technology: efficiency, power scaling and wavelength selectivity.</p> <p>Our goal is to demonstrate a proof-of-concept laser technology that will enable power-scaling using multiple distributed gain sources.&nbsp; We will design, build and characterize a prototype laser distributed elements to demonstrate the concept.&nbsp; This architecture will be widely applicable to almost any laser technology but will have particular benefits for fiber and semiconductor gain media where power scaling is difficult.</p>* [Titan Montgolfiere Terrestrial Test Bed, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/53cf-5a8c) - With the Titan Saturn System Mission, NASA is proposing to send a Montgolfiere balloon to probe the atmosphere of Titan.  To better plan this mission and create a robust optimized balloon design, NASA requires the ability to more accurately evaluate the convective heat transfer characteristics of the balloon operating in Titan's atmosphere.  Based on limitations of previous efforts, NASA has requested proposals for a testbed to support CFD validation.  Leveraging the results of the Phase I effort, Near Space Corporation (NSC), proposes to develop and operate two full scale Testbeds (~9 m diameter) in order to help validate CFD models for the TSSM Titan Montgolfiere balloon.  The Testbeds will incorporate new envelope design innovations and state-of-the-art data acquisition methods to enable data intensive tethered and free-flight tests.  Utilizing its unique balloon facility located in a large blimp hangar, NSC will conduct iterative tethered hangar tests of the full scale Testbeds (which is not possible in existing cryogenic test chambers). These flights will enable better IR imaging and flow characterization measurements.  The acquired data will provide critical input to incrementally improve and validate the CFD models.  The outdoor drop/inflation test and a free flight test will retire technology risks associated with the future Titan mission in addition to generating the validation data necessary to improve the existing CFD models.  NSC proposes to develop and operate a mature TMTT system during Phase II, generate pertinent data that will be used to improve the CFD models, and leverage the effort to create valuable technology with both NASA and non-NASA commercial applications.* [MOPITT CO gridded monthly means (Thermal Infrared Radiances) V007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s9qp-3y8i) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals.

The threat of onboard fire is constant and requires early, fast and unfailing detection.  Current fire detectors are prone to fatigue and have insufficient sensitivity, selectivity and time-response.  Smoke detectors cannot detect early stages of combustion and become unreliable if exposed to dust particulates.  New sensor technology is required to face the challenging tasks associated with future space exploration involving missions to the Moon and Mars.  Carbon monoxide formation is a reliable indicator of evolving fire threats onboard spacecraft and this gaseous combustion product allows rapid early detection.  Vista Photonics proposes to evaluate and implement emerging infrared light sources for high-performance optical CO detection.  Optical sensors are particularly favorable due to unique features like fast response, high precision and strong species selectivity.  Design criteria such as small footprint, low weight, low power consumption as well as internal calibration and continuous sensor health monitoring will be implemented to provide a spaceflight optimized sensor.  The proposed optical absorption approach uses modulation techniques together with a compact path length enhancing cell with a small sample volume.* [Radiation Hard Space Wire Gigabit Ethernet Compatible Transponder, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ufwa-ir3v) - Current and future programs of near-Earth and deep space exploration performed by NASA and Department of Defense require the development of reconfigurable, high-speed intra-satellite interconnect systems based on switching fabric active backplane architecture with high-speed serial interfaces. Electrical and/or optical transponders operating with Space Wire, Fire Wire, or Gigabit Ethernet protocols are required to support the associated data interconnects. The systems must be easily upgradeable, power-efficient, fault-tolerant, EMI-protected, and capable to operate effectively for long periods of time in harsh environmental conditions including radiation effects. To address the described needs, Advanced Science and Novel Technology Company proposes to develop a basic concept of the novel, optical, radiation-tolerant transponder, which will be implemented as a hermetically-sealed pigtailed multi-chip module with an FPGA-friendly parallel interface and will feature an improved radiation tolerance, high data rate, low power consumption, and advanced functionality. The transponder will utilize the company's patent-pending current-mode logic library of radiation-hardened-by-architecture cells. 8B10B encoding will be used to achieve data disparity equal to 0 and perform a reliable clock recovery. The encoder and decoder will utilize the company's patented half-rate architecture that improves radiation tolerance. The proposed characteristics will be achieved by utilization of an advanced SiGe BiCMOS technology.* [Advanced Materials for Safe, High Performance Space-Rated Lithium-Ion Batteries, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qqhv-7dvd) - NASA space exploration vehicles are trending to higher pulse power, energy capacity levels and cycle life in order to meet exponentially increasing performance and lifespan requirements. As the demand for on-board power and total energy-storage capacity has continued to increase, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of battery technologies with higher energy- and power-density potential. Although substantial advancements have been made in this class of batteries over the past ten years by both domestic and foreign suppliers, substantial limitations still exist in: energy and power densities, operational temperature limits, safety, and lifecycle and lifetime performance.  To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc. proposes the use of advanced nanocomoposite electrodes and ionic liquid electrolytes to enable increased performance and safety in lithium-ion batteries as compared to state-of-the-art devices.  The high capacity, high rate capability and high cycle life performance potential of the proposed advanced nanocomposite electrodes in combination with the inherent non-volatility and non-flammability of ionic liquids holds substantial potential in meeting this objective.  This proposed project will result in improved specific energy and power, wider operation temperature ranges, inherently safer operation, and excellent storage / cycle life as compared to current Li-ion batteries.* [SPHERES Autonomy and Identification Testbed, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8w4m-gg9c) - Many future space missions involve formation flying spacecraft performing imaging, inspection, assembly, and servicing missions.  Having multiple spacecraft in close proximity undergoing comparatively rapid maneuvers dramatically changes the nature of safe modes.  No longer can a spacecraft just null its rates, point its arrays towards the Sun and phone home.  Now, the faulty spacecraft must also ensure that it will not collide with others.  Furthermore, it must plan its maneuvers such that if it does experience a fault, the likelihood of collision is minimized.  Fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) is more complex and requires a vigilant on-board software watchdog that reacts to both intra-vehicle as well as inter-vehicle faults and plans according to the consequences. Payload Systems Inc. (PSI), along with it partners at MIT and Intellization, propose an Autonomy and Identification Testbed (SPHERES-AIT) based on the SPHERES platform.  SPHERES is a multi-satellite docking laboratory to mature metrology, autonomy, and path-planning algorithms for AR&D in the risk-tolerant yet long duration micro-gravity inside the International Space Station (ISS). This work will mature a modular autonomy software architecture that supports  on-orbit self-assembly and spacecraft formation flight using a coordinated terrestrial and ISS laboratory that supports spiral development.* [Novel Wick Structures for Improved Heat Pipe Performance, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rsuh-hkmd) - Heat pipes are commonly used for transporting heat over relatively long distances with very low temperature drop.  One of the limitations of heat pipes is the capillary limit, which states that the sum of pressure drops of the working fluid cannot exceed the capillary head developed by the wick.  Since most of the working fluid pressure drop is incurred in flow through the wick, it is important to reduce the wick resistance as much as possible while still being able to transport the required thermal load. 
All heat pipes made today have the same wick throughout the heat pipe.  This facilitates manufacture, however it causes a great deal more resistance to liquid flow than is minimally required.  By breaking the wick up into several different regions in which the wick properties are different, a more optimal stepwise wick is proposed.  Preliminary calculations done by the PI indicate that the capillary limit of a heat pipe can be increased by a factor of 2x to 3.5x, depending on the number of discrete steps the wick is divided into.   The proposed program aims to demonstrate the improvement in capillary limit experimentally.* [Novel Fabrication of Nano Device for Single DNA/Protein Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gmtw-e8ur) - The health of the astronauts during space flight is critical to the success of NASA?s space program.  Astronauts are exposed to tremendous environmental challenges, such as cosmic radiation, microgravity and confined space.  Their immune systems are easily compromised.  To study these effects, biomarkers such as nucleic acids and protein are measured to determine how the body reacts and adjusts to the stresses.  Current detection methods rely on traditional molecular techniques that are time-consuming and require skillful operators.  Also, the equipment needed is bulky and require high-power consumption.  Therefore, many measurements are not conducted near real time but are completed after the samples are frozen and returned to earth.  This leads to uncertainty on the reliability of the data.  In order to overcome these problems, Lynntech proposes a novel method to fabrication a nano-electronic biochip that potentially can provide single DNA/protein detection in near real time.  The proposed biochip will be more sensitive, smaller, more reliable, lower cost, and easier to operate for NASA?s mission than the most commonly used optical methods.  The ultimate goal is to develop a small real-time nucleic acid and protein detection biochip capable of conducting measurements for long duration space missions.* [CH3D ICE ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ieqz-cmuv) - This data set is the result of laboratory transmission spectroscopy experiments performed within a sealed cell in the ice laboratory at Northern Arizona University. We record spectra at wavelengths from 1 to 6 microns to study CH3D bands at 2.47, 2.87, and 4.56 microns (as indicated by '25', '29' and '45' in the data file names). We report temperature-dependent absorption coefficients of these bands when the CH3D is diluted in CH4 ice and also when it is dissolved in N2 ice. These absorption coefficient spectra can be combined with data from the literature to simulate arbitrary D/H ratio absorption coefficients for CH4 ice and for CH4 in N2 ice. The data were originally published in 2011 in Icarus, vol. 212, pp. 941-949, and that paper should be consulted for details about laboratory procedures and limitations of the data.* [Chronic Telemetric Biofluid Flow Monitoring Device, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cgn9-betp) - Chronic Telemetric Biofluid Flow Monitoring Device, Phase I* [Three Dimensional Volumetric Terahertz Scanning for Aerospace Non Destructive Evaluation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c9u8-tt6k) - In this Phase I STTR project, we propose to develop the critical innovations necessary for a high speed three dimesnional terahertz (THz) tomographic imaging system for aerospace non destructive evaluation (NDE) applcations.  NASA and the Aerospace industry are beginning to utilize THz reflection imaging (for example, examining the space shuttle external tank sprayed on foam insulation for voids and disbonds).  THz NDE imaging is widely applicable to composite resin, ceramic, plastic, natural, and other non-metallic materials.  Current commercial equipment is capable of  two dimensional raster scanning.  The wider utility of THz NDE technology can be more fully exploited for the development of NASA and aerospace applications if the full potential for high speed three dimensional THz imaging is realized.  The current state of the art equipment collects the THz waveform reflection from a very narrow depth range from a strongly reflective backing.  The proposed innovations will increase the dynamic range of the THz waveform acquisition to allow collection of reflections from weaker interfaces, and will increase the window of high speed scanning of the THz waveform to allow three dimensional images to be reconstructed for objects many inches thick.* [Tissue-Equivalent Radiation Dosimeter-On-A-Chip, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vu7n-hh22) - Many commercially available digital dosimeters are bulky and are unable to properly measure dose for space radiation.  The complexity of space flight design requires reliable, fault-tolerant equipment with the capability of providing real-time dose readings during a mission, which is not feasible with the existing thermo-luminescent dosimeter (TLD) technology.  
The project will create a compact, lightweight, energy-efficient dose meter comprised of a tissue-equivalent scintillation crystal coupled to a solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM), which is an array of CMOS photodiodes, operated in Geiger avalanche mode.  The ubiquitous nature of CMOS technology provides a standardized development platform, and the ability to integrate all the supporting electronics into a miniature, simple design.  
	In Phase I, we will model the expected dosimeter performance and characterize the performance of a prototype dosimeter exposed to high-energy protons, which simulates radiation in the space environment.  We will also determine the TLD-dose equivalence of our measurements.  In Phase II, we will create the support software and design and fabricate a finalized chip that includes readout electronics, power supply, memory storage, and other interfacing components.* [CNT-Based Smart Electrostatic Filters for Capturing Nanoparticulate Lunar Regolith, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ewtn-bupp) - The abrasive, reactive, and ubiquitous nature of lunar regolith created significant and serious problems during the Apollo moon missions.  In this Phase I, Agave BioSystems, in collaboration with Dr. Randy Vander Wal of the Universities Space Research Association, propose to develop next generation smart filters using novel carbon nanotube (CNT)-based structures in electrostatic devices.  Since CNTs have extremely high surface area, can function without the mass transfer limitations of traditional filtrations systems, and they can be charged to emit very high charge densities, they constitute an ideal material for integration into spacecraft air handling systems as electrostatic filtration components.  The overall goal of this program is to build upon the unique structural and electronic nature of carbon nanotubes to create novel smart filters.  By synthesizing the CNTs in situ on solid mesh supports and integrating them into a novel electrostatic particle collection unit, we aim to create novel filtration media capable of removing airborne lunar regolith from spacecraft airlock and cabin atmospheres.* [High Interactivity Visualization Software for Large Computational Data Sets, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5y48-dmfd) - We propose to develop a collection of computer tools and libraries called SciViz that enable researchers to visualize large scale data sets on HPC resources remotely from their workstations at interactive rates.  The proposed technology will interoperate with common existing scientific visualization software and provide equivalent core functionality optimized for very large data sets. Existing scientific visualization tools have specific limitations for large scale scientific data sets.  Of these four limitations can be seen as paramount: (a) Memory Management, (b) Remote Visualization, (c) Interactivity, and (d) Specificity.  SciViz overcomes these four issues and uses stack oriented approach in order to produce tools that can be more easily and widely adopted with minimal interruption within existing visualization environments. SciViz  will be an open source implementation.* [Advanced Oxidation Technology for Potable Water Disinfection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e6ad-2kmw) - The availability of high-quality potable water is essential in crewed space missions. Closed loop water recycling systems as well as potable water holding tanks and waterlines provide environments for biofilm formation that can facilitate the growth of human pathogens, as well as organisms that can cause deterioration of distribution lines. Prevention requires the maintenance of a chemically stable and biologically effective residual concentration of biocide in water and wetted surfaces of the system. Current disinfection technologies in potable water systems for space applications utilize either iodine or silver biocide. Limitations exist in terms of incompatibility with some disinfection chemistries and surfaces, long-term health risk, rapid biocide depletion, and need for consumable supply and waste disposal. Lynntech proposes to develop an advanced disinfection system for water disinfection and biofilm prevention based on an on-demand biocide generator which does not require consumable chemicals. Excess disinfectant is decomposed on-demand into water and oxygen, representing zero toxicity for crew consumption of potable water. During the Phase I project, the effectiveness of the proposed system for potable water production will be demonstrated. During the Phase II project, an automated system will be developed and delivered to NASA.* [Rotor health monitoring combining spin tests and data-driven anomaly detection methods](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rbn3-kay3) - Health monitoring is highly dependent on sensor systems that are capable of performing in various engine environmental conditions and able to transmit a signal upon a predetermined crack length, while acting in a neutral form upon the overall performance of the engine system. Efforts are under way at NASA Glenn Research Center through support of the Intelligent Vehicle Health Management Project (IVHM) to develop and implement such sensor technology for a wide variety of applications. These efforts are focused on developing high temperature, wireless, low cost, and durable products. In an effort to address technical issues concerning health monitoring, this article considers data collected from an experimental study using high frequency capacitive sensor technology to capture blade tip clearance and tip timing measurements in a rotating turbine engine-like-disk to detect the disk faults and assess its structural integrity. The experimental results composed at a range of rotational speeds from tests conducted at the NASA Glenn Research Center’s Rotordynamics Laboratory are evaluated and integrated into multiple data-driven anomaly detection techniques to identify faults and anomalies in the disk. In summary, this study presents a select evaluation of online health monitoring of a rotating disk using high caliber capacitive sensors and demonstrates the capability of the in-house spin system.* [High Interactivity Visualization Software for Large Computational Data Sets, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ttzp-wtjx) - Existing scientific visualization tools have specific limitations for large scale scientific data sets.  Of these four limitations can be seen as paramount: (i) memory management, (ii) remote visualization, (iii) interactivity, and (iv) specificity.  In Phase I, we proposed and successfully developed a prototype of a collection of computer tools and libraries called SciViz that overcome these limitations and enable researchers to visualize large scale data sets (greater than 200 gigabytes) on HPC resources remotely from their workstations at interactive rates.  A key element of our technology is the stack oriented rather than a framework driven approach which allows it to interoperate with common existing scientific visualization software thereby eliminating the need for the user to switch and learn new software. The result is a versatile 3D visualization capability that will significantly decrease the time to knowledge discovery from large, complex data sets.

Typical visualization activity can be organized into a simple stack of steps that leads to the visualization result.  These steps can broadly be classified into data retrieval, data analysis, visual representation, and rendering.  Our approach will be to continue with the technique selected in Phase I of utilizing existing visualization tools at each point in the visualization stack and to develop specific tools that address the core limitations identified and seamlessly integrate them into the visualization stack.  Specifically, we intend to complete technical objectives in four areas that will complete the development of visualization tools for interactive visualization of very large data sets in each layer of the visualization stack.  These four areas are:  Feature Objectives, C++ Conversion and Optimization, Testing Objectives, and Domain Specifics and Integration.  The technology will be developed and tested at NASA and the San Diego Supercomputer Center.* [Prognostics-Enabled Power Supply for ADAPT Testbed, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u2d7-unwv) - Ridgetop's role is to develop electronic prognostics for sensing power systems in support of NASA/Ames ADAPT testbed. The prognostic enabled power systems from Ridgetop are to be integrated into NASA's Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT) and later used in the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).   Prognostics will provide power supply "state of health", remaining useful life (RUL) and notify operators of impending failures so that load-shedding or orderly switch-overs can be supported.

Using the ADAPT at NASA/Ames Research Center, Ridgetop will design, implement and validate a prototype prognostic sensor that employs both analog circuits and digital logic in a microcontroller unit (MCU) or microproprocessor controller (MPC) to "prognostics-enable" a high efficiency switching power converter.
The ADAPT is a testbed, developed to explore health-management systems in manned spaceflight with three main goals: 1) to assess performance of diagnostic tools and algorithms against a standardized testbed and repeatable failure scenarios, 2) to develop prognostic models (performance degradation, remaining life estimation) for spacecraft subsystems, and 3) prototype Advanced Caution and Warning System (ACAWS) algorithms and user interfaces.  

By developing effective and practical prognostics for a power supply, Ridgetop's role will be to extend the capabilities of the ADAPT testbed.* [Ceramic-Metal Interfaces by Functional Grading, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dwcs-bjbf) - Glacigen Materials proposes a novel technique for producing large-area sheets of functionally graded materials (FGM), which yield robust ceramic-metal interfaces capable of withstanding harsh environments that include high temperatures. Propulsion systems offer some of the harshest possible design conditions from a materials perspective and the demands placed on engineering materials will become more rigorous in future systems. The combination of structural and environmental constraints often dictate that ceramics and metals be used synergistically. Unfortunately, the limitations of ceramic-metal joining are exacerbated in these same environments where simultaneous use of ceramics and metals would be most useful. Large discrepancies in thermal expansion coefficients and near-planar interfaces lead to delamination and spallation even in the best engineered bonds.
     As a novel approach to this problem, Glacigen will create robust C-M interfaces by grading from one material phase to the other through a tailorable thickness. The technique is materials flexible, enjoys exceptional damage tolerance, and can accept significant mismatches in thermal expansion coefficients. The method for producing FGM sheets presented in this proposal will have the added advantage of controlled anisotropic properties within the sheets. In particular, it is anticipated that this new material system will be particularly valued for its damage tolerance at the interface where up to 96% of the interface can be destroyed before contact area is reduced to that of a planar joint with the same footprint. A second point of unique value will lie in the utility of engineered anisotropy where through thickness thermal conductivity is expected to be dramatically higher than in-plane thermal conductivity. Phase I efforts will demonstrate fabrication of these sheets and will include the characterization of mechanical, thermal, and functional properties.* [SMEX03 ALMNet and SCAN Soil Moisture Data: Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7rsh-qm5x) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.

This data set includes soil moisture data collected at crop, pasture, and forested sites located within the Alabama MesoNet (ALMNet) network.* [Rapid In-Place Composite Rotor Damage Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/m2ry-upak) - Luna Innovations is proposing to further develop the Rapid In-Place Composite Rotor Damage Detection (RIPCoRDD) System for determining and tracking the structural health of composite rotorcraft blades and other composite structures. There is a need for accurate, reliable assessments of the condition of composite parts which may have been damaged through impacts, fatigue, or abrasion.  This is especially true for cases in which the  damage may not be visible from the surface. The RIPCoRDD system is designed such that it will enable composite rotor damage detection in seconds with absolutely no increase in weight, power consumption, or volume of the rotorcraft. The core of the RIPCoRDD device is a unique, distributed, high-definition fiber optic strain sensor (HD-FOS) which provides spatially dense strain measurements (every 1.25-2.5 mm) within the composite structure, coupled with a ground based installation of Luna's proven optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) instrumentation.  Commercialization will focus on transitioning the technology first to OEM manufacturers for non-destructive inspection applications, followed by deployment to rotorcraft end users for lifetime monitoring and diagnostics.* [Coded Aperture Techniques for High-Throughput Imaging Spectroscopy, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vet2-zjf8) - We propose the use of programmable, two-dimensional (2D) coded apertures for high-throughput imaging spectroscopy. Spatially-varying, 2D, transmissive or reflective encoded mask, such as a hadamard or bernoulli random matrix, can be leveraged to realize high-throughput variants of many standard imaging spectroscopy techniques with throughput enhancements surpassing 50-100x compared to slit-based systems. In addition, recent advances in fast-switching spatial light modulators enable the reprogramming of mask encoding on the millisecond timescale. The combination these two technologies enables a wide array of potential innovations for hyperspectral imaging systems offering high-throughput, compressive measurement, with significant operational-flexibility. In this proposal, we target the application of these techniques to the development of a high-throughput, pushbroom imaging spectrometer for planetary science applications.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/p7jp-ncu7) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [FLASHRAD: A 3D Rad Hard Memory Module For High Performance Space Computers, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vfb2-e934) - The computing capabilities of onboard spacecraft are a major limiting factor for accomplishing many classes of future missions. Although technology development efforts are underway that will provide improvements to spacecraft central processing units (CPUs) they do not address the limitations of current onboard memory systems. In addition to CPU upgrades, effective execution of data-intensive operations such as terrain relative navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning and scheduling, and onboard science data processing and analysis require high-bandwidth, low-latency memory systems to maximize processor usage (i.e. to overcome the "memory wall").  Copious amounts of data being generated on a mission require large amounts of non-volatile memory storage in order to store this data for transmission back to earth when power to do this operation is available.  Furthermore, the memory system must be capable of providing the necessary operational robustness and fault tolerance required for space applications.  In an effort to support the needs for NASA's High Performance Space Computer (HPSC), it is proposed that this research investigates the challenges and opportunities in developing a space-qualified, 3D Flash memory cube utilizing COTS memory devices supplemented with a custom Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) controller.  Focus would be on developing a NAND Flash memory module that could be used for SSRs to help increase the memory densities, lower power, lower cost and to achieve higher data throughput.* [High Watts per Kilogram - Advanced Integration and Heat Management solar array technology (HaWK-AIHM ), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ere4-hiiu) - Small satellite architectures have become a desirable low cost alternative to larger heritage spacecraft for advanced scientific missions.  Unfortunately, the traditional component make-up of a small satellite or cubesats is for short duration missions and not specifically designed for space environment resiliency. NASA has identified several scientific missions which would benefit from highly engineered, space environment tolerant and high reliability components. MMA Design (MMA) proposes new innovations in small satellite deployable solar arrays for theses missions, specifically targeting high reliability, simple and heritage proven designs, and high performance. • Composite deployable hinge mechanism - due to volumetric constraints and stowed thickness requirements, an innovative composite panel-to-panel hinge mechanism is required. MMA has extensive knowledge in the design, manufacturing and test of composite tape hinges for deployable structures. The challenges that will be addressed in this effort is how to design a composite hinge with a tight stowed radius of curvature and a method of integration to the substrate panels that provides higher thermal conductivity than a traditional clevis hinge. • Advance high stiffness, high-k solar array substrates, multi-functional - limitations with traditional polyimide or glass-fiber substrates is that they exhibit low stiffness and thermal conductivity properties. Alternatively, High-K Mesophase-pitch based graphite fibers would provide magnitudes higher thermal conductivity, thus providing better heat transfer throughout the solar array panel. Also proposed are innovations in co-cured substrate construction whereby a highly emissive film is cured directly into the substrate panel creating a surface for significant heat rejection a on the backside of the solar array. The front side of the panel will also include a cured in circuit trace, which will significantly reduce wiring routing on the solar panel.* [Pre-collimator Chemical Milling for X-ray Telescopes, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4ezd-iwhj) - Combining Chemical Milling with wire Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM), Mindrum Precision will build a precollimator (PC) faster and more cost effective than current methods.

  Space-based x-ray telescopes currently involve the use of a PC to shield the optics from stray light. Each PC requires extensive build time from highly skilled technicians. The PC cylindrical aluminum ribs (or blades) are individually attached to alignment frames. This hands-on "place/weld/measure and repeat" process is ineffective for the thousands of ribs. Build times have exceeded a year, and sometimes the PC still failed to perform. Some telescopes scrap the PC early to avoid these complications and accept the limitations in performance.

  Eliminating the hands-on time with CNC unattended wire EDM automates the build, but can't reach the thin walls required. Chemical milling of this large, complex structure is an innovation which will bring fast and affordable PC to market. 

  Current chemical milling uses HF and HNO3 acids to etch thin films of Titanium. However, etching is traditionally done on thin sheets. Mindrum Precision process will investigate etching of this complex material. New concentration levels, etch times, and agitation methods will be explored to achieve a uniform etch along the entire length of the numerous 3" slots.  

  Mindrum Precision will combine wire EDM with Chemical Milling to rapidly make affordable precollimators for future telescopes.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3x3c-y2vz) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios provide useful insight into the complex factors that drive ecosystem change, estimating the magnitude 

of regional pressures on ecosystems and critical uncertainties that could undermine sustainable development. They also provide an understanding of the importance of institutions and values 

as the long-range outlook for the world's ecosystems depends on the course taken by global and regional development in the coming decades. The integration of changing ecosystem conditions 

into the global scenarios was taken as both effects and causes. The MA scenarios include those for population, income, cereal production and consumption, meat production and consumption, 

land cover, waster stress, water availability, acidification and nitrogen deposition. (Suggested Usage: To preserve access to the original set of socioeconomic and natural resource scenarios used by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and other related research.)* [LBA Regional Monthly Climatology for the 20th Century (New et al.)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6mcj-hb8i) - ABSTRACT: This data set is a subset of "Global Monthly Climatology for the 20th Century (New et al.)" (2000a). This subset characterizes mean monthly surface climate over the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., latitude 10 N to 25 S, longitude 30 to 85 W) during nearly all of the 20th Century. The data are gridded at 0.5-degree latitude/longitude resolution and include seven variables: precipitation, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure, cloud cover, and ground-frost frequency. All variables have mean monthly values for the period 1901-1995, several have data as recent as 1998, and further data will be added by the data originators. In constructing the monthly grids, the authors used an anomaly approach that attempts to maximize station data in space and time (New et al. 2000b). In this technique, grids of monthly historic anomalies are derived in relation to a standard normal period. Station measurement data for the years 1961-1990 were extracted from the monthly data holdings of the Climatic Research Unit and the Global Historic Climatology Network (GHCN) and used in constructing the normal period (New et al. 1999). The anomaly grids were then combined with high-resolution mean monthly climatology to arrive at fields of estimated historical monthly surface climate. Data are in ASCII GRID format for ArcInfo. Information on creating this LBA subset is available in ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/physical_climate/GIS_EastAngliaClimateMonthly/comp/eastanglia_readme.pdf.Data users are encouraged to see the companion file New et al. (2000) for a complete description of this technique and potential applications and limitations of the data set. For additional information, refer to the IPCC Data Distribution Centre.To access the complete year-by-year monthly data set or data more recent than posted here, users may make a request with the Climate Impacts LINK Project at the Climatic Research Unit (e-mail: d.viner@uea.ac.uk; web site: www.cru.uea.ac.uk/link). LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system. More information about LBA can be found at http://www.daac.ornl.gov/LBA/misc_amazon.html.* [Micromechanical Models for Composite NDE and Diagnostics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7s66-axmk) - Modern aircraft increasingly rely on composite components, due to their excellent material properties.  However, fastening/joining and design methodologies in current use are artifacts of metallic aircraft component use and are not yet optimized for use with composites.  Furthermore, limitations in our current ability to observe manufacturing quality and in-service damage evolution of composite structures may prevent designers from realizing their full potential. Current NDE practices are incapable of overcoming these limitations. Thus, a new framework and methodology is needed for high resolution imaging and tracking of manufacturing quality and damage evolution.

The goal of this program is to enable assessment of the matrix, fiber, and bonding conditions for composites using a combination of detailed physics based models, high resolution imaging, and controlled loading sources to isolate the composite characteristic of interest.  In Phase I we will focus on magnetic field sensing (i.e., eddy-current) methods that can be combined with structural analysis to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of these NDE methods.  JENTEK and MR&D are well-positioned to deliver this methodology in the form of commercial software and NDE equipment.  We will also work with a major aircraft OEM to maintain our focus on practical solutions to high priority needs.* [Low-Loss Ferrite Components for NASA Missions, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7ie9-2qdq) - The goal of this research is to develop high-frequency Faraday rotation isolators that exhibit significantly reduced loss, higher power handling and improved bandwidth over commercially available products. The bandwidth limitations of high-frequency circulators will be explored. It was demonstrated in the Phase I work that the bandwidth of these components can be substantially increased through impedance matching techniques. At the end of the Phase II program, Micro Harmonics will have developed a full line of isolators operating in bands from WR-12 through WR-3 and circulators working in bands from WR-15 through WR-5. In the phase I work our models were proven to be accurate. The approach is fundamentally sound, but there are significant technical challenges. These components will find immediate use in a broad range of systems used by NASA as well as the commercial sector.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Population](https://data.nasa.gov/d/b3rc-4ua4) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Population data sets provide baseline population information as one of the drivers of ecosystem change. The data helped in estimating the magnitude of regional pressures on ecosystems. The MA Population data sets include Gridded Population of the World (GPW) version 3, population grids from the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) (alpha version), Global Subnational Infant Mortality Rates (alpha version), and Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition (alpha version) data. (Suggested Usage: To preserve access to the original global and regional population data used by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and other related research.)* [SMEX03 ENVISAT ASAR Data, Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5jgs-spka) - This data set is comprised of browse images acquired over the regional study areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma USA as part of the 2003 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX03).* [Advanced SiC-Matrix Composites with Improved Oxidation Resistance and Life, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kc2x-hcnx) - The objective of this proposed effort is to demonstrate the promise of advanced C/SiC and SiC/SiC composites having improved environmental durability and longer life at higher allowable stress levels without using problematic external barrier coatings. Both oxidation inhibited C/SiC and SiC/SiC composite material systems are proposed for this effort on the basis that: (1) C/SiC offers the highest use temperature and lowest cost of all currently available refractory composite systems, and (2) SiC/SiC offers the highest durability and longest life. Each material system offers unique performance/cost benefits and limitations, and each has been identified as a viable candidate for advanced propulsion and thermal protection system component applications. Oxidation resistant C/SiC and SiC/SiC composite plates will be fabricated incorporating a recently developed, 2nd generation oxidation inhibited matrix produced by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). Test samples from each material system will be prepared and experimentally evaluated in high-temperature tensile stress oxidation environments. The tensile stress rupture results will be compared to "baseline" uninhibited C/SiC and SiC/SiC composites to establish the performance benefits of the proposed approach.* [Production of Mature Highland Lunar Regolith Simulant, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jwgk-twqc) - As NASA considers manned and/or unmanned return missions to the Moon and beyond, it is imperative that high fidelity lunar soil simulants be developed in order to accurately evaluate the life span and efficiency of any equipment exposed to the lunar surface. One of the significant limitations of current simulants is the lack of certain constituents, such as agglutinates. These constituents, which can account for up to 60% by volume of a mature regolith soil, are widely regarded as components that must be present in any high fidelity simulant. Recently, Plasma Processes, Inc. has developed a process to produce Mare agglutinate simulant particles from JSC-1A feedstock. Characterization has confirmed that these agglutinate simulants have features (e.g. morphology, chemistry, crystalline phase content, nano-phase Fe) similar to actual lunar agglutinates.  When mixed with the JSC-1A root simulant in the correct proportions, the combination results in a high fidelity derivative Mare simulant. However, considering approximately 87% of the lunar surface consists of Highland regolith composition, mature Highland simulants are also of great interest. Hence, the primary technical objective of the proposed Phase I effort is to extend the technology employed to enhance the fidelity of Mare simulants to the production of high fidelity derivative Highland simulants.* [Transcription profiling of activated human T cells induced by microgravity to identify apoptotic genes and other immune response genes](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ba3q-54e9) - The purpose of this study was to search for microgravity-sensitive genes specifically for apoptotic genes influenced by the microgravity environment and other genes related to immune response. Experiment Overall Design: Two-group design with paired samples i.e. one 1G and one MMG culture came from the same donor. Therefore 6 samples came from 3 different donors.

Soil characteristics reported for all five study sites include cation information (e.g., H, Al, Mg, K, Na, S), percent of soil C, N, and organic matter, soil texture/composition and color, pH, and land use history. Soil bulk density and tons of carbon/ha are reported for only three of the study sites: Altamira, Bragantina, and Tome-Acu. All of the data are provided in one comma-separated data file.The five study areas represent characteristic differences in soil fertility and a range of land uses typical of the Amazon region. One of these areas, Altamira, is characterized by above average pH, nutrients, and texture. The other four areas are more typical of the 75 percent of the Amazon that is characterized by Oxisols and Ultisols, with well-drained but low pH and low levels of nutrients. Ponta de Pedras in Marajo Island, located in the estuary, is composed of upland Oxisols and floodplain alluvial soils. Igarape-Acu in the Bragantina region is characterized by both nutrient-poor Spodosols and Oxisols. Tome-Acu, south of Igarape-Acu, represents a mosaic of Oxisols and Ultisols. Yapu, in the Colombian Vaupes, is composed of patches of Spodosols and Oxisols. Three of the areas are colonization regions at various degrees of development: Altamira is a colonization front that opened up in 1971, whereas Tome-Acu was settled by a Japanese population in the 1930s, and Bragantina was settled in the early part of the twentieth century. Marajo (Ponta de Pedras) is the home of caboclos, whereas Yapu is home to Tukanoan Native American populations. In these study areas  slash-and-burn cultivation as well as plantation agriculture and mechanized agriculture are employed. Length of fallows vary in these communities. The two indigenous areas leave their land in longer fallow than do the three colonization areas, and the proportion of land prepared from secondary forests increases with length of settlement as the stock of mature forest declines over time.* [Asteroid Tomography](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hbca-i2rp) - <p>This proposed project will perform the study and simulation, of a concept for an instrument to tomographically map the internal density (structure) of an asteroid using Atom Interferometric Gravity Gradiometers (AIGG).&nbsp; The targeted outcomes are instrument design parameters, performance limitations, possible mission configurations, and a road map for further technology maturation.</p> <p>The objective of this project is to continue to mature the concept of the gravity gradiometer instrument through simulation, development of its design parameters, and establishing its limitation.&nbsp; The Project will work with other Projects with potential missions on which this technology would provide detection possibilities beyond current state of instrumentation.</p>* [Integrated Structural Health Management, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/js8v-8cyb) - Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) proposes to advance the state of the art in composite health management through refinement of an existing technology developed by CRG called Reflexive Composites.  Reflexive Composites are the current state of the art in health management integrating piezoelectric structural health monitoring, healable polymer matrix composites, and intelligent controls delivering highly aware structures capable of identifying location and magnitude of damage with 1/16" spatial resolution.  Reflexive Composites respond to damage with a healing cycle capable of restoring up to 90% of mechanical performance post failure.   
CRG proposes to advance the state of the art in health management through the development of a next generation control system capable of analyzing structural health monitoring (SHM) data and determining the appropriate healing cycle, identifying the type of failure in the composite, make predictions to the loss in mechanical performance, generating custom healing cycles based on failure type, healing, and making predictions of restored mechanical strength.  The results of this analysis will allow the vehicle user to make any necessary mission adjustment to ensure vehicle survivability with the damaged structures on the vehicle.* [Superconducting Resonator Spectrometer for Millimeter- and Submillimeter-Wave Astrophysics Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ubuz-hvig) - "We propose to develop a novel ultra-compact spectrograph-on-a-chip for the submillimeter and millimeter waveband. SuperSpec uses planar lithographed superconducting transmission-line filters to sort incident radiation by frequency to an array of direct detectors such as MKIDs. The system is naturally wideband and can be very low loss, enabling background-limited spectroscopy on the ground and in space, as is currently done with a diffraction grating spectrographs. But while moderate-resolution grating systems for the mm and submm bands have sizes measured in tens of centimeters, SuperSpec can have a size measured in millimeters. If successful, SuperSpec will pave the way for a new kind of astronomical instrument for the submm/mm: a 2-D array of hundreds to thousands of individual spectrometers, each simultaneously measuring a separate spectrum. With the possible exception of polarization, such an instrument extracts all available information from the light at a telescope focal plane.



SuperSpec thus offers the potential to revolutionize astrophysics in the far-IR through millimeter, an important spectral regime for which the the Astro2010 Decadal Survey made two specific recommendations for this decade: 1) Participate in the Japanese-led SPICA space telescope with a spectrometer instrument such as BLISS, and 2) Construct CCAT and its associated instrumentation. Depending on SPICA's schedule, SuperSpec technology could be injected and would enhance and extend the long-wavelength capability of BLISS or a similar instrument. Whether or not SPICA moves ahead quickly, our demonstration will position SuperSpec to be used in on CCAT and suborbital platforms this decade, paving the way for optimal science return with future NASA-led cryogenic far-IR space missions on the drawing board for the next decade: CALISTO/SAFIR and SPIRIT.



SuperSpec is based on propagation on a superconducting transmission line (TL). As radiation propagates along the line, it encounters a seri* [General Purpose Data-Driven System Monitoring for Space Operations](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gfra-htnj) - Modern space propulsion and exploration system designs are becoming increasingly
sophisticated and complex. Determining the health state of these systems using traditional methods is becoming more difficult as the number of sensors and component interactions grows. Data-driven monitoring techniques have been developed to address these issues by
analyzing system operations data to automatically characterize normal system behavior. The Inductive Monitoring System is a data-driven system health monitoring software tool that has been successfully applied to several aerospace applications. Inductive Monitoring System uses a data mining technique called clustering to analyze archived system data and characterize
normal interactions between parameters. This characterization, or model, of nominal operation is stored in a knowledge base that can be used for real-time system monitoring or
for analysis of archived events. Ongoing and developing Inductive Monitoring System space operations applications include International Space Station flight control, spacecraft vehicle
system health management, launch vehicle ground operations, and fleet supportability. As a common thread of discussion this paper will employ the evolution of the Inductive Monitoring
System data-driven technique as related to several Integrated Systems Health Management elements. Thematically, the projects listed will be used as case studies. The maturation of Inductive Monitoring System via projects where it has been deployed or is currently being
integrated to aid in fault detection will be described. The paper will also explain how Inductive Monitoring System can be used to complement a suite of other Integrated System Health Management tools, providing initial fault detection support for diagnosis and recovery.* [Large-Area, Self-Sufficient, Low-Cost MEMS Skin with Integrated Wirleless Communication Capability, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dhnk-nru5) - An integrated unit that harnesses its energy from its surroundings and reacts to, and transmits, any changes in its environment in a predictable and reliable manner would be of significant benefit to the sensor community.  Advances in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), silicon, SiGe, and GaAs fabrication technologies have helped to constantly add new sensing and communication functionality in a given device footprint.  A significant limitation with the current state-of-the-art processes though, is the constraint to fabricate devices and circuits on a relatively high-cost, defect-free, single-crystal, base substrate.  This has also limited the potential of an integrated mixed-material design solution that is a key to high-performance communication systems.  Finally, a lack of large-area processing tools has precluded the development of a stand-alone, large-area sensor skin.  Building on Anvik?s proven, large-area, excimer laser based recrystallization and annealing technologies, and ongoing efforts in developing MEMS process technologies on flexible substrates, we propose to develop a fabrication technology to enable wireless communication circuitry on low-cost, flexible base substrates for large-area ?skins?.  There are several applications for this technology in free-moving sensor systems, space-based MEMS and distributed sensor networks for health-monitoring of space based systems, and commercial applications such as cell-phones and PDAs.* [Functionalized Nano-Film Microchannel Plate: A Single High Aspect Ratio Device for High Resolution, Low Noise Astronomical Imaging, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i6kh-5eha) - The proposed innovation is to apply proven nano-film technology to enable Microchannel plate (MCP) devices to be manufactured on a range of insulating substrates and devices which possess sufficiently high gain and low ion feedback to replace chevron stacks in current NASA detector technologies.  Commercial MCP devices have many desirable properties, such as sensitivity to small amounts of light and excellent position and timing resolution.  MCP production is a mature technology, based largely on techniques and materials developed in the 1970's, and is limited to small area devices. Limitations due to the bulk glass manufacturing technology adversely impact many applications and impair manufacturability.  For example, heavy metal impurities contained within the bulk glass of the MCP limit the achievable dark noise in low signal detection.   In MCP manufacturing, the requisite batch processing restricts flexibility to tailor individual device or small batch performance to specific applications and can often result in poor MCP yield due to variations in composition and poor process control.   In this proposal, we will utilize atomic layer deposition (ALD) of nanometer thin films which has been proven to replicate and improve the component functions of secondary electron emission (SEE) and conductivity on non-traditional glass substrates, to investigate the high gain and low ion feedback capabilities of this technology.  We estimate that the technology stands at TRL 2 at the and expect to be at 4 at end of the Phase 1 contract.* [Miniaturized High Performance Optical Gyroscope, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gvmt-2x42) - We propose a new approach for to the design and fabrication of miniaturized Interferometric Fiber Optical Gyroscope (FOG) that enables the production of smaller IRU with enhanced performance. The size and performance limitations of the standard FOG are being reduced due to the utilization of highly integrated approach of all the gyro components. Specifically, the ASE light source and the receivers, splitters and TIA are all incorporated in a small, robust silicon/silica platform using hybrid integration. In addition, the sensor is using an innovative new coil design and high performance miniaturized IOC that results in tenfold reduction of the bias temperature sensitivity compared to the existing FOG products. The combination of these attributes supports a smaller, lower cost, high performance and robust IRU that can serve future NASA mission needs.* [Space Radiation Risk Assessment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/skv9-cxne) - Project A: Integration and Review: A review of current knowledge from space radiation physics was accepted for publication in Reviews of Modern Physics (Durante and Cucinotta, 2011). Several Graphical Users Interface’s (GUI) of risk assessment models and computational tools were developed and published including: a) ARRBOD (Acute Radiation Risk and BRYTNRN Organ Dose);  b) NSCR (NASA Space Cancer Risk) c) GERMCode (Galactic Cosmic Radiation, GCR, Event-based Risk Model); d) RITracks (Relativistic Ion Track Structure). The GERMcode was developed to accurately describe fragmentation in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) beam-line and biological samples, and basic radiobiology experiments.     <p></p>

4)	Revised uncertainty assessments for all model coefficients in the risk model (physics, low LET risk coefficients, dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF), and quality factors), and an alternative uncertainty assessment that considers deviation from linear responses due to non-targeted effects (NTE).    <p></p>
Results of calculations for the average U.S. population show more restrictive dose limits for astronauts above age 40 y as compared to National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Report 132, and a modest narrowing of uncertainties if NTEs are not included and much broader uncertainties with NTEs. Risks for never-smokers compared to the average U.S. population are estimated in a mixture model to be reduced by more than 20% and 30% for males and females, respectively. A larger reduction is possible if purely multiplicative risk transfer is assumed.     <p></p>
Project C: Biochemical Kinetics Models of Molecular Pathways: A system biology model (Cucinotta et al., 2008) of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway was developed and used to make quantitative descriptions of the gamma H2AX foci and double strand break (DSB) rejoining experiments. The model is extended to consider the radiation quality dependence of the relative fraction of simple and complex DSB, rejoining and associated repair defects, and the kinetics of various radiation induced foci (RIF). In further work, the addition of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and the MRN complex to the model was achieved and the role of processing damaged ends by the Artemis proteins is being modeled (Li and Cucinotta, 2011).  The interaction of several growth factors with NHEJ components was studied, including the interaction of the growth factors EGFR, IGF1, and TGFbeta-Smad with ATM and DNA-PK. New approaches to Green’s functions for stochastic treatment of molecular diffusion processes were developed (Plante et al. 2011). Flow cytometry or immune-staining considers signals in individual cells and thus provides several unique capabilities to support computation modeling using stochastic approaches. In contrast, methods that average the values of many cells such as Western blots, gene arrays, etc. are limited in elucidating events at low dose where fluctuations are expected to be important. To improve our understanding of DNA repair complexes numerical approaches to simulate immunohistochemistry (Ponomarev et al., 2008,* [Broadband Reflective Coating Process for Large FUVOIR Mirrors, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sfhn-g8xj) - ZeCoat Corporation will develop and demonstrate a set of revolutionary coating processes for making broadband reflective coatings suitable for very large mirrors (4+ meters). Decades of research and flight missions (Hubble, GALAX and FUSE) have utilized metal fluorides such as, MgF2 and LiF, applied to Al to achieve FUVOIR coating requirements. While metal fluoride-protected Al remains the best option for meeting broadband reflectance requirements (90-nm to 2500-nm), ZeCoat offers a means to build upon the best known and proven coating recipe (the GSFC 3-step process) by: 1) utilizing ZeCoat's unique precision motion-controlled deposition system to uniformly apply a 5-nm layer (a requirement of the GSFC recipe) of coating material to a large coating area, 2) protecting mirror assemblies from damaging high temperatures by heating only the mirror surface using radiant heat (the GSFC process requires a 220C metal-fluoride deposition temperature), 3) using an FUV reflectometer (120-nm to 180-nm) integrated into the coating chamber to optimize the coating process for FUV reflectance and 4) investigating the feasibility of using a layer of Sn to protect LiF from degradation due to atmospheric moisture and organic contamination during ground storage and  re-evaporate the Sn once the observatory is placed in-orbit.* [Microdischarge Array Flexible Light Source for High-Efficiency Irradiation of Spaced-Based Crops, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v6kj-7z6e) - It is desirable to develop a high-efficiency lighting source for large-area irradiation of space-based crops.  The key requirements for such a system include high efficiency,  light weight, easy and rapid deployment, compact storage, ruggedness, and low cost.  Furthermore, in order to maximize the rate of photosynthesis, it is desirable that the light source deliver an emission spectrum that matches the absorbance spectrum of chlorophyll as closely as possible while minimizing the effects of emission outside of the visible spectrum.  To address these demanding requirements and overcome the limitations of alternative technologies, we propose to develop a large-area, high-efficiency, flexible sheet light source using microdischarge arrays using the combined talents of Anvik Corporation and a team from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, led by Prof. J. Gary Eden.  The development of a new technology to enable the fabrication of large-area, high-density microdischarge arrays on flexible substrates, possibly powered by solar cells, will enable dramatic advances in the portability, ruggedness, efficiency, and light quality of light sources for space-based crop irradiation and a wide variety of commercial applications, including LCD backlighting, large-area UV-curing, decorative lighting, photodynamic therapy, and germicidal applications.* [Lightweight High Temperature Beta Gamma Alloy/Process Development for Disk and Blade Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a4v6-9kwq) - The primary material and manufacturing limitations of gamma TiAl alloys include processing difficulties, requiring costly non-conventional processing requirements, and large lamellar grains, which reduces damage tolerance.  We have developed a new class of TiAl-based alloys, called beta gamma, which would remove such barriers.   Unlike existing gamma alloys, beta gamma alloys are designed such that the ductile â phase is adequate at elevated temperatures (for processing) but negligible at the anticipated use temperatures (for performance).  The alloys also feature significant grain refinement and compositional homogeneity.  This program is aimed to utilize such beneficial beta-phase distribution and microstructure features observed in small (0.7kg) samples into forged disks from medium size (25kg) ingots.  The process-ability will be validated by employing a conventional forging process, and refined lamellar microstructures will be generated through usual alpha treatments.  The significance of this innovation is that beta gamma alloy disks can not only be produced by conventional forging, but also show improvements in RT strength and ductility and may retain other attributes (density, creep and oxidation) of conventional gamma alloys.* [Laser frequency stabilization and stray light issues for LISA and other future multi-spacecraft missions Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/psmf-ze9h) - "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a joint NASA/ESA project which will use laser interferometry between drag-free proof masses to measure gravitational waves from many galactic and cosmological sources. The same interferometer technology is also the key to future multi-spacecraft missions such as multi-aperture telescope missions. These missions could include several spacecraft all separated by potentially 10s of km, flying in a fixed formation with sub-wavelength variations in their distances. These multi-aperture or distributed aperture telescopes will revolutionize the angular resolution in the infrared, optical, and even X-ray band.  This proposal addresses two components which are both critical to these missions.

The first component introduces a new technique to stabilize the laser frequency to an optical reference cavity. Laser frequency noise will be the limiting factor for most of the distributed aperture telescope missions; in contrast, LISA can trade frequency noise against ranging precision. This new technique is based on heterodyne interferometry which is also used to measure changes in the distances between the spacecraft. Because of this similarity, this  technology can easily be integrated into the payload. It requires the same photo detectors and digital signal processing systems that are used for the interferometry. It utilizes to a large degree existing components, reducing R&amp;D time and cost for all interferometric space missions. We have already started initial proof of principle experiments and have reached already a performance remarkably close to the performance of the standard and long time-favored modulation/demodulation technique. Now we propose to study this technique in more detail, study the limiting noise sources experimentally and theoretically, and push it to the limitations of the reference cavity itself. The expected final fractional frequency noise should be better than 0.01ppt for measurement times of a 1000s.

(2000a). This subset characterizes mean monthly surface climate over the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., latitude 10 N to 25 S, longitude 30 to 85 W) during nearly all of the 20th Century. The data are gridded at 0.5-degree latitude/longitude resolution and include seven variables: precipitation, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure, cloud cover, and ground-frost frequency. All variables have mean monthly values for the period 1901-1995, several have data as recent as 1998, and further data will be added by the data originators. In constructing the monthly grids, the authors used an anomaly approach that attempts to maximize station data in space and time (New et al. 2000b). In this technique, grids of monthly historic anomalies are derived in relation to a standard normal period. Station measurement data for the years 1961-1990 were extracted from the monthly data holdings of the Climatic Research Unit and the Global Historic Climatology Network (GHCN) and used in constructing the normal period (New et al. 1999). The anomaly grids were then combined with high-resolution mean monthly climatology to arrive at fields of estimated historical monthly surface climate. Data are in ASCII GRID format for ArcInfo. Information on creating this LBA subset is available in ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/physical_climate/GIS_EastAngliaClimateMonthly/comp/eastanglia_readme.pdf.Data users are encouraged to see the companion file New et al. (2000) for a complete description of this technique and potential applications and limitations of the data set.

LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system.

The Micro Return Capsule (MIRCA) is CAPE&rsquo;s first Planetary Entry Probe (PEP) flight prototype. Within this context, this project continues to develop the CAPE concept, and as part of the technology pathway,&nbsp;will carry out a balloon drop test flight experiment of MIRCA to verify deployment, flight software, communications, and aerodynamic parameters in a relevant environment.</p> <p>So far, no microprobe (less than 10 kg) has entered another planetary atmosphere and successfully relayed data back to Earth. Although the Deep Space 2 Mars microprobes did reach their destination (total mass about 6.5 kg each), unfortunately they were lost due to a combination of delivery system failures and other unknown factors. This project&nbsp;expands on the concept of a planetary entry probe based on the widely popular Cubesat-class spacecraft specification (Cubesat Application for Planetary Entry Missions, or CAPE probes). Within a science operational context, CAPE probes may be sent from Earth to study a celestial body&rsquo;s atmosphere, or to land/impact on some high-value target on its surface. Either one or multiple probes may be targeted to distributed locations throughout the geographic landscape and could be released systematically and methodically from an orbiting spacecraft. CAPE microprobes would each have its own propulsion, and hence would be capable of targeting regions identified by the mother ship as high-interest. This enables a completely new capability for science not possible with traditional &ldquo;drop-and-flyby&rdquo; schemes. To supplement its flexibility, each probe would incorporate a communications architecture that provides a high-level of assurance its precious data is acquired and transmitted back to Earth for analysis.&nbsp;CAPE consists of two main functional components: the &ldquo;service module&rdquo; (SM), and the &ldquo;planetary entry probe&rdquo; (PEP). The SM contains the subsystems necessary to support vehicle targeting (propulsion, ACS, computer, power) and the communications capability to relay data from the PEP probe to an orbiting &ldquo;mother-ship&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The PEP itself carries the scientific instrumentation capable of measuring atmospheric properties (such as density, temperature, composition), and embedded engineering sensors for Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) technology monitoring and assessment.

This size limitation prevents using this fabrication method for production of molds for operational size space concentrators and off-axis (non-concentric) patterns cannot be produced at all with lathes.  UAT has been demonstrated that computer numerical control (CNC) milling machines that can readily machine complex geometries, including any radius of curvature, can be used to produce mold segments representing any portion of any size MPRS.  These mold patterns can then be replicated on thin film sheets, which are then appropriately integrated to produce solar concentrators of the desired size. Multiple focal lengths/points, concentration ratios, and controlled flux distribution can be incorporated in a single reflector panel allowing substantial and previously unavailable Wireless Power Transfer System design flexibility.
	The Phase I program will verify the thin film performance capabilities and scalability of the MPRS concept and the Phase II program will provide a full scale concentrator applicable to Wireless Power Transfer technology for testing and deployment.* [High Test Peroxide High Sealing Conical Seal, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pekh-gem9) - High Test Peroxide (HTP) Highly Compatible High Sealing Conical Seals are necessary for ground test operations and space based applications.  Current conical seals are all made from relatively incompatible materials and the most compatible materials have limitations: stainless steel seals are hard to seat, especially at large sizes and are still only acceptable for short term exposure at best, whereas aluminum seals corrode quickly when exposed to HTP and other metals such as stainless steel.  The other common materials for conical seals, copper and nickel, are unsuited for HTP applications.  A highly compatible conical seal is non-existent, and the best seal available is stainless steel which is at best Class 2 and difficult to seal.  High compatible conical seals will permit long term storage HTP systems to be created and will improve operations which are currently using short term HTP systems.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Diurnal (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pwvn-iv8e) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present.

Current technologies including 3He detectors, scintillators, and solid-state detectors are bulky and expensive.  We developed a new radiation detection method and architecture. Some liquids react to radiation exposure with a change in molecular structure, leading to a change in properties such as dielectric constant and polarization. Inspired by such responsivity of liquids, we  constructed a transistor with a radiation-responsive liquid as a gate dielectric replacing the conventional oxide gate layer. The current voltage characteristics of the liquid gate dielectric transistor  change upon exposure to any type of radiation. Different types of liquids that specifically interact with various target radiations can be used in an array of transistors serving as a radiation nose to discriminate different radiation sources. Moreover, the fluidity of the liquid facilitates the exchange of the damaged liquid with fresh liquid after some time, allowing a reusable sensor. Selection of liquid-state gate dielectric is important for an acceptable device performance, and the choice should satisfy the following requirements: insulating properties, proper dielectric constant, dielectric strength, thermal stability, high purity, low moisture absorption, low viscosity, and responsive to radiation. Preliminary results from this project include detection of gamma radiation.  Future work would include development of a radiation nose capable of detecting multiple types of radiation with energy discrimination.</p>* [Paper-based Biosensor for Rapid Colorimetric Detection of Pathogenic Bacteria](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gc4j-v5av) - <p>The current project proposes to develop a real-time method for identification of targeted microorganisms using a paper-based biosensor system with ease-of-use, minimal requirement of time, and a simple interpretation of results imparted by colorimetric indication. To prove the feasibility of this approach, a binding target (ligand), specific for the bacterial pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, will be attached to gold nanoparticle carriers (nanoconjugate), that are supported on a paper strip. Upon interaction with the bacteria, the nanoconjugates will aggregate, resulting in a color change on the paper.  Due to the high sensitivity and specificity of the ligand, only the presence of S. aureus in a sample will result in a color change.<p/><p>The ability to monitor microbial contamination remains a critical technique in the mitigation of risk to crew health and vehicle systems during human spaceflight missions. Current methods of bacterial and fungal monitoring on the International Space Station (ISS) depend on culturing of microorganisms during spaceflight and subsequent ground-based identification. This approach requires substantial crew time, uses consumables with short shelf lives, and prevents a rapid response to microbial contamination. To address these limitations for future missions beyond low-Earth orbit, a biosensor using gold nanoparticles is being developed for the rapid detection of medically significant microorganisms. For proof-of-concept, we have targeted the detection of Staphylococcus aureus, a common infectious agent that has been repeatedly isolated aboard the ISS. Gold nanoparticles were modified by the covalent attachment of an antibody that has a high binding affinity for a protein on the cell wall of S. aureus. Upon interaction with a sample containing S. aureus, binding between the nanoparticles and the bacteria occurred rapidly. A significant reduction in the red coloration of the colloidal nanoparticle suspension, and the formation of a large purple pellet was observed following a brief centrifugation step. Comparison of the absorbance spectra verified the visual observation, demonstrating that there was a significant reduction in the absorbance of the supernatants of reaction samples in which S. aureus was present. This biosensing system provides a rapid means to specifically detect only the targeted organism. Further development will potentially lead to a small, lightweight biosensor that can be easily adapted to detect other selected microorganisms in real-time, providing crews of future spaceflight missions a simple method to autonomously define potential infectious disease risks.</p>* [Three-Axis Gasless Sounding Rocket Payload Attitude Control](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jfmb-2ch4) - <p>Gas released by current sounding rocket payload attitude control systems (ACS) has the potential to interfere with some types of science instruments. A single-axis gasless ACS experiment was successfully flown on a sounding rocket. The single-axis system is being expanded to three axes to provide gasless attitude control with greater accuracy than is presently achievable.</p><p>Sounding rocket payload attitude is currently controlled by a system of cold gas thrusters. The gas released by the thruster has the potential to interfere with science instruments that are sensing matter in the local environment. There is interest in the sounding rocket science community in an ACS that can provide fine attitude control without releasing gas. A three-axis reaction wheel assembly (RWA) can provide gasless fine attitude control during science operations. Large maneuvers and coarse control would still be provided by the standard cold gas thrusters, but the gas would be shut off and control would be handed over to the RWA during portions of the flight critical to sensitive science instruments. In addition to being gasless, a RWA ACS can also provide more precise attitude control than can be achieved through pulsed thrusting of a cold gas system.</p><p>A single-axis gasless ACS proof of concept experiment was flown March 1, 2016.</p><p>The scope of the project is to expand the single-axis system used for the proof of concept flight into a three-axis ACS. Existing software for the controller and software-in-the-loop (SWIL) simulation testing will need to be expanded to include pitch and yaw axes. Maneuver limits and wheel saturation rates with typical disturbances will be estimated to create a trade space of hardware requirements, and hardware that meets those requirements will be identified. Potential processors will be evaluated. Wheels will be sized for the pitch and yaw axes and re-evaluated for the roll axis. Capability for spinning attitude control will also be added. Performance estimates will be made for both the LN-200 and the more accurate LN-251 IRU.</p><p>The overall objective of the project is to mature the three-axis design to the point that it will represent a minimal schedule risk when included in either a Sounding Rocket Program Office (SRPO) development mission or a science mission willing to take a risk on a developmental system, and to develop an accurate cost estimate to aid in securing funding for a flight demonstration.

(LGR) and Professor Martin Fejer and his group at Stanford University propose to develop and demonstrate a compact, monolithic, efficient, high-power, narrow-linewidth tunable laser source operating in the 3.2-3.4 um wavelength region. LGR's mid-infrared (mid-IR) light source, based on a fiber-laser pumped monolithic optical parametric oscillator (OPO) developed at Stanford, will assist NASA in completing its trace-gas-detection objectives by supplying NASA with a critical, difficult-to-obtain laser source suitable for continuous-wave (cw) spectroscopy. During Phase I, LGR and Stanford will manufacture a monolithic OPO crystal, using techniques established by Stanford, generating between 1-2 W of single-frequency radiation between 3.2-3.4 um. At the end of Phase I, the OPO system will be used to measure transmission through a 50-cm-long methane cell (manufactured by LGR) at wavelengths corresponding to the C-H stretch vibrational resonance, 3.3 um. Technology readiness level (TRL) 4 will be reached at the completion of Phase I. During Phase II, remote detection of methane will be performed using a methane cell and measuring the backscattered light from the cell as the OPO mid-IR frequency is scanned ~5 GHz. The size of the housing for the monolithic OPO will be designed to reduce the overall size and weight of the mid-IR-laser head. Fiber-coupling for the incoming pump and the outgoing mid-IR radiation will be added to the OPO housing enabling simple fiber delivery. Modeling of the system sensitivity in ppm of methane will be performed for the final remote sensing system for ground-, air-, and space-based operation.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Time Average 1-hourly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f6t6-w69c) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present.

The IGS Final products are the basis for the IGS reference frame and are intended for those applications demanding high consistency and quality.* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k86t-awrb) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard 

total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and 

volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. 

(2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined 

using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational 

GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per 

grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional 

economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the 

range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is 

generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia 

University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and 

Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Superconducting Resonant Inductive Power Coupling, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e5by-xv3f) - The proposed effort will develop a technology to wirelessly and efficiently transfer power over hundreds of meters via resonant inductive coupling.  The key innovation of this approach is the use of dielectricless high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils to overcome the limitations in efficiency and range of existing solutions.  This approach is informed by existing research models that predict a nominal application of this technique is capable of delivering 100 Watts of power at a distance of 100 meters with over 90% efficiency.  A notional application of the technology is to deliver power to rovers exploring the inside of craters at the Lunar poles, where solar power is not available.  The naturally low temperatures would eliminate the need for thermal control overhead on the rover, allowing the system to be charged from a completely unenergized state or powered directly.  Multiple rovers could be powered by the same transmission system and there would be no pointing requirements for operation.  The phase I effort will demonstrate efficient wireless power transfer using superconducting wires as a proof of concept (TRL 3-4), which will be integrated with existing thermal control technology (TRL 4) into a working prototype (TRL 6) at the end of Phase II.* [SEDIMENT ANALYSIS NETWORK FOR DECISION SUPPORT (SANDS) LANDSAT GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF AL (GSA) ANALYSIS V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6cjq-rekr) - The Geological Survey of Alabama (GSA) analyzed changes in the coastal shoreline and sedimentation using Landsat geotiff images as part of the Sediment Analysis Network for Decision Support (SANDS) project.  The daytime geotiffs images from Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 were analyzed for sediment re-distribution after a hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Alabama and part of the Florida area having coordinates 31 to 27 North latitude and 90 to 84.25 West longitude.  These are seasonal data for storms from 2001-2008.  In addition to the analyzed files, the data files include the ESRI files for zipped bands and grids, metadata, and storm temporal information for the sediment analysis images.* [Multilevel Control & Optimization of Future Air Traffic Systems via Managem](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9kin-9dcu) - <p>We investigate solutions to problems of air traffic control subject to real-world limitations on the computational/communication cost of finding that solution. The approach involves direct quantification of controllability of the system via establishing a set of comprehensive physical constraints on trajectory calculations. We develop practical and quantifiable measures of controllability and complexity to facilitate provability of system safety and inform the needs of functional allocation.</p><p>Controlling air traffic on all temporal and spatial scales – from a single aircraft to the entire airspace – can be formally stated as a dynamic, high-dimensional optimization problem with many objectives and constraints based on physics, economics, information, and other considerations. Especially in the future NAS, attempting to find the optimal solution to such problems as they arise during operations would often violate practical constraints such as computation time and/or communication resources. The issue is how to find the best solution subject to such constraints on the solution-finding algorithm. We propose to approach this as a multilevel optimization problem, where a complexity measure F maps the combination of s and an algorithm alpha (e.g., an algorithm that searches over a specified class of fine-grained traffic flows all having a given large-scale flow) to whether applying alpha to s would violate the practical constraints. Given F, the higher level optimization problem identifies the member of a set A of candidate algorithms that has best likely value of the objective functions, subject to provided practical constraints on the algorithm. A lower level optimizer then runs that algorithm and by construction is likely to do so within the given practical constraints. The technical approach will use mathematical programming, Probability Collectives (PC), and Machine Learning (ML), among other areas. The ultimate goal is a methodology and tools for use both in research and as a decision-making aid for all system participants, including aircraft pilots and automatic systems, air traffic controllers, and airlines.</p>* [Multi-Parameter Measurement in Unseeded Flows using Femtosecond Lasers (Tier 1)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3959-38sa) - <p>Measurements in NASA's wind tunnels generally consist of force and moment and on-body measurements like surface pressure, surface deflection or heat transfer to the surface.  Detailed off-body measurements are needed to understand complex wind tunnel flows and to provide data to validate high-fidelity computational models. Most existing techniques capable of measuring detailed off-body flows, for example, particle image velocimetry, require particle or gas seeding which is not possible in many of NASA's tunnels. In this project, two techniques utilizing new femtosecond laser technology will be investigated. Both techniques show promise of measuring multiple parameters quantitatively in unseeded wind tunnel flows. The femtosecond laser electronic excitation and tagging (FLEET) technique can measure velocity and potentially pressure and temperature simultaneously. The femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (FS-CARS) technique can measure pressure, temperature and species concentrations. The two techniques have relative advantages and limitations that will be explored.  The objective of this research project is to leverage recent advancements in laser technology and recent discoveries in academia to discover and apply new ways of measuring aerospace flows. In particular, methods of measuring the gas velocity, pressure, temperature and concentration will be developed. The two different measurement techniques share a common femtosecond laser technology and can be used separately or together to measure multiple gas properties simultaneously in wind tunnel flows and possibly in flight. In this project, we are extending the ability of FLEET to measure multiple parameters such as pressure and temperature simultaneous with velocity.  These additional parameters will be obtained by observing and interpreting the amplitude and spectrum of the FLEET signal.  The main novelty of the proposed work is that FLEET should allow velocity to be measured in several facilities where velocity cannot be curren</p>* [Magnetohydrodynamic-based Laboratories on a Chip for Analysis of Biomolecules, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tnit-uy3c) - A laboratory-on-a-chip design based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) microfluidics and integrated microelectrochemical detection is proposed.  The proposed device is well-suited for the rapid, automatic and highly sensitive detection of a wide variety of biomolecules of potential interest to NASA.  Interest in MHD microfluidic devices has previously been limited by their tendency to generate obstructive bubbles and to suffer quick erosion of the electrodes.  The proposed approach solves these problems and provides for very high flow rates and long electrode lifetimes.  In addition, the proposed device can be operated at very low voltage, and contain no moving parts, features that currently are not available with other forms of microfluidic devices.  In the present approach, the many significant advantages of MHD-based microfluidic systems are retained, including compatibility with a much wider variety of materials and solvents than electrokinetic based systems.  An integrated, self-contained microelectrochemical detection approach can be used in turbid, colored, or complex samples with a minimum or absence of false positives and false negatives.  Together, the two technologies offer a unique platform for biomolecular analysis.  For space applications where minimum sample handling steps and maximum automation are typically highly desired features, the proposed system should excel.* [Innovative Solid State Lighting Replacements for Industrial and Test Facility Locations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cwqe-e8cp) - The proposed innovation is the replacement of existing test stand and parking lot  fixtures with current SSL LED technology. The replacement fixtures will reduce energy consumption, generate less heat and provide maintenance free operation for over 50,000 hours. An explosion-proof fixture is capable of containing an internal combustion event without allowing flames or hot gasses to escape to the surrounding environment. The lighting fixture defined is an explosion-proof fixture for use in hazardous hydrogen/oxygen atmospheres. Current fixtures contain a 110 Watt reflectored incandescent lamp. SSL sources are remarkably efficient compared to incandescent sources. The 110 Watt lamp in existing explosion-proof fixtures will be replaced by an SSL fixture requiring only around 29 Watts for the equivalent lighting output.  The proposed Energy Focus solution will be an efficient, solid-state, explosion-proof  fixture for use in hydrogen/oxygen atmospheres which is compatible with current systems and provides the required lighting distribution. It will do this through advanced thermal and electrical power management to ensure long fixture life* [Adaptable and Reconfigurable Modular Systems (GSFC) - Plug and Play, Distributed Avionics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jpqi-ykjn) - In order to execute the President's Vision for Space Exploration, NASA must find ways to reduce spacecraft cost, complexity, and integration and test time while increasing mission. Modular, reconfigurable satellite technologies are being developed at Goddard Space Flight Center for increasingly ambitious missions involving humans and robots. Development is on-going at both GSFC and the Air Force Research Lab investigating high speed spacecraft data network architectures based on commercial Ethernet protocols. The advantages of an Ethernet network protocol include supporting FPGA implementation, broadcast capability, and most importantly extensive support by commercial standards and infrastructure. MicroSat Systems Inc. is proposing development of an Ethernet version of its modular, plug and play Intelligent Power/Data Ring avionics architecture. MSI's revolutionary architecture provides a modular, plug and play network of standardized attachment nodes distributing power and data management functions.  Since the IPDR network implements a common set of standardized nodes for every interface versus customized cards, the system cost and integration time is reduced to 40-60% of comparable centralized systems.  During the Phase 1 MSI proposes to develop a concept and analyze the benefits of Ethernet protocol in the IPDR architecture and quantify those benefits in a breadboard test environment.* [Wireless Health Monitoring for Large Arrays of MEMS Sensors and Actuators, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5kf7-reaw) - The objective of this Phase I project is to demonstrate an automated on-line structural health monitoring system for aircraft structures using a combination of wireless data acquisition and fault detection filter via a sensing network for vehicle-embedded large arrays of MEMS sensors and actuators. A fault detection filter, whose functions are to identify and localize the damage, is considered as a new concept in the field of structural health monitoring. Sensor validation is implemented in the distributed sensor network to ensure only validated data are sent to the central station for further system utilization. Wireless communication provides a safe, affordable, and more efficient method for the online health monitoring of vehicle subsystems and information monitoring.  It also involves signal processing to support decision-making related to safety, maintenance, or operating procedures.* [Miniaturized Lightweight Monopropellant Feed System for Nano- and Micro-satellites, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dgiu-nxxw) - There is a need for viable and practical solutions for utilizing chemical thrusters operating with green monopropellants on small- and micro-satellites and cubesats (100 kg-500 kg and less than 100 kg).  Conventional approaches scale down poorly, due to the size, mass, and power requirements of components needed for high pressure propellant storage and flow control.  For small spacecraft already facing significant mass and volume constraints, these systems severely limit the amount of propellant storage capacity.  
Systima proposes to develop a miniaturized low power propellant feed and flow control system for green monopropellant thrusters that enables use of very low-pressure propellant storage vessels and high efficiency packaging.  The proposed system can provide full feed system and flow control functionality for 0.5 to 1N-scale green monopropellant thrusters while consuming less than 1 Watt.  There are no limitations on the type monopropellant that can be used with Systima's miniaturized pump.  This program will target development of the pump for use with propulsion systems operating with advanced green monopropellant AF-M315E.  This monopropellant has low-toxicity making it easy to store, integrate into modular designs and launch without added costs associated with handling toxic propellants such as hydrazine. In the Phase I program Systima will demonstrate the technology through analysis, and fabrication and testing of critical components.  Phase I testing will evaluate preliminary system operation parameters that will be used to develop an integrated pump concept design.  In Phase II, Systima will design and fabricate an integrated prototype pump system to demonstrate system performance and capability to meet thruster feed system requirements.  Optimization of the design to minimize the system size, weight and power requirements will be conducted for chemical propulsion system integration onto small spacecraft.* [SAFARI 2000 LAI and FPAR Measurements at Sua Pan, Botswana, Dry Season 2000](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sm3n-5wj7) - The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Validation team was deployed to the Sua Pan salt playa in the Magkadigkadi region of Botswana during the SAFARI 2000 Dry Season Aircraft Campaign to collect various data sets for validating the MISR LAI/FPAR algorithm. Ground measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) were made using the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer and Sunfleck PAR ceptometer, respectively, during focused periods from August 20 to August 28, 2000 at a dry grassland site adjacent to the Sua Pan. The 1 km by 1 km sampling grid was a homogeneous, relatively dense grassland, with a height of 20-100 cm and two prevalent grass types, Odyssea paucinervis and Sporobolus spicatus. Associated reflectance measurements were made with the PARABOLA and ASD instruments (Helmlinger et al., 2004a; 2004b).The data files contain measurements of LAI and PAR reflectance and transmission and a description of sky conditions during the sampling periods. With one exception, all measurements were made under clear sky conditions.  PAR data were measured only on the transect scale while LAI are provided at both pixel and transect scales. PAR readings were performed at 93 transect sample points, and LAI readings were performed at 135 (93 transect and 42 subgrid) sample points. Each file also contains mean LAI and PAR values. The data files are ASCII tables, in comma-separated-value format.* [Next Generation Fiber Coherent Lidar System for Wake Vortex Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xzzb-t8mc) - LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) systems have proven their value in the remote measurement of spatially resolved atmospheric wind velocities in a number of applications, including the detection of clear-air turbulence, wind shear, aircraft wake vortices, and microbursts.  The capacity of coherent LIDAR systems to produce a continuous, real-time 3D scan of wind velocities via detection of the Mie backscatter of atmospheric aerosols in clear-air conditions and at stand-off distances of up to 50 km at relatively low pulse energy gives this technology a clear advantage over other atmospheric monitoring technologies.

During the execution of contract NNX11CG87P SIBELLOPTICS assembled the key components of the fiber-based transceiver in a breadboard system and demonstrated performance against proprietary LIDAR modeling.  In addition, we were able to demonstrate 12 hour battery-powered operation, a unique, compact BPLO method that uses quad-cells, and were able to take a significant step towards future miniaturization by packaging the fiber sub-assembly on a 1-ft x 1-ft optical bench.
  
In Phase II, it is proposed that, based upon Phase I efforts, a brassboard version of the fiber-LIDAR system be designed, assembled, and tested including data collection, processing, and display capabilities. The system will include custom opto-mechanical designs of mounts and benches, packaged components for reduced SWAP and more robust operation, and higher output energy to increase sensitivity.  Software will be developed to demonstrate real-time capability to collect, process, and display data in real-time using a unique interactive user interface.* [NACP Regional: Original Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ji9c-55um) - This data set contains the originally-submitted observation measurement data, terrestrial biosphere model output data, and inverse model simulations that various investigator teams contributed to the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis activities. The data set provides nine (9) data packages of remote sensing and ground observation measurements (OM) (MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP), MODIS net primary production (NPP), MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPar), MODIS leaf area index (LAI), MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), MODIS normalize difference vegetation index (NDVI), Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) forest biomass, National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) crop NPP, and Flux Anomaly). The data set also provides data packages of simulation results from 19 terrestrial biosphere models (TBM) and eight (8) inverse models (IM). The data packages are respectively OM, TBM, and IM data files listed in Tables 4-6. Each OM, TBM, and IM data package contains all of the original data (and documentation, if any) that the NACP Modeling and Synthesis Thematic Data Center (MAST-DC) acquired or received. These originally-submitted data were processed by the MAST-DC to produce the three standardized gridded data sets of carbon flux for inter-comparison purposes (see Related Data Products below). These original data and documentation are provided to allow users of the standardized gridded data products to be able to trace back to the data origins when needed. The Data Center (ORNL DAAC) transformed some of the originally-submitted data files to file formats that are more suitable for long-term archiving. For example, *.xlsx files were saved as *.csv, ERDAS Imagine files were converted to GeoTIFFs, and MATLAB files were converted to GeoTIFF and NetCDF formats as appropriate. Files received in NetCDF, GeoTIFF, and HDF formats were not transformed.* [Monthly Climate Data for Selected USGS HCDN Sites, 1951-1990](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c3vs-6963) - ABSTRACT: Time series of monthly minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were derived for 1337 watersheds in the conterminous United States for sites found in the national streamflow database, termed the hydroclimatologic data network (HCDN), developed by Slack et al. (1993a,b). Estimates were derived for the years 1951-1990.This HCDN data set consists of records of average daily streamflow at 1553 sites located throughout the United States. The data meet certain measurement accuracy criterion outlined by Slack et al. (1993). The HCDN contains river flows from 1874 to 1988, with an average record length of 44 years. The streamflow data included in the HCDN is purported to be relatively free from anthropogenic influences and the accuracy ratings of these records are at least rated good per USGS standards. A subset of the HCDN streamflow sites from 1337 watersheds with at least 10 years of record length was used. This subset includes 1376 HCDN sites.The climate characteristic estimates of temperature and precipitation were estimated using the PRISM (Daly et al. 1994, 1997) climate analysis system as described in Vogel, et al. 1999.Estimates of monthly potential evaporation were obtained using a method introduced by Hargreaves and Samani (1982) which is based on monthly time series of average minimum and maximum temperature data along with extraterrestrial solar radiation. Extraterrestrial solar radiation was estimated for each HCDN basin by computing the solar radiation over 0.1 degree grids using the method introduced by Duffie and Beckman (1980) and then summing those estimates for each river basin. This process is described in Sankarasubramanian, Vogel, and Limbrunner, 2001.The data files are organized in directories by parameter, Tmax, Tmin, Pre, and PET, and contain 18 subdirectories representing the 18 HCDN regions. Each region subdirectory contains data files for the monthly time series of respective hydroclimate attributes (Tmax, Tmin, Precipitation, and PET) for the individual HCDN sites in that region for the years 1951-1990. All files are in space delimited ASCII format.* [Exploring the Model Design Space for Battery Health Management](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fu3n-xfj9) - Battery Health Management (BHM) is a core enabling technology for the success and widespread adoption of the emerging electric vehicles of today. Although battery chemistries have been studied in detail in literature, an accurate run-time battery life prediction algorithm has eluded us. Current reliability-based techniques are insufficient to manage the use of such batteries when they are an active power source with frequently varying loads in uncertain environments. The amount of usable charge of a battery for a given discharge profile is not only dependent on the starting state-of-charge (SOC), but also other factors like battery health and the discharge or load profile imposed. This paper presents a Particle Filter (PF) based BHM framework with plug-and-play modules for battery models and uncertainty management. The batteries are modeled at three different levels of granularity with associated uncertainty distributions, encoding the basic electrochemical processes of a Lithium-polymer battery. The effects of different choices in the model design space are explored in the context of prediction performance in an electric unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) application with emulated flight profiles.* [Frequency Up-Conversion Detection System with Single Photon Sensitivity within 1-1.8 μm and 3-4 μm for ASCENDS Mission: A Novel Approach to Lidar, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7vt3-mpzm) - PI at ArkLight proposes to implement photon counting detectors at near-IR (1-1.8 microns) and mid-IR (3-4 microns) with single photon sensitivity based on frequency up-conversion during Phase 2, representing an innovative Lidar technology for ASCENDS mission. By working with Prof. Ding at Lehigh University, PI will explore fundamental limits to quantum efficiencies for up-conversion detection at 1.57 microns. She will implement, characterize, and optimize single up-conversion device capable of detecting 1.57 microns and 1.27 microns. She plans to achieve detections of CO2 and O2 using implemented up-conversion device. She will investigate fundamental limits to noises for up-conversion detections. She will compare among PPLN, PPKTP, and PPLT as up-conversion media. She will expand detection wavelengths to cover ranges of 1-1.8 microns and 3-4 microns. She plans to introduce novel techniques for improving performances of up-conversion devices. She will investigate versatility of up-conversion devices under harsh environments. To achieve all these objectives, she has laid out a detailed work plan describing all the specific tasks necessary. Through optimizations, she will achieve the quantum efficiency of 50%, dark count rate of 50 Hz, bandwidth of GHz, electrical consumption of < 1 W, weight of < 1 lb, and dimension of 7x4x4 (all in inches).* [One-Meter Class Drilling for Planetary Exploration, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pu5b-94nz) - The purpose of the proposed effort is to understand and characterize the fundamental limitations of drilling one to three meters into challenging materials which may be encountered in robotic drilling in situ planetary missions. The one-to-three meter range has been identified as a critical regime for planetary exploration; e.g., for potentially identifying subsurface organic material on Mars or polar resource deposits on the Moon. While there has been some technology development in planetary subsurface access, there is currently no surefire flight-like approach to robotically getting to this depth through layers of material like rock (most challenging being basalt), regolith, and icy mixtures. 
In Phase 1, we will experimentally identify the relative utility of rotary vs. rotary percussive drilling in the most challenging target materials under a variety of operational parameters, and extrapolate these results to three meters. Thus far there has been no apples-to-apples comparison of rotary vs. rotary-percussive drilling in this depth regime, though it is believed that rotary-percussive drilling has many advantages over rotary drilling including better penetration in hard targets. This will be a very test-heavy program. We will minimize costs by using an already available test rig - our one-of-a-kind one-meter class lunar drilling platform with rotary and rotary-percussive capability. This is an instrumented rig so we can measure system health and reactions back into the platform and we have the ability to vary drilling operational parameters to test the limits of the system. We will perform tests in Mars and lunar simulant, also readily available in our extensive library of planetary analog materials. Using the lessons learned from Phase 1 and Honeybee Robotics' 13+ years experience in subsurface access and sampling, in Phase 2 we will build a 1-3 meter drill capable of penetrating a representative 3 meter test column of layered Mars and/or lunar simulant.* [Simulating Emerging Space Industries with Agent-Based Modeling, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7rhi-d7zz) - The Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) calls for encouraging commercial participation as a top-level objective. Given current and future commercial activities, how should the government satisfy this objective? How can simulation of future companies determine the most likely to emerge? This innovation seeks to answer such questions envisioning a diverse set of four possible future space companies (orbital habitats/hotels, orbital tourist delivery, propellant depots, lunar excursion tourism, and lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization), examining their business case in spreadsheet-based models (both deterministically and probabilistically), modeling them in a higher fidelity agent-based modeling (ABM) environment (that is new to the aerospace industry but has been used by the authors of the proposal), determining the impact on a company's financial bottom-line, and finding potential cost savings to the government of using those products and services in future space exploration activities. Phase I will entail basic research of each of the four of case studies (or companies) as they are referred to here, spreadsheet-based modeling and analysis of each case study, and preliminary definition of the behaviors required for agent-based modeling. Phase II will entail development of a high fidelity, agent-based model of each company, their competitors, and their customers (commercial and the government).* [Constellation C3I Crew-Ground-Experimenter-Developer Collaboration Services, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f48a-2x6n) - The Command, Control, Communications and Information (C3I) environment will be significantly different for Constellation than for Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS).  Missions will operate not only in Near Earth round-trip latencies (RTLT) of seconds but also Near Mars RTLT of 10 to 40 minutes.  New classes of collaboration services are required to support the spectrum of Constellation missions and infrastructure.  Integrating popular collaboration tools such as Groove Virtual Office on Constellation C3I space-based components and networks will be a major innovation.  This project proposes experimental use in SBIR Phases II/III of ISS flight and ground capabilities to demonstrate new collaboration services for use in the Constellation program.  These new space-based and terrestrial services will greatly improve communications among all Constellation personnel over current techniques.  The approach includes:  1) Integrate instant messaging, e-mail, transcription, etc. with voice and video communications; 2) Design for automation and autonomy of space-based Constellation components; 3) Evolve development collaboration services into mission collaboration services over time; 4) Promote new collaboration standards, interoperability, standardized interfaces, and modularity; 5) Adapt the collaboration architecture to the ground and space networks and frameworks.  Client-server, peer-to-peer, or a hybrid architecture may be most suitable.* [Crystal Growth of New Radiation Detector Materials in Microgravity, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ggjv-zapm) - RMD proposes to conduct a series of crystal growth experiments on the International Space Station in the SUBSA furnace inside the MSG glovebox to grow crystals of new materials that have shown a good radiation detector response and present a commercial interest. There is a great demand for spectroscopic gamma-ray detectors capable of not only detecting presence and intensity of radiation, but also distinguishing the energy of an emitting isotope with high resolution. Another market is for solid-state neutron detection and dosimetry, where crystals can replace the difficult to obtain 3He gas. RMD is currently researching several detector crystals that have been developed to that stage: TlBr, SrI2:Eu, and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA). These are detector materials of different types for specific applications: TlBr is a semiconductor for gamma-ray detection, SrI2:Eu is a scintillator for gamma-ray detection, and DPA is an organic scintillator for neutron detection.
Crystal growth of these materials presents a number of challenges which limit the yield of high quality crystals or degrade their detector properties. The proposed microgravity research project will focus on developing a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern defect formation during crystal growth of these materials, and correlating those mechanisms to detector properties.
RMD assembled a strong team of experts with significant experience in crystal growth and materials research in microgravity, who are very familiar with the equipment to be utilized for this project. Despite whether our hypotheses are confirmed or disproven, this series of crystal growth experiments in microgravity would allow us to determine which process parameters have the largest impact on quality and yield without interference from convection, in order to focus on optimization of those parameters, for improved production on Earth.* [High Integrity GPS Solution for Trusted Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/m839-w582) - Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) is the most CSWaP compatible safety solution for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and will be mandated for use by the FAA in the National Airspace System (NAS) by 2020. The ongoing miniaturization efforts will continue to enable a cooperative approach to the integration of UAS into NAS moving forward.  A critical limitation of ADS-B is the use of GPS-derived position vector in its broadcast, which can be easily spoofed or jammed, or confused by reflections in urban areas.  We present a low-CSWaP solution to secure and verify the GPS integrity using a novel antenna design so that ADS-B can be used as a trusted vehicle to vehicle communications and navigation link for UAS.* [Bringing 3D Memory Cubes to Space: a "Rad-Hard by Design Study" with an Open Architecture, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mnj3-aex8) - The computing capabilities of onboard spacecraft are a major limiting factor for accomplishing many classes of future missions. Although technology development efforts are underway that will provide improvements to spacecraft CPUs, they do not address the limitations of current onboard memory systems. In addition to CPU upgrades, effective execution of data-intensive operations such as terrain relative navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning and scheduling, and onboard science data processing and analysis require high-bandwidth, low-latency memory systems to maximize processor usage (the ?memory wall?) and provide rapid access to observational data captured by high-data-rate instruments (e.g., Hyperspectral Infrared Imager, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar).
3D ICs, after a long wait, is now a reality. The first mainstream product is 3D memory cubes, where multiple memory tiers (4 DRAM tiers as of 2015) are vertically integrated to offer manifold improvement in size, capacity, speed, and power consumption compared with 2D counterparts. Indeed, these are the memory parts that will truly enable aforementioned missions. Unfortunately, none of these are ready for space. The purpose of this research is to investigate the challenges and opportunities in deploying 3D memory cubes into space missions.* [Milliarcsecond Small Spacecraft Attitude Control System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hww9-abuy) - Busek proposes to develop a highly modular attitude control system (ACS) which will provide orders of magnitude improvements over state-of-the-art alternative ACS for CubeSats. The low inertia of CubeSats combined with vibrational disturbances and resolution limitations of state-of-the-art ACS presently limit body-pointing and position control accuracy. Busek's electrospray thrusters aboard the ESA LISA Pathfinder spacecraft recently demonstrated precision control at nm scales; this work extends that success to CubeSat platforms. Passively fed electrospray thrusters are highly compact, including fully integrated propellant supplies, and are capable of ~100nN thrust at 10's of nN noise. Thrust can be throttled over >25x, to a scalable maximum of 10's of uN.  These traits, combined with >1200s Isp enable these systems to replace traditional reaction wheel ACS; improving pointing error from arcsecs to 10's of milliarcsec. This work addresses critical development gaps, in both thruster-heads and a multi-axis power processing unit with integrated firmware, presently gating the technology. Phase I will focus on establishing a baseline set of data and methodologies permitting detailed verification of the technology and definition of development gaps. The output of existing designs will be scaled to target ACS applicable performance in Task 1, culminating in assembly of two thrusters. A precisely measured performance map including thrust range, resolution and noise will be measured in Task 2 from both thruster heads. Those data will permit PPU system requirements to be defined and will feed development of control laws to be evaluated, in Task 3, using a hardware-in-the-loop precision pointing test apparatus. Electronics requirements will be assessed against existing single-axis architectures and new HV converter measurements in Task 4, along with identification of thruster head development needs; establishing a path towards a full system development in Phase II.* [Micro-Electro-Analytical Sensor for Sensitive, Selective and Rapid Monitoring of Hydrazine in the Presence of Ammonia, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/id7b-c2xy) - Hydrazine, a volatile and flammable colorless liquid, is classified as a carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency. It can cause chromosome aberrations and negatively affect the lungs, liver, spleen, thyroid gland, and central nervous system. NASA's existing hydrazine measurement technology is sensitive, selective and reliable, but it takes 15 minutes to collect and analyze a sample. For future missions beyond Low Earth Orbit, NASA will need a measurement system that responds within 30 seconds without any performance limitations such as lack of specificity and maintenance challenges. To address NASA needs, InnoSense LLC (ISL) proposes to develop micro-electro-analytical sensor for rapid monitoring of hydrazine (Micro-Zin) in the presence of ammonia in spacecraft cabin atmosphere (SCA) for long-term performance without maintenance. Micro-Zin builds on ISL's nanomaterial-based sensor technology and electronic data processing systems. In Phase I, ISL will design and fabricate a Micro-Zin working model. To establish feasibility, we will characterize Micro-Zin's sensitivity, selectivity, response time, and reliability. In Phase II, we will optimize sensor performance with an appropriate prototype.* [Nimbus-7 SMMR Polar Gridded Radiances and Sea Ice Concentrations](https://data.nasa.gov/d/96kz-tb2m) - This data set contains gridded brightness temperatures and sea ice concentrations for both polar regions. It spans the period from October 1978 through August 1987, when the Nimbus-7 SMMR scanner was turned off. The data were collected every other day at 6.60, 10.69, 18.00, 21.00 and 37.00 GHz. Due to spacecraft power limitations, the scanner operated only on alternate days. There are usually at least foutreen days of coverage per month, although major data gaps occurred during the month of August. In August 1982, the following days are missing for both polar regions: 4th, 8th, and 16th; in August 1984, the 13th through the 23rd are missing for both polar regions; and in August 1985, the 6th through 8th are missing for the Southern Hemisphere.

Brightness temperature and sea ice concentration grids have 25 x 25 km grid elements in polar stereographic projection. Volume 7 contains all SMMR sea ice concentrations for both polar regions, plus five months of brightness temperature grids for the North polar region.

Brightness temperature grids are stored as 16-bit integers, one day of brightness temperature data is 0.27 mbytes for the North polar region, 0.21 mbytes for the South. Ice grids are stored as 8-bit integers. Files contain 136192 bytes and 104912 bytes for the North and South respectively. The NASA Team Algorithm (Cavalieri et al. 1984, Gloersen and Cavalieri 1986) was used to calculate ice concentrations from the brightness temperatures. The data were produced by Dr. P. Gloersen, NASA/GSFC, Oceans and Ice Branch, and are available via FTP.

Notice to Data Users: SMMR TCT tapes comprised the input data set, unlike the SMMR Digital Media product distributed by NSIDC in 1979.* [Natural Resource Protection and Child Health Indicators, 2012 Release](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qgw3-qctw) - The Natural Resource Protection and Child Health Indicators, 2012 Release, are produced in support of the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation as selection criteria for funding eligibility. These indicators are successors to the Natural Resource Management Index (NRMI), which was produced from 2006 to 2011 and was based on the same underlying data. Like the NRMI, the Natural Resource Protection Indicator (NRPI) and Child Health Indicator (CHI) are based on proximity-to-target scores ranging from 0 to 100 (at target). The NRPI covers 235 countries and is calculated based on the weighted average percentage of biomes under protected status. The CHI is a composite index for 175 countries derived from the average of three proximity-to-target scores for access to improved sanitation, access to improved water, and child mortality. The 2012 release includes a consistent time series of NRPIs and CHIs for 2006 to 2012. (Suggested Usage: To assist in the country selection process for the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) by providing indicators of natural resource protection and child health that complements the governance, social, and economic indicators used by MCC as country selection criteria.)* [IMAGING OF JUPITER ASSOCIATED WITH SL9 IMPACT FLASHES](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sadd-rgt7) - A global imaging campaign (GIC) was organized at sites during the impact of comet Shoemaker-levy 9 with Jupiter. These five sites were Queensland in Australia, the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, Lick Observatory, Mauna Kea Observatory and Reunion Island. All sites used a combination of high speed optical CCD systems with similar broad and narrow band filters.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Time Average 1-hourly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w25t-gfay) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

  The MERRA-Land product, MST1NXMLD or tavg1_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional time averaged single-level at the native resolution. All collections from this group are at reduced horizontal resolution. 
  
    The data are on the GEOS-5 native 540 x 361 grid with 2/3&deg; longitude x 1/2&deg; latitude resolution. Data are archived in the HDF-EOS (Grid) format, based on HDF4.* [Metal Vaccro, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7djc-r7z3) - NASA has determined that the use of modular and reconfigurable components is critical for the success of future large and complex space systems.   In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to be able to assemble and reassemble modules both on the ground and on orbit.  Therefore, it requires a means to join components that is simple, reliable, and non-intrusive as well as strong and stiff enough to withstand multiple connections and disconnections.  AeroAstro?s solution is to apply a new micro-scale mechanical joining technology, Vaccro, to the modular space systems.  Created by VACCO Industries, Vaccro is analogous to ?metal Velcro? in that two surfaces will mechanically adhere to each other upon contact.  Depending on the type of Vaccro used, these bonds can be either permanent or reversible.  With this technology, the surfaces of space system components and modules would be micro-machined with Vaccro features during the ground fabrication process.  With slightly different channel geometries, the surfaces can be peeled apart and rejoined, or they can be made such that the surfaces lock together permanently.  AeroAstro along with VACCO Industries, proposes to determine the specifications for and material qualities of a space suitable Vaccro product.* [Poverty Mapping Project: Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4mne-umwu) - The Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition dataset consists of estimates of the   percentage of children with weight-for-age z-scores that are more than two standard deviations below the median of the NCHS/CDC/WHO   International Reference Population. Data are reported for the most recent year with subnational information available at the time of   development. The data products include a shapefile (vector data) of percentage rates, grids (raster data) of rates (per thousand in   order to preserve precision in integer format), the number of children under five (the rate denominator), and the number of   underweight children under five (the rate numerator), and a tabular dataset of the same and associated data. This dataset is produced   by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Three-Dimensional Health Monitoring of Sandwich Composites, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wzim-4gbj) - This SBIR project delivers a single-chip structural health-monitoring (SHM) system that uses the impedance method to monitor bulk interiors and wave propagation methods to assess surfaces. This Three-Dimensional Health Monitoring (3DHM) unit supports nondestructive evaluation (NDE) systems and evaluates hard shell composites that include sandwich structures.

Implications of the innovation
Increasingly demanding weight and performance needs move manufacturers to the use of composite materials. New systems are needed to detect incipient damage in composites and identify aging-related hazards before they become critical. Three-dimensional health analyzers that actively examine both bulk interiors and large-scale surface areas address a major problem domain; however, no practical system exists. We address this deficiency by building on our existing SHM system.

Technical objectives
3DHM leverages our previous NASA research in SHM. Our current prototype takes the form of a single custom printed circuit board, and is a TRL 5 unit. We have demonstrated bulk interior and limited surface area coverage in Boeing thermal protection system (TPS) tests and on wind turbine blades--both feature composite materials. We extend our surface coverage by adding wave propagation SHM. Our sensor validation includes computer modeling that generates virtual (simulated) data.

Research description
Phase 1 establishes feasibility for a single-chip approach that combines the impedance method and wave propagation, and demonstrates damage detection on a model composite. Phase 2 completes, validates and demonstrates single chip operation, and delivers an operational unit.

Anticipated results
Phase 1 establishes 3DHM feasibility by developing a detailed chip development and verification roadmap. Phase 2 delivers an operational unit that monitors and assesses bulk interiors and surfaces of hard shell composites that include sandwich structures.* [Experimental and Analytical Development of a Health Management System for Electro-Mechanical Actuators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3rqh-42g6) - Expanded deployment of Electro-Mechanical Actuators (EMAs) in critical applications has created much interest in EMA Prognostic Health Management (PHM), a key enabling technology of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM). As such, Impact Technologies, LLC is collaborating with the NASA Ames Research Center to perform a number of research efforts in support of NASA’s Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) initiatives. These efforts have combined experimental test stand development, laboratory seeded fault testing, and physical model-based health monitoring in a comprehensive PHM
system development strategy. This paper discusses two closely related EMA research programs being conducted by
Impact and NASA Ames. The first of these efforts resulted in the creation of an electro-mechanical actuator test stand for the Prognostics Center of Excellence at the NASA Ames Research Center. The second effort is ongoing and is utilizing physics-based modeling techniques to develop an algorithm and software package toolset for PHM of aircraft EMA systems using a hybrid (virtual sensor) approach.* [Hydrogen Recovery System, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2aqx-29cy) - Rocket test operations at NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC) result in substantial quantities of hydrogen gas that is flared from the facility and helium gas that is vented.  One way to save on the cost of test operations is to recover these gases using an electrochemical system.  This Hydrogen Recovery System (HRS) selectively removes hydrogen from the mixed stream, leaving behind high-value helium.  The system then removes residual water vapor from this helium and compresses it to commercial storage pressure.  The heart of the HRS is a system platform under commercial development by Sustainable Innovations, termed H2RENEW<SUP>TM</SUP>, an electrochemical system package that separates and compresses hydrogen using Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology.  The system being developed in this Phase II STTR program targets a hydrogen removal rate of 1.77 scfm, an outlet hydrogen pressure of 200 psi, and a product helium pressure of 2,000  2,500 psi.  This system leverages a robust novel Expandable Modular Architecture (EMA) electrochemical cell stack that is capable of being constructed with a very large production capacity and high operating pressure.* [Carbon Nanotube Infused Launch Vehicle Structures](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f6vf-8spc) - <p>For the past 5 years Orbital ATK has been investing in, prototyping, and testing carbon nanotube infused composite structures to evaluate their impact on launch vehicle structural damping. Improvements to structural damping would be revolutionary to launch vehicle design.</p><p>For any vehicle a significant portion of design, material, and integration efforts center on mitigating the severe dynamic environments seen during flight. This includes launch acoustics, random vibration, sinusoidal vibration, and shock. Acoustics are driven by high frequency pressure fluctuations associated with motor firing or the launch vehicle quickly passing through the atmosphere. This induces responses and stress in structures and components. During launch random vibration from aero-acoustics also induces stresses to hardware (e.g. components, as pieces, move relative to each other) risking failure both due to magnitude and fatigue. Sinusoidal vibration, usually (but not always) related to motor chamber pressure resonance during burn, can couple with a component or structure&rsquo;s natural frequency &ndash;magnifying the vibration and posing significant structural and hardware risk. Lastly, short high magnitude shock events also occur at the ignition of each motor stage and at each stage&rsquo;s pyrotechnic separation event. Shock poses significant technical risk and is a common driver for launch vehicle design requirements.</p><p>Testing to date by the Orbital ATK Launch Vehicle Division (LVD) has shown that by infusing CNT into composite we can improve the structural damping by a factor of 2x. Improved damping attenuates launch dynamic environments which leads to cascading benefits if CNT&rsquo;s are infused into all primary and secondary structures. The improved damping lowers transient dynamic loads in primary structures and reduces secondary structure dynamic response. This allows reduction of primary and secondary structural mass. Moreover shock and random vibration are reduced into components which may allow for the elimination of hardware isolation systems. With no isolation required on hundreds of components (including the payload), a significant amount of &ldquo;parasitic mass&rdquo; can be eliminated. The significant reduction in part quantity and design complexity produces cascading material, design, test, and integration cost savings and expedites program schedules. A case study on Orbital ATK launch vehicles shows elimination of parasitic mass enabled through CNT utilization could increase payload mass to orbit by &gt;10% and reduce launch vehicle cost by &gt;15%. Dynamic loads and environments into the spacecraft are also decreased&mdash;enabling reduction in payload structural mass, associated propellant mass, and reduce spacecraft test environments.</p><p>CNT infused launch vehicle structures are at a tipping point enabling breakthrough improvement in structural damping. CNT&rsquo;s efficacy improving damping has been shown at a coupon level in a lab environment (TRL 4). A two phased approach will mature this technology further. Phase I advances TRL to level 5 by building subsystem level prototypes and executing flight-like testing. CNT infused composites will be prototyped and tested in two independent configurations: CNT sheets interstitially layered in pre-impregnated (pre-preg) composite, and chopped CNT&rsquo;s dispersed into composite. Phase II advances TRL to level 6 by building full-scale flight structures and completing end to end testing (ground and/or flight tests). Flight structures include a CNT sounding rocket interstage and a palletized CNT lattice bulkhead for a major launch vehicle. Orbital ATK is the prime contractor for the NASA Sounding Rocket Operations Contract (NSROC) program. Zero-cost rideshare opportunities to fly the CNT interstage will be pursued on best effort basis through the NSROC program. Results of this two-phased approach will demonstrate the safety, robustness, and cascading benefits of CN* [Vibration Energy Harvesting for SHM Sensors, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ypps-m6fc) - Wireless sensors show enormous promise for safety improvements and cost reductions in monitoring the structural health of aircraft and spacecraft.  A significant challenge for wireless sensors is power.  Because of the labor and associated costs associated with changing hundreds, if not thousands of batteries, combined with the fact that many will be deployed in inaccessible locations, these systems will have to rely on harvesting energy from the environment to provide long-lived power.  

TPL and Washington State University (WSU) propose to develop a vibrational energy harvesting system based on the P3 (Palouse Piezo Power) Micropower Generator.  The P3 is a patented, MEMS-based, piezoelectric membrane generator that has been demonstrated to operate over 1 billion cycles.  In this effort, TPL will team with WSU researchers to develop a microfabricated proof mass for coupling vibrational energy into the piezoelectric membrane and to develop packaging for the device so it can be deployed in real world situations. 

Combined with TPL's patented microbatteries and microsupercapacitors for energy storage, the proposed system will provide a stand-alone power source that does not need recharging or refueling for wireless structural health monitoring (SHM) systems.* [A Pulsed Nonlinear Raman Detection of Trace Organics with SERS Enhanced Sensitivity, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j2pa-7cax) - A significant technology gap for NASA astrobiology missions is the detection of organics at the sub ppm level without sampling.  Currently, NASA uses different sensing technologies such as Pyrolysis&#150;GCMS to analyze planetary samples. These instruments require complex sample handling and can process only a limited number of samples.  It is critical to develop an effective instrument with extended and enhanced capabilities to enable future planetary multiple-mission needs. We propose to develop a new nonlinear Raman spectral sensing technology for trace organic detection at the sub ppm level.  The proposed technology will provide significantly increased sensitivity based on nonlinear Raman detection with Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). It eliminates the sample preparation process, contamination and other related accessories. Our test samples will be soils from the Mojave, and Antarctic Dry Valley deserts which have measured organic concentrations of 10 to 250 ppm. We will mix unaltered soils with organics removed soils.  The detection of organics at the sub ppm level without sampling will be applicable to several future NASA missions, in particular future rovers for the upcoming Mars 2020 mission.   These mobile, fast and agile rovers are focused on collection for sample return and require non-sampling analytical instruments.* [Unsteady Simulation of Dual-Mode Transition Flows Using a Hybrid LES/RANS Approach with Improved Sub-Grid Scale Models](https://data.nasa.gov/d/98wi-8kkw) - Space access today is via rocket-launched vehicles like the Space Shuttle. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the propulsion systems, and the need to carry on-board oxidizer, these launch vehicles have small payload fractions. This limitation indicates a real need for the development of revolutionary launch technologies for space access. Leading candidates for next generation launch vehicles include two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) concepts utilizing advanced hypersonic air-breathing propulsion for the first stage. However, the successful design and operation of such vehicles is hindered by a fundamental lack of predictive capability of the high-speed turbulent combustion processes occurring through the ramjet-to-scramjet flight regime. Only after researchers successfully address this fundamental inadequacy can advanced hypersonic air-breathing technologies be used to revolutionize means of space access.

This research plan aims to develop advanced computational models for predicting flow conditions within a scramjet engine as it transitions through the ramjet-to-scramjet dual-mode regime. Development of these models will be achieved by answering two primary research questions of interest: (1) how can the wide range of flow scales occurring during dual-mode transition be modeled with sufficient accuracy to capture the relevant turbulent flow and combustion physics, and (2) how can the advanced models be implemented within existing computational frameworks for minimal runtimes? This proposal leverages existing developmental frameworks, in addition to developing novel models and methods, to answer these questions. Answering the first question relies on expanding state-of-the-art models like Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and the flamelet generated manifold (FGM) approach. The primary deficiency of LES is insufficient sub-grid scale (SGS) models for the flow regime of interest, and the FGM approach is currently incapable of predicting pressure-dependent combustion physics. This research aims to develop joint probability density function (PDF) SGS models to achieve the necessary accuracy of the flow physics and to develop an FGM approach incorporating pressure effects. This LES/PDF/FGM approach will be used to model flow away from the wall, whereas a hybrid LES/Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approach will be used near the flowpath wall. The answer to the second question relies on leveraging the VULCAN computational fluid dynamics framework to implement the LES/PDF/FGM and hybrid LES/RANS approaches in a cost-effective and timely manner. Long runtimes plague advanced simulations of dual-mode transition and other high-speed turbulent reacting flows; however, this research aims to incorporate these models into VULCAN in an extensible manner using novel algorithms that will accommodate later generation models. The research proposed herein aims to develop a complete understanding of the dual-mode transition flow process and upon doing so, advance the development of revolutionary means of space access. Not only will this research benefit development of TSTO concepts, but it will also benefit the NASA flow physics modeling community at large. By developing the LES/FDF/FGM model within an established NASA framework, like VULCAN, the resulting capabilities will be made widely available. This ease of access will lead to applications of this approach in areas outside of its initial region of inception. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the proposed research represents a key step in achieving NASA's Space Technology goal and one of the most important Space Technology Grand Challenge: Economical Space Access. Understanding and modeling dual-mode transition flow physics is a pressing hurdle that must be overcome before TSTO hypersonic air-breathing technologies can be used to revolutionize the nation's means of affordable and sustainable space access.* [Integrated Stack and Advanced MEAs for High-Yield, Long-Life Helium Reclamation System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2u9c-g44e) - Gaseous helium reclamation is critical in reducing operating costs at rocket engine test facilities.  Increases in cost and potential shortages of helium will dramatically impact testing of rocket engines for launch vehicles and space propulsion systems as the global supply of this non-renewable element diminishes.  Sierra Lobo (SLI) has developed an advanced electrochemical Helium Recovery System (HRS), but has identified membrane longevity as a key limitation in the commercialization and deployment of the technology.  FuelCellsEtc has teamed with SLI to address these issues.  FCE will use their extensive technical expertise in Membrane Electrode Assembly design and manufacturing as well as stack hardware design to address the two primary limitations to the existing HRS technology: Longevity and Throughput.  The Phase I effort will identify, test and verify an Advanced MEA based on the particular operating parameters of the HRS.  In addition, preliminary stack designs will be initiated which will increase the throughput capability of the HRS by an estimated 10x.  These improvements will increase the TRL from 4 to 5 in Phase I and from 5 to 7/8 by the end of Phase II.* [LIBS Testing in a Venus Environment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6bzb-haun) - <p>Demonstrate the feasibility of Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) in a high temperature, high pressure, CO2 environment analogous to the conditions near the surface of Venus. Develop quantitative constraints on the capabilities and limitations of LIBS in a Venus surface environment.<p/><p>Configure LIBS system to view samples in the Venus chamber Confirm STP results for LIBS in Venus Chamber configuration Conduct high temperature/high pressure experiments on Columbia River Basalt.</p>* [VEGA1 INFRARED SPECTROMETER HIGH RESOLUTION DATA V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hvv5-axns) - The IKS data from Vega-1 came in various forms. The initial submission from IKI by Dyachkov was in GROUP FITS (binary) for the 'imaging channel'. A separate submission came through the IHW Infrared Studies Discipline and also contained data presented in the FITS format (IHW keywords) for the two 'infrared channels'. In the former case, the three Pvalues carried information on the distance and two angles used to locate the position of the comet on the slit. The other simple keyword values marked only the date, mission, and experiment. The latter data, had not only 101 individual spectra for the 3-5 micron measurements but a composite 'final' 6-12 micron spectrum with associated 'figure 7' from the published results (COMBES, M. et al. 1988, Icarus, 76, 404). For these 101 spectra a cometo-centric distance was quoted rather than a time micron data. Using this information, the distance range was 270534.9 to 39273.22 km. From this comparison, it is inferred that the distance quoted in the IKI submission is also cometo-centric (31596.0 to 16092 km)* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Reflectivity Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/imcn-vqd2) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Reflectivity Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

The grids have a resolution of 30 arc-seconds (0.0083 decimal degrees), or approximately 1 square km. The gridded variables are based on census block geography from Census 2000 TIGER/Line Files and census variables (income, poverty, education, housing age). This dataset is produced by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Blade Vibration Measurement System for Characterization of Closely Spaced Modes and Mistuning, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/prjn-sbvd) - There are several ongoing challenges in non-contacting blade vibration and stress measurement systems that can address closely spaced modes and blade-to-blade variations (mistuning).  Traditional NSMS systems are applicable but have limitations due to the undersampling that is inherent in time-of-arrival data processing and the uncertainty that is introduced by inferring, as opposed to calculating, the mode of vibration.  

Based on Navy SBIR research, MSI is developing a radar-based blade vibration measurement system with the following capabilities:
• Provides a continuous time series of blade displacement data over a portion of a revolution (solving the undersampling problem).
• Includes data reduction algorithms to directly calculate the blade vibration frequency, modal displacement, and vibratory stress (solving the mode inference problem).
• Uses a single sensor per stage to monitor all of the blades on the stage.

The goals for the proposed project are to design and construct an innovative blade vibration measurement system with resolution capable of characterizing mistuning parameters and closely spaced modes of vibration.  Development and demonstration of such a system will provide substantially superior capabilities to current blade vibration technology.  Phase I demonstration testing will be conducted in MSI's laboratory with an existing instrumented compressor rig.* [Development of Non-Contact Trace Contamination Detection Methods and Instrumentation for Spacecraft Cleaning Validation Using Deep UV Chemical Imaging, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pzzm-4dxx) - This proposal addresses the need for advanced analytical methods and instrumentation to detect trace levels of chemical and biological contaminants directly on spacecraft and related surfaces to comply with Contamination Control and Planetary Protection requirements in an effort to preserve sample science integrity for life detection investigations on Europa, Enceladus, Mars, etc.  The proposed methods employ non-contact deep UV Raman and fluorescence chemical imaging and mapping methods to avoid the need for any contact with spacecraft and related surfaces.  The method eliminates the use of traditional sample collection methods such as swabs, wipes, or other methods, which have been shown to back-contaminate spacecraft surfaces as well as collected samples.  
   Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy with excitation in the deep UV below 250 nm enables separation of the spectral regions of both Raman and fluorescence emissions, enabling collection of Raman emissions without obscuration by fluorescence from chemicals of interest as well as many spacecraft materials and from trace organic contamination within field of view of the Raman detection optics.  This cannot be accomplished with excitation at longer wavelength including 263 nm or 266 nm from 4th harmonic Nd based lasers.  
   Combining Raman and fluorescence methods in the deep UV enhances the ability to detect and identify the trace chemical or biological materials on these surfaces and have a proven ability to detect biological and other particles and materials on surfaces less than 1 pg, the mass of a single bacterial spore, with dimensions as small as 200 nm.  These methods were first developed under funding from NASA Planetary Protection, but were advanced by contracts with several Department of Defense organizations well as commercial developments with both Pfizer Pharmaceutical and DuPont for chemical and biological cleaning validation of their manufacturing equipment.* [Improving Communication Throughput with Retrodirective Arrays for CubeSat Applications](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8x4r-548w) - The purpose of this project will be to investigate and propose solutions regarding the development of retrodirective arrays (RDA) for CubeSat applications. As an end result, this project aims to improve information throughput with the design of a RDA that meets the strict power and size requirements of CubeSats and other small satellites. This project is a part of a larger ongoing research and development program for advanced CubeSat communications systems involving multiple thesis projects at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. 

The retrodirective antenna array provides autonomous steering of the beam pattern so that the antenna points itself in the direction of arrival (DOA) of a signal source. This will improve satellites antenna pointing abilities without requiring highly accurate attitude determination and control. The end result is an improvement in information throughput by optimizing the power received at the ground station. This technology has already been implemented on a larger scale, and so the purpose of this project will be to miniaturize the technology to meet the needs of smaller satellites.  RDAs offer the potential for increasing received power during satellite downlink and improved information throughput. This is directly relevant to NASA technology area 5.2.6, and has widespread applications beyond the CubeSat platform.  

Numerous challenges and limitations must be overcome before RDA technology is ready to be functionally implemented on a CubeSat.. The primary objective of this project is to optimize the design and prototype a functional RDA architecture for CubeSat platforms.* [Optimal Electric Field Estimation for Exoplanet Imaging Observatories in Space](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n9i9-mntc) - The discovery and characterization of Earth-like planets around other stars is a high priority in modern astronomy. While over 900 confirmed exoplanets have been discovered, all but a handful were found by indirect means such as stellar transits and radial velocity. Direct imaging is the only way to study the composition and habitability of exoplanets. The challenge of direct imaging is to prevent diffracted starlight from overwhelming the light of a dim exoplanet. As an example, the Earth is about 10 billion (1e-10) times dimmer than the Sun in visible light; for a Hubble-size telescope 10 parsecs away, the Earth would be about 1e-8 times dimmer than the diffracted starlight at the same location. A coronagraph can be used to reduce diffracted starlight in the area of the image where the planet may exist, which is called the search area. However, even the highest quality optics in a static system have aberrations that prevent better than about 1e-7 contrast between an exoplanet and its star. Therefore, all high-contrast imaging systems are designed with one or more deformable mirrors (DMs), which can actively correct these quasi-static aberrations and recover contrast in sub-regions of the search area known as dark holes. Unlike in ground-based adaptive optics (AO) systems that use a dichroic beamsplitter and a dedicated wavefront sensor to correct for atmospheric turbulence, the science camera at the focal plane must double as the wavefront sensor in high-contrast imaging to avoid non-common path aberrations.

Current focal plane wavefront correction algorithms are not ready for use in space. The main priority to date has been to reach as high a contrast as possible. Several groups have already demonstrated contrast at the 1e-9 to 1e-10 levels with various coronagraphs in the past decade. However, the development of estimation and control algorithms has slowed during that same period. A space telescope using current wavefront correction algorithms would use all or nearly all of its time just creating the dark holes for one or two stars. This is worrisome because NASA is in pre-Phase A of a coronagraph instrument for the Astrophysics Focused Telescope Asset (AFTA), so we urgently need improved wavefront correction routines. Existing, deterministic wavefront control algorithms are already suitable for a space mission, but they depend on wavefront estimation algorithms that are neither complete nor fast enough. 

My doctoral research is focused on advancing wavefront estimation algorithms to meet the needs of a space mission. Exoplanets are incoherent with their host stars, but wavefront estimation algorithms have so far not included estimation of these very objects that we wish to study. I am developing several algorithms that will provide optimal estimates of incoherent sources during the iterative wavefront correction routine. Previous wavefront correction routines have also assumed a static (that is, unchanging over the course of several images) system. Exoplanet exposures will take hours to days, however, so I am developing the first wavefront estimator that incorporates the dynamics of thermal flexing of a space telescope. I am developing these and other new wavefront estimation algorithms at Princeton, where I will test them in the High Contrast Imaging Laboratory with two DMs and a shaped pupil coronagraph. I will use our star-planet simulator to inject a dim, incoherent source into the optical system, and I will add heaters to parts of the optical bench to induce thermal flexing. Wavefront correction is necessary for any high-contrast imaging system, so my research has strong potential for collaboration with groups at various research centers across the country. By addressing the limitations identified by NASA in wavefront correction and high-contrast imaging, my theoretical and experimental research will enable space telescopes to detect and characterize Earth-like exoplanets.* [Portable Intravenous Fluid Production Device for Ground Use](https://data.nasa.gov/d/67yt-n6sq) - <p>There are several medical conditions require the administration of intravenous (IV) fluids, but limitations of mass, volume, shelf-life, transportation, and local resources can restrict the availability of these important fluids. Such limitations are expected in long-duration space exploration missions and in remote or austere places on Earth. Furthermore, current IV fluid production requires large factory-based processes. This device is easy to use, portable, and has the ability for onsite production of IV fluids that would eliminate these limitations.&nbsp;</p> <p>This design uses regular drinking water that is pumped through two filters to produce, in minutes, sterile, ultrapure water that meets the stringent quality standards of the United States Pharmacopeia for Water for Injection (Total Bacteria, Conductivity, Endotoxins, Total Organic Carbon).

In particular, our team will develop a concept design for an actively controlled ElectroMechanical Suspension (EMS) system, including algorithms, software and hardware, that dramatically improves mobility for MER to MSL scale rovers.  Our system exploits and adapts approximately $25M of highly successful active suspension R&D at CEM since 1993.  It also exploits CEM's experience developing electromechanical systems for space applications gained during NASA funded programs to develop flywheel energy storage system technology for the International Space Station.  Finally, it exploits our team's extensive experience migrating University technology to commercially viable manufacturable products.  Relevant features of our anticipated solution include:
•	Capable of vehicle speeds exceeding 3 m/s over lunar relevant terrain while maintaining hyper-stability for payloads of 100 kg or more

Although existing lightning locating systems can geolocate breakdown processes with accuracies of 10s of meters at heights above 1.5-2 km, they do not accurately report ground strike locations or provide estimates of current and charge transfer. In addition, conventional VLF/LF LLS networks do not currently report lightning channels descending towards or contacting ground with enough accuracy to address this problem. There is a need for a system that can improve location accuracy and detection efficiency. 
Under this NASA STTR program, QUASAR Federal Systems proposes to team with Professor Ken Cummins of the University of Arizona to develop a lightning detection sensor based on an SoA 6-axis EB vector sensor and unique location and characterization algorithm. 
In Phase I, we will perform a feasibility study of using a 6-axis EB sensor to address NASA "total lightning detection" needs in location accuracy and detection efficiency. This will include both analysis and limited field measurements. We will also identify a system architecture and key components for the Phase II prototype. In Phase II of the project, we will develop a scientific prototype to demonstrate the technology with field data.* [InGaAs Photomultiplier Chip photon counting array for 1550 nm operation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qbhm-m26p) - The development of a robust approach for Deep Space Optical Communications is critical to future space missions as communication bandwidth requirements are expected to dramatically increase due to continuing improvements in sensor spectral coverage and resolution.  Current solutions do not meet NASAs goals for sensitivity, timing resolution, and data rate.  Furthermore, many of the current solutions require cryocooling, which significantly impacts size, weight, and power, as well as reliability.  LightSpin Technologies proposes the development of a new generation of single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array devices to fulfill NASA requirements.  The innovation includes a new planar processing technology, enabling tight pitch SPAD arrays to be built, mitigating after pulsing and dead time limitations.  Furthermore, we propose to use InAlAs gain regions, which have significant advantages due to its avalanche breakdown characteristics and wider band gap compared to InP.  The net result at the end of Phase II will be a Photomultiplier Chip SPAD array device incorporating thousands of small area SPAD devices in parallel, enabling precision detection of single photons with sub 100 picosecond timing resolution and maximum count rates in excess of 10 Gcps.* [A Novel, Portable, Projection, Focusing Schlieren System, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tr6h-5qjc) - The schlieren technique has been used for flow diagnostics in wind tunnels since the beginning of aerospace research due to its ability to make airflows  especially shock waves and turbulence  visible. This proposal describes a novel type of schlieren system that would increase efficiency, capability, and productivity for ground test facilities. The concept and the availability of state-of-the-art components make the system more portable, easier to align, and more versatile than existing systems. A major drawback of current schlieren systems, and one that has restricted their widespread commercial use, is that they require exact alignment between a pair of widely separated mirrors or grids, which takes time and limits portability, and costs are prohibitive for most such applications. This problem is partially relaxed by focusing schlieren methods. The proposed concept incorporates features of existing schlieren systems while removing the primary limitations. All of the elements that require precise alignment are contained within a camera body and can be relatively inexpensive. Very large fields of view are made possible. This is advantageous in wind tunnel facilities, since experiments are frequently installed only to be torn down shortly afterwards.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_final](https://data.nasa.gov/d/65is-96k6) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites. These orbits are determined sub-daily (ultra-rapid generation), daily (rapid generation), and weekly (final IGS product). The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator retrieves these individual solutions and generates the official IGS combined orbit products. The orbits generated by the individual ACs and the combination products generated by the ACCs are available at the CDDIS. These orbits can be used to determine precise coordinates of the observing stations, gravity field parameters, and Earth orientation parameters. The IGS Final products are the basis for the IGS reference frame and are intended for those applications demanding high consistency and quality.* [Behavioral Monitoring and Evaluation for the Delivery of Interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (B-MEDIC), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bkdc-3xx8) - Crew behavioral health and performance are of high importance,
especially for long duration exploration missions. Early detection of
stress and effective options for restoration and enhancement of
behavioral health are imperative for accomplishment of mission
objectives and for maintaining a productive spaceflight environment. To
address the behavioral health issues during exploration missions, the
NASA Behavioral Health and Performance Program Element (BHP) is looking
for a non-invasive technology that would unobtrusively, and with minimal
crew time and effort: monitor physiological markers of stress; offer
countermeasures for maintenance and restoration of behavioral health;
and identify methods to prevent decrements in behavioral health. The
primary goal of this project is the development of a tool to provide
Behavioral Monitoring and Evaluation for the Delivery of Interactive
Cognitive behavioral therapy (B-MEDIC).  During Phase I we will provide
an analysis of measures and technologies for physiologically monitoring,
assessing and treating stress; and provide requirements for the
technological enhancements necessary to produce B-MEDIC. By the end of
Phase II, our multi-disciplinary team proposes to develop a functioning
prototype of B-MEDIC to address the following gaps outlined in the BHP
Integrated Research Plan (July 2010): BMED1, BMED2, and BMED6. (Phase I

Maneuver detection and reconstruction are processes by which an independent observer may determine when and how a body is moving in a dynamical system under the influence of unmodeled active control. This research shall specifically address the problem of how one can determine and reconstruct orbital maneuvers assuming they are performed optimally with respect to fuel expenditure. This assumption is valid due to limited availability of fuel for space-based missions and how important fuel is to a successful mission.

The inevitable goal of this research is produce an estimation algorithm that accounts for the influences of unmodeled optimal control. Essentially, this research is uniting the fields of estimation and optimal control in an algorithm that is applicable to various disciplines. Algorithm development will involve merging current research in maneuver detection with lessons from various fields of study including astrodynamics, estimation, optimal control, information fusion, and Space Situational Awareness. The work will primarily be simulation-based, and actual mission data would likely be used to help quantify the algorithms accuracy. Initial work will start by investigating linear estimator algorithms, but eventually the work will be pushed to higher order, non-Gaussian filters.

Understanding the dynamics of Earths orbital environment is of paramount concern. With the increase in orbital debris from recent collisions, and the increase in launch activity this environment is becoming increasingly crowded. Overcrowding in this environment increases the hazards associated with it due to increased potential for collisions. By gaining a better understanding of the dynamics (both natural and active) associated with this environment we can better pinpoint these potential hazards. Algorithms such as the one proposed in this paper help reduce the hazards associated with space-based missions, which is imperative to ensuring continued access to Earth-orbit and beyond.* [A 200 MHz Bandwidth, 4096 Spectral Channels, 3 W Power Consumption, Digital Auto-Correlation Spectrometer Chip for Spaceborne Microwave Radiometers, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/amgd-8rav) - NASA?s program for Exploration of the Solar System requires
high-resolution microwave spectrometers for the analysis of chemical
composition and  physical properties of solar system atmospheres. The
anticipated results of the proposed R/R&amp;D effort (Phase I and II),
if the project is successful, are to demonstrate experimentally the
first digital auto-correlation spectrometer on a single chip for
spaceborne microwave radiometers with the following important
characteristics: (a) a bandwidth of 200 MHz, (b) 4096 spectral channels
for high-resolution spectroscopy,  (c) less than 3 W power consumption,
(d) a mass of less that 800 grams, and (e) a space-qualifiable design
and fabrication technology.  The innovative approach proposed for
achieving these  significant objectives consists of a synergistic
combination of the following: (a) a unique parallel architecture that
will reduce the operating clock frequency,  relative to a single-stream
architecture, by a factor of 2 and consequently will lower significantly
the power consumption,  (b) novel differential analog and digital
circuits that will improve robustness while operating in the presence of
total dose natural radiation found in the space environment, and (c) an
advanced 0.13 um CMOS fabrication process  available from IBM for
manufacturing high-performance, low-power, reliable,  and robust (total
dose radiation and latch-up resistant) space-qualifiable chips.* [Effect of Ambipolar Potential on the Propulsive Performance of the GDM Plasma Thruster, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nb82-n629) - The Gasdynamic Mirror (GDM) thruster is an electric propulsion device, without electrodes, that will magnetically confine a plasma with such density and temperature as to make the ion-ion collision mean free path much shorter than its length, but the macroscopic time scale is smaller than the characteristic time for electron-ion equilibrium. So, the electrons and ions have different temperatures and the magnetic mirror field induces an ambipolar axial electrostatic field which, acting with the nozzle effect of the diverging magnetic field, will accelerate the ions exiting the GDM in a jet along the centerline, giving the thruster a specific impulse that is up to 30 times greater than a comparable device in which the hot propellant is expanded adiabaticallyThe density and temperature ranges and the basic mode of GDM operation mesh well with electric power input by microwaves via Electron-Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH). A combined ECRH/GDM thruster will have an operating envelope that will span the gap (about two orders of magnitude in density) between ion engines and magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) arc thrusters, without the endurance limitations imposed by electrodes. The proposed research will explore the operational envelope of these thrusters. Experiments have shown that stable operation can be achieved.* [High-Bandwidth Photon-Counting Detectors with Enhanced Near-Infrared Response, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/biu7-emmw) - Laser optical communications offer the potential to dramatically
increase the link bandwidth and decrease the emitter power in long-range
space communications. Newest system designs require photon-counting
arrays operated at high detection efficiency, tens of picoseconds
temporal resolution, and capability to handle high detection rates at
the wavelength of the laser beam. We propose to develop a novel
photon-counting detector array in near infrared, operated with moderate
cooling, high-detection efficiency, high saturation counting rate, and
capable of high timing resolution. In Phase I, we will investigate
methods to integrate photon absorption enhancement techniques into the
photon detector process flow and demonstrate the elements of the
technology yielding photon-counting detector arrays with high detection
efficiency at 1064 nm, high bandwidth and saturation-counting rate. In
Phase II, we will integrate the new process flow with readout
electronics into compact photon-counting arrays using hybrid and
monolithic integration technologies. Detector and readout circuit design
will be improved to meet the detection efficiency, noise, timing
resolution, and linearity requirements.* [Evaluating Prognostics Performance for Algorithms Incorporating Uncertainty Estimates](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3jfv-p8nq) - Uncertainty Representation and Management (URM) are an integral part of the prognostic system development.1As capabilities of prediction algorithms evolve, research in developing newer and more competent methods for URM is gaining momentum.2Beyond initial concepts, more sophisticated prediction distributions are obtained that are not limited to assumptions of Normality and unimodal characteristics. Most prediction algorithms yield non-parametric distributions that are then approximated as known ones for analytical simplicity, especially for performance assessment methods. Although applying the prognostic metrics introduced earlier with their simple definitions has proven useful, a lot of information about the distributions gets thrown away. In this paper, several techniques have been suggested for incorporating information available from Remaining Useful Life (RUL) distributions, while applying the prognostic performance metrics. These approaches offer a convenient and intuitive visualization of algorithm performance with respect to metrics like prediction horizon and α-λ performance, and also quantify the corresponding performance while incorporating the uncertainty information. A variety of options have been shortlisted that could be employed depending on whether the distributions can be approximated to some known form or cannot be parameterized. This paper presents a qualitative analysis on how and when these techniques should be used along with a quantitative comparison on a real application scenario. A particle filter based prognostic framework has been chosen as the candidate algorithm on which to evaluate the performance metrics due to its unique advantages in uncertainty management and flexibility in accommodating non-linear models and non-Gaussian noise. We investigate how performance estimates get affected by choosing different options of integrating the uncertainty estimates. This allows us to identify the advantages and limitations of these techniques and their applicability towards a standardized performance evaluation method.* [Airport Ground Resource Planning Tool, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/76zd-qsd5) - This effort undertakes the creation of an Airport Ground Resource Planning (AGRP) tool.  Little or no automation is currently available to support airport ground resource allocation decisions.  The AGRP tool provides visualization both of the resource assignments as well as other information relevant to making resource assignment decision.  In addition, AGRP automates or advises resource assignments, improving efficiency while reducing workload.  In Phase 2, we propose to continue development of the AGRP tool through four work areas.  First, we will complete the map and Resource Allocation displays.  We will also complete the algorithm to automate resource allocation decisions and integrate it with the displays.  The resulting AGRP prototype will be evaluated operationally.  We will also extend the Phase 1 work to develop a block out time predictor, which would have tremendous application and benefit in other traffic management systems.  In Phase 1, we proposed an architecture in which applications such as AGRP can subscribe to receive SMS data via a standardized interface.  In Phase 2 we will complete the specifications for and implementation of this interface, which will replace the existing SMS client-server communication.* [A Comprehensive Fatigue Management Program and an Evaluation of a Photic Countermeasure for Mission Controllers](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nzhg-s5xe) - FINAL REPORT SUMMARY (Submitted September 2015):    
The success of a human spaceflight critically depends on the interaction between the crewmembers and the flight controllers. The ability of the crew and the controllers to remain alert and maintain high levels of cognitive function while operating and/or monitoring complex, technical equipment, is essential. Optimal human health, performance, and safety during space flight operations requires sufficient sleep and synchrony between the circadian pacemaker—which regulates the timing of sleep, endocrine function, alertness, and performance—and the timing of the imposed sleep-wake schedule.    
Flight controllers work rotating shifts, including nightshifts. Such schedules instigate significant circadian misalignment and acute and chronic sleep deprivation and consequently fatigue. Although the effects are often unrecognized, both the acute and chronic lack of sleep substantially degrades an individual’s ability to react and think quickly, to make good decisions, and to recognize when fatigue is impairing his or her own performance and safety. Further, these elements of fatigue adversely affect personal health, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal and heart disease, impairing glucose metabolism and immune function, and substantially increasing the risk of injury due to motor vehicle crashes. In addition, it is likely that a substantial proportion of flight controllers suffer from undiagnosed sleep disorders which will further impair their sleep and exacerbate fatigue. The deleterious effects of fatigue are readily observed in a wide range of safety-sensitive professions and include increased risk of self-injury, higher rates of fatigue-related motor vehicle accidents, and greater incidence of serious errors.    
We implemented a Fatigue Risk Management Program (FRMP) for the flight controllers. The goals of this program were to reduce the adverse consequences of fatigue on the flight controllers’ alertness, performance, health, and safety. The objectives of the program were to: Evaluate the current flight controller schedules (Phase 1); Develop an online education training program (Phase 2); Offer an efficient online screening for common sleep disorders (Phase 3); and Evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and efficacy of a combined fatigue countermeasure including shorter-wavelength light exposure during operational night shifts (Phase 4).    
Historical flight controller schedules were reviewed with regards to factors that affect physiological measures of alertness and scheduling recommendations were made to Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) management. We established collaboration with NASA Spaceflight Resources Management (SFRM) to develop a 9-module Fatigue Education Program tailored to flight controllers working Orbit 1 overnight shifts. The modules were released one-per-week to the entire MOD. In the ninth week, information was provided on common sleep disorders and flight controllers had the option of completing a short screening questionnaire to identify those at high risk for those disorders. Flight controllers (N=19) showed a small but non-significant (p=0.06) increase on the knowledge assessment scores after viewing the 9-part series, as compared to pre-viewing scores.     
We enrolled 17 flight controllers and 3 flight directors (9F, 33.3 ± 8.0 years [mean ± SD],) selected from the seven International Space Station mission control consoles regularly staffed for Orbit 1 operations (Flight, OPS Planning, ADCO, SPARTAN, ETHOS, CRONUS, Ground Control). Data were collected during one off-console week and each controller was scheduled to work two blocks (4-7 days each) of Orbit 1 shifts during the study. We randomized each block to either the control or experimental condition.  During the experimental condition, controllers were encouraged to visit the Experimental Break Room (EBR) once before the shift, twice during the shift, as operations allowed, and following t* [Compact isotope analysis system for in-situ biosignature investigation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c63w-wx28) - We propose to develop a sensor for in-situ stable isotope analysis from a lander/rover on future planetary missions.  The system will enable the collection of valuable information applicable to biosignature investigations, i.e., the search for evidence of life within the solar system.  Current limitations to in-situ isotope measurements will be overcome by utilizing a hollow fiber optic based IR spectroscopy concept.  This concept enables high precision measurements within the ultra-small sample volume (<<1ml) of the hollow fiber and has proven to be three orders of magnitude more sensitive in terms of required sample size than current state of the art isotope sensors.  The proposed project will focus on transitioning the current lab-based technique to a small size, weight, and power (SWaP) device that can be operated unattended.  Significant strides will be made in this direction through the use of optimized hollow fiber technology developed at OKSI.  In Phase I, proposed concepts for improving the system performance, reducing the SWaP, and engineering a field-capable device will be proven and specific options down selected for full development in Phase II.  A complete prototype will be produced to measure Carbon (C) and Sulfur (S) isotope ratios from solid rock samples in Phase II.  The ability to generate simultaneous C and S isotope measurements from solid samples has great potential for assessing biosignatures relating to sulfate reducing organisms and organisms using simple C substrates (including methanogens, fermenters, and others).  The sensitivity afforded by the proposed system would open up this capability to smaller samples than ever before measured as well as provide a potential device for remote deployment.  This could be a significant development in the search for these biosignatures on other planets and near space objects as well as in the early Earth rock record.* [Development of Nonlinear Phased Array Systems for Non-Destructive Evaluation and Structural Health Monitoring of Aerospace Structures](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rdbx-cax5) - Acoustic imaging has played an essential role in ensuring that structures and vehicles are in sound condition both during their construction and their operation. Our lab has developed a new sound focusing system: a phased array (colloquially referred to as an "acoustic lens") based upon wave transmission through adjustable non-linear media. For my research, I will develop a prototype of this system and explore its potential for imaging.

The lens is built from parallel chains of metallic spheres. These chains support the transmission of compact single wave pulses, and by pre-compressing a chain we can modify the signal speed within it. If the chains are differentially compressed and coupled with a linear medium, it is possible to time the transmission of a pulse so that the response it generates in the linear medium coalesces to a small volume, generating a "sound bullet." This device offers a unique combination of advantages over current techniques for acoustic imaging as it is capable of dynamically changing its focal point, it is able to support the creation of a single transient pulse (simplifying the task of signal analysis and possibly allowing for a more accurate result), and it is capable of supporting a powerful signal.

To develop the lens for practical use, three major issues will be addressed in order to determine the boundaries of its performance. First, the limits of where the signal can be focused will be studied. Second, methods to improve transmission of the signal to the linear system will be explored. And third, the limitations of signal power and the degradation of performance due to plastic deformation of the spheres will be determined.

With these issues addressed, I will construct a prototype of the lens. Once the prototype has been built research will then shift towards applying the lens to imaging. I will first test the ability of the lens to image features within bulk media and then move on to applying the lens to imaging within plate arrangements (where the acoustic response is more complex). This work will culminate with the imaging of space-craft structures.

Investigation into both the basic science behind the lens and the imaging capability of the lens will require a combination of computational modeling and experimental work. The computational modeling will be primarily carried out using the finite element method, a powerful modeling technique capable of accurately measuring physical behavior over a wide range of scales. Experimental characterization of the formation of sound bullets will be carried out with the use of hydrophones (for bulk systems) and laser vibrometers and strain gages (for plate systems).

The development of the highly nonlinear phased array fits squarely within the stated goals of NSA's materials and structures research program. The most obvious application of the tool is for its use in structural assessment during manufacture and maintenance, as its ability to create single pulses and its power may allow for the detection of damage types currently below the resolution threshold of current practices. This is particularly pertinent as NASA moves towards greater use of light-weight composite structures for its air and space missions, as the damage modes of composites tend to be difficult to detect with current acoustic imaging technology. Further development of the lens may allow it to be used for monitoring physical condition within a mission, as the ease with which the focal point may be moved may allow a single device integrated within a craft to cover a reasonably large area for damage assessment. These potential improvements in acoustic imaging will play a vital role in NASA's space goals: helping reduce the cost of space access, enabling access to extreme space environments, and ensuring that any future colonies or way stations are best prepared for the rigors of space.* [Resonating Nitrous Oxide Thruster, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7vgf-4rn7) - AeroAstro proposes decomposing nitrous oxide (N2O) as an alternative propellant to existing spacecraft propellants.  Decomposing N2O can be used as either a high Isp, hot-gas monopropellant or as a low Isp, cold gas for ACS thrusters.  AeroAstro further proposes to use an innovative technique to achieve N2O decomposition: gasdynamic resonance.  Gasdynamic resonance will elevate the N2O to the activation temperatures required for exothermic decomposition, allowing monopropellant operation without the difficulties of a catalyst.  One of the challenges of long-duration space exploration systems is finding a propellant for microspacecraft that is safe, reliable, robust, and performs better than current propulsion systems.  N2O can replace both hot-gas propellants such as hydrazine and cold-gas ACS systems such as nitrogen or isobutane.  N2O is non-toxic, has a low freezing point (-91<SUP>o</SUP>C), and stores as a liquid.  N2O is also a byproduct of the catalysis of ammonia, a main effluent of waste-water recycling systems for long-duration manned space missions.  The anticipated results of this effort are data demonstrating the operating parameters of resonating N2O, and a dual-mode thruster design capable of both hot-gas and cold-gas operation.  Phase II activity will evolve the design of the dual-mode thruster and demonstrate operation over a range of conditions.* [Solving a prisoner's dilemma in distributed anomaly detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2yfz-gx72) - Anomaly detection has recently become an important problem in many industrial and financial applications. In several instances, the data to be analyzed for possible anomalies is located at multiple sites and cannot be merged due to practical constraints such as bandwidth limitations and proprietary concerns. At the same time, the size of data sets affects prediction quality in almost all data mining applications. In such circumstances, distributed data mining algorithms may be used to extract information from multiple data sites in order to make better predictions. In the absence of theoretical guarantees, however, the degree to which data decentralization affects the performance of these algorithms is not known, which reduces the data providing participants' incentive to cooperate.This creates a metaphorical 'prisoners' dilemma' in the context of data mining.

 

In this work, we propose a novel general framework for distributed anomaly detection with theoretical performance guarantees. Our algorithmic approach combines existing anomaly detection procedures with a novel method for computing global statistics using local sufficient statistics. We show that the performance of such a distributed approach is indistinguishable from that of a centralized instantiation of the same anomaly detection algorithm, a condition that we call zero information loss. We further report experimental results on synthetic as well as real-world data to demonstrate the viability of our approach.

 The remaining content of this presentation is presented in Fig. 1.* [Ghost Imaging of Space Objects](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nn45-n46n) - <p>Ghost imaging is an optical imaging technique that utilizes the correlations between optical fields in two channels. One of the channels contains the object, however lacks any spatial resolution. In the other, empty channel a space-resolving optical detection is allowed. The image is reconstructed by correlating the signals from two channels. In the original implementation, the channels had to be coupled to quantum-correlated (entangled) optical fields. Later it was shown that this approach could also work with ordinary thermal light (e.g., star light), which also possesses correlation properties. However the ghost imaging geometry remains poorly compatible with the imaging of astronomical objects. Specifically, creating the correlated optical channels requires a beam splitter to be placed between the source and the object. The study team recently re-examined this requirement and found a possibility to avoid it, therefore potentially opening the doors to the ghost-imaging of distant objects using natural light. The key to the proposed approach is the understanding that an optical mode can be coupled in two channels not only by splitting its amplitude with a beam splitter, but also by sub-mode detection, which occurs naturally when the object is smaller than the transverse coherence length. In Phase-I the team will discuss the requirements arising for this type of ghost imaging and theoretically validate the novel approach.</p>* [Combining Discrete Element Modeling, Finite Element Analysis, and Experimental Calibrations for Modeling of Granular Material Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qyby-si75) - The current state-of-the-art in DEM modeling has two major limitations
which must be overcome to ensure that the technique can be useful to
NASA engineers and the commercial sector: the computational intensive
nature of the software, and the lack of an established methodology to
determine the particle properties to best accurately model a given
physical system.   The proposed work will address both of these
limitations. We will look at two approaches to overcome the particle
count limitations of DEM: investigate the scaling up of particle size;
and combine FEA and DEM to look at problems of densely packed solids. We
will explore regimes where DEM and FEA are applicable and establish a
coupling methodology that can be further developed during phase II.  To
address the lack of an established methodology to determine the particle
properties to best accurately model a given physical system, we will
investigate several small scale experiments that can be used to
characterize DEM models. The proposed work will advance the
state-of-the-art in DEM.  At the end of phase I we will show the
feasibility of developing modeling approaches to overcome the main
limitations of DEM.* [Aircraft Anomaly Prognostics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/b2uc-z6ks) - Ridgetop Group will leverage its proven Electromechanical Actuator (EMA) prognostics methodology to develop an advanced model-based actuator prognostic reasoner (MAPR). Ridgetop's concept is a self-contained, embedded prognostic reasoner with a passive connection to common avionic data busses. By monitoring actuator health in real time and providing early warning of incipient fault conditions, the proposed MAPR would enable condition based maintenance (CBM) of critical avionic flight control systems and support safer, more reliable next generation air transportation. 
The novel approach will effectively decouple the passive prognostic reasoner from the target flight control system, or actuator, and will support multiple avionic data bus interfaces, such as MIL-STD-1553, easing adoption, validation, integration, and support. Potentially, a single MAPR could monitor multiple flight control systems, reducing overall sensor costs. Furthermore, an embedded MAPR implementation with field upgradeable firmware would support evolving interface standards and prognostic health measurement capabilities. Finally, the proposed MAPR architecture is ideally suited for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, which dramatically accelerates technology readiness and commercial introduction.* [Detection of Amino Acids/Organics on an Open-Tubular Ion/Liquid Chromatograph](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v8mt-pnnv) - <p>Science Goals and Objectives We propose to develop a open tubular (OT) ion/liquid chromatograph (I/LC) with pulsed amperometry and UV array detection for identification and chiral separation of amino acids. This is a follow-up to the already established capabilities of OTIC to characterize soluble inorganic and small organic ions (formate, acetate, benzoate etc.). The final deliverable will be a TRL4 instrument that can both help characterize the habitability of an environment by measuring inorganic and organic ions as well as searching for a specific biomarker, namely amino acids and specifically their chirality. By combining chiral measurements of amino acids with a broader survey of the inorganic and organic constituents, our compact instrument will provide multiple pieces of evidence about the possibility of past or present life on other planetary bodies. Methodology Separation of amino acids on multifunctional ion exchange media in macroscale columns with ionic eluents and pulsed amperometric detection is already an established commercial technique. Open tubular columns of same functionality have not been developed, but should not pose a major hurdle. Our present OT column fabrication process allows us to also readily make reverse phase columns, better suited for looking for nonionic organics. The first goal of this work will be to develop and demonstrate OT separations of amino acids. We will then extend the standard amino acid separation to chiral separations using a chiral stationary phase and/or a chiral eluent. A pulsed amperometric detector will be demonstrated for amino acid identification with high sensitivity. The availability of LEDs down to the deep UV and active pixel array imaging technology now enable sensitive capillary scale UV detection, this will be used for the detection of nonionic organics. Through previous ASTID funding (PI Dasgupta), we have made fundamental advances in fabricating polymethylmethacrylate OT capillary columns that can be dried, frozen and thawed repeatedly without any adverse effect on performance. We have also developed a portable OTIC instrument that works with pL-nL scale samples reproducibly, can accomplish a common 5 anion separation in less than 2 min, consumes &lt;1 W of power and weighs &lt; 2 kg in present form. This instrument will be the platform for integrating the novel OT columns for amino acid separation as well as the novel UV absorbance detector array. Relevance Understanding the habitability of other places in our solar system and searching for evidence of past or present life is a key goal of NASA&#39;s space Exploration Program. These goals are also directly identified in the &#39;Planetary habitats&#39; crosscutting theme of the 2013-22 planetary science decadal survey. This instrument will enable a deeper understanding of habitability and potentially life, and is well suited for incorporation in the proposed Discovery class Icebreaker mission. Icebreaker seeks to search for biomolecular signs of life below the surface at Martian poles as well as characterize past and present habitability of its landing site. This proposal will expand the capabilities of the current OTIC system to allow amino acid biomarker detection, taking this capability from TRL2 - TRL4, by incorporating novel columns and detectors into the existing OTIC portable instrument. The versatility of the instrument will make it well suited for other orbiter/lander missions, e.g., an Enceladus fly by orbiter for in-situ plume analysis.</p>* [Development and Testing an Energetic Charged Particle Prototype Instrument with a Novel Synthetic Diamond Cherenkov Radiator](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jvtr-mknx) - Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events accelerate ions and electrons over a wide range of energies in processes that are still not fully understood. The energy spectra of SEP events is one key aspect in studying particle acceleration and propagation.  Over limited energy ranges, SEP spectra are often approximated by a power law; over the full energy range, SEP events exhibit changing spectral shapes (e.g. “knees”, “roll-overs” and “cut-offs”).  Measurements of such features is often compromised by the need to combine measurements from more than one instrument, each with its own limited energy range.  Even if there are no gaps between the energy intervals of the instruments, differing systematics can severely impact the data.  A single instrument capable of measurements over a continuous and extended energy range would offer vastly more reliable measurement of the energy spectra of SEP events.  

For energies from ~1 MeV upward, solid-state detectors (SSDs) are the primary tool for measuring particle energies and composition for space-based instruments. Particles that stop in instruments are measured using the dE/dx versus residual energy technique, while penetrating particles are measured using the multiple (at least two) dE/dx technique. As the energy increases, the resolution of the later technique rapidly declines. For typical instruments, ~100 MeV for protons is the upper limit of the multiple dE/dx technique.  Additional SSDs can extend the range, though the resulting increased instrument length decreases geometrical factors and statistics for higher energies, and mass increases as well.  Because the SEP spectra often exceed ~100 MeV, other techniques are employed to extend the instrument energy range upward. Cherenkov detectors are a common technique for extending energy measurements for energetic particle telescopes. Examples of space-based instruments that have used Cherenkov detectors include the CRNC on IMP-8 and the KET on Ulysses.  The biggest limitation to the use of Cherenkov radiators in past designs has been the gap between the energy where the SSD measurements lose resolution and the minimum energy threshold of suitable Cherenkov radiators.  In conjunction with Applied Diamond, Inc., we propose to develop and test a Cherenkov detector based on large area (presently up to 5 cm diameter) layers of synthetic diamond.  Such a radiator would take advantage of diamond’s high index of refraction (n = 2.42) to attain an energy threshold (~95 MeV for protons), nearly ideal for use with Si detector stacks. A diamond Cherenkov detector would extend the energy reach of an instrument to >200 MeV. This would not only double the energy reach, but also attain the energy threshold of sapphire Cherenkov detectors (n = 1.76, proton threshold of ~200 MeV) which could be added  to achieve still higher energy measurements if required.  Similarly, a plastic Cherenkov detector (n = 1.5, threshold ~300 MeV) could further extend the energy measurements to ~450 MeV.  Thus a single instrument could provide measurements over a continuous energy interval from ~1-450 MeV for protons with no breaks in the measured energy spectra.* [Multi-channel Combining for for airborne flight research using Standard Protocols](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kt4b-3x4k) - Glenn Research Center (GRC) proposes a 2-year effort for the Core Topic Area: Operations Technologies. The technology specifically supports NASA's Earth Science airborne systems including Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) including autonomous operations and improvements in efficient operations of real-time communications for airborne science research.  

The airborne science research aircraft such as the Global Hawk, DC-8 and P-3 use custom channel combining of Iridium satellite phones to continuously monitor science payload and housekeeping data as well as science payload power control and reporting.  This technology is also used for aircraft control.   The current systems have known problems, which results in inefficient data delivery and poor reliability ' particularly when attempting to use standard Internet protocols to login and control.  The Internet community recently announced an experimental protocol, multipath-TCP. We propose to characterize the current Iridium modems and model those channels.  We will then evaluate multipath-TCP as a generic solution to the channel-combining problem when using TCP and to utilize those techniques inherent in multipath-TCP to develop standardized multipath-UDP.  Multipath-UDP would provide a standardized channel-combining technique when using applications that have UDP-based datagram delivery.

The Technology Readiness Level is currently 2 for all multipath-TCP using noisy and unreliable links.  The system will initially be tested in a laboratory environment but will quickly move to real modems and hardware to obtain a TRL of 6 (System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.) If we can develop a software only solution that will work with existing hardware we could obtain a TRL of 8 (flight qualified through test and demonstration) by the end of the project.* [Pattern-based GIS for understanding content of very large Earth Science datasets](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j6px-ravk) - The research focus in the field of remotely sensed imagery has shifted from collection and warehousing of data ' tasks for which a mature technology already exists, to auto-extraction of information and knowledge discovery from this valuable resource ' tasks for which technology is still under active development. In particular, intelligent algorithms for analysis of very large rasters, either high resolutions images or medium resolution global datasets, that are becoming more and more prevalent, are lacking. We propose to develop the Geospatial Pattern Analysis Toolbox (GeoPAT) a computationally efficient, scalable, and robust suite of algorithms that supports GIS processes such as segmentation, unsupervised/supervised classification of segments, query and retrieval, and change detection in giga-pixel and larger rasters. At the core of the technology that underpins GeoPAT is the novel concept of pattern-based image analysis. Unlike pixel-based or object-based (OBIA) image analysis, GeoPAT partitions an image into overlapping square scenes containing 1,000'100,000 pixels and performs further processing on those scenes using pattern signature and pattern similarity ' concepts first developed in the field of Content-Based Image Retrieval. This fusion of methods from two different areas of research results in orders of magnitude performance boost in application to very large images without sacrificing quality of the output.

GeoPAT v.1.0 already exists as the GRASS GIS add-on that has been developed and tested on medium resolution continental-scale datasets including the National Land Cover Dataset and the National Elevation Dataset. Proposed project will develop GeoPAT v.2.0 ' much improved and extended version of the present software. We estimate an overall entry TRL for GeoPAT v.1.0 to be 3-4 and the planned exit TRL for GeoPAT v.2.0 to be 5-6.  Moreover, several new important functionalities will be added. Proposed improvements includes conversion of GeoPAT from being the GRASS add-on to stand-alone software capable of being integrated with other systems, full implementation of web-based interface, writing new modules to extent it applicability to high resolution images/rasters and medium resolution climate data, extension to spatio-temporal domain, enabling hierarchical search and segmentation, development of improved pattern signature and their similarity measures, parallelization of the code, implementation of divide and conquer strategy to speed up selected modules. 

The proposed technology will contribute to a wide range of Earth Science investigations and missions through enabling extraction of information from diverse types of very large datasets.
Analyzing the entire dataset without the need of sub-dividing it due to software limitations offers important advantage of uniformity and consistency.  We propose to demonstrate the utilization of GeoPAT technology on two specific applications. The first application is a web-based, real time, visual search engine for local physiography utilizing query-by-example on the entire, global-extent SRTM 90 m resolution dataset. User selects region where process of interest is known to occur and the search engine identifies other areas around the world with similar physiographic character and thus potential for similar process. The second application is monitoring urban areas in their entirety at the high resolution including mapping of impervious surface and identifying settlements for improved disaggregation of census data.* [Cyanide Mediated Systems Chemistry Towards Proto-metabolic Pathways](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7xcd-d8mq) - Of all the plausible prebiotic source molecules, cyanide and aldehydes are considered the simplest and widely prevalent. The reactions of cyanide and simple aldehydes, in the context of prebiotic chemistry, are proposed to have played a major role in accumulating important prebiologically relevant building blocks (nucleobases, sugars, hydroxy acids, fatty acids and amino acids). However, further chemistries of the thus produced primordial building blocks are usually dealt “separately”, in isolation from the very prebiotic molecular source molecules they were produced from, which is highly unrealistic. Systems chemistry is an important concept that has to be reckoned with in prebiotic chemistry, especially given the heterogeneous product distribution that results in almost all of the prebiotic reactions (for example the formose reaction and HCN polymerization to name a few).

We hypothesize that under systems chemistry scenarios the source prebiotic molecules (such as cyanide and formaldehyde) would also interact with their respective reaction products, and lead to productive primordial reaction pathways. Specifically, we hypothesize that the transformations of simple aldehydes and alpha-hydroxy keto acids by their interaction with cyanide (in the presence and absence of amino compounds) would lead to alternative and extant biogenic molecules. We propose to systematically investigate the scope of this “cyanide mediated systems chemistry” with a view to developing an inventory of systems chemistry reactions (such as the reactions in a reductive citric acid cycle) that can become self-sustaining given a continuous supply of prebiotic source molecules. This would set the stage for systems chemistry to transform into proto-metabolic pathways.

We have promising preliminary results that lend credence to the “cyanide mediated systems chemistry” hypothesis and approach. We have discovered that cyanide interacts with many small molecules (such as formaldehyde and glyoxylate), gets incorporated and hydrolyzed to yield a suite of hydroxy acids that are constituents of some of the metabolic cycles of extant biology. Moreover, based on the potential to transform such hydroxy acids to keto acids, we propose that interaction of these keto acids with cyanide would open up opportunities (such as reductive chemistries) that were not possible previously in a prebiotic context. Based on this hypothesis, we have developed an efficient conversion of an alpha-keto acid (oxala acetate) to its corresponding alpha hydroxy acid (malate) under potentially prebiotic conditions. This observation also opens up a novel ‘reductive amination’ process that could convert selected alpha-keto acids to the corresponding alpha-amino acids. The demonstration of many of the key steps of the “reductive” citric acid cycle, that so far has eluded experimental demonstration, would become possible by employing this “cyanide mediated” chemical transformation repetitively. 

This proposal addresses the “prebiotic evolution” research emphasis of Exobiolgy, specifically relating to the major objective in determining what chemical systems could have served as precursors of metabolic systems on Earth and/or elsewhere. This proposal also experimentally models a type of early environment on the Earth in which organic chemical synthesis could occur in the context of protometabolic pathways.* [Extreme Energy Particle Astrophysics with ANITA-V - University of Kansas Center for Research, Inc. (Co-I)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/twrj-7xk4) - This is a Co-I proposal with the lead proposal being submitted by Professor Peter W. Gorham, Department of Physics and Astronomy,from the University of Hawaii at Monoa for the the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) mission. ANITA seeks to detect and elucidate the sources of the highest energy particles in the universe via measurements of cosmogenic ultra-high energy neutrinos. Such neutrinos are in many cases predicted to be the only unattenuated astrophysical messengers that arrive at Earth with precise directional information, since neutrinos are neutral particles with very weak interactions with matter in intergalactic space. Neutrinos that ANITA seeks to detect will signal the presence of the most extreme astrophysical accelerators and environments, and complement the information available via electromagnetic messengers from gamma-rays to radio waves. 

ANITA uses a long-duration balloon payload equipped with 48 dual-polarization horn antennas to detect radio impulses in the frequency range 200-1200 MHz, within which the properties of cold Antarctic ice include extreme radio-transparency and depths of up to 4 km. If a neutrino interacts anywhere within the ice sheet in ANITA's view from stratospheric altitudes, we can detect the emerging radio impulse and determine its direction and other characteristics with high precision. This in turn allows us to select candidate neutrinos from among the thermal and anthropogenic backgrounds with high confidence, and to derive angular information about the arrival direction of such candidates as well. 

Recently ANITA analysis investigated a new detection channel, which focuses on tau-lepton-generating neutrinos, which lead to a unique experimental signature for which ANITA has potentially very high sensitivity, and a candidate event has been detected in prior data. This new detection channel has added to the variety of methods by which ANITA continues to improve its sensitivity and reach into predicted models for cosmogenic neutrinos, for which ANITA has among the best constraints of any detector to date. 

ANITA is currently the only active NASA mission with the capability to measure ultra-high energy neutrinos, and ANITA's ultra-high energy neutrino sensitivity while on orbit is unmatched by any other instrument, ground- or space-based. As such it is a direct contributor to our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe, through astrophysical messengers that provide unique information about the most extreme and energetic objects in the cosmos.* [Development of a Reparametrized Semi-Empirical Force Field to Compute the Rovibrational Structure of Large PAHs](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k24u-t59e) - The Spitzer Space Telescope observation of spectra most likely attributable to diverse and abundant populations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in space has led to tremendous interest in these molecules as tracers of the physical conditions in different astrophysical regions. A major challenge in using PAHs as molecular tracers is the complexity of the spectral features in the 3-20 μm region. The large number and vibrational similarity of the putative PAHs responsible for these spectra necessitate determination for the most accurate basis spectra possible for comparison. It is essential that these spectra be established in order for the regions explored with the newest generation of observatories such as SOFIA and JWST to be understood.

Current strategies to develop these spectra for individual PAHs involve either matrix-isolation IR measurements or quantum chemical calculations of harmonic vibrational frequencies. These strategies have been employed to develop the successful PAH IR spectral database as a repository of basis functions used to fit astronomically observed spectra, but they are limited in important ways.

Both techniques provide an adequate description of the molecules in their electronic, vibrational, and rotational ground state, but these conditions do not represent energetically hot regions for PAHs near strong radiation fields of stars and are not direct representations of the gas phase. Some non-negligible matrix effects are known in condensed-phase studies, and the inclusion of anharmonicity in quantum chemical calculations is essential to generate physically-relevant results especially for hot bands. While scaling factors in either case can be useful, they are agnostic to the system studied and are not robustly predictive.

One strategy that has emerged to calculate the molecular vibrational structure uses vibrational perturbation theory along with a quartic force field (QFF) to account for higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface. QFFs can regularly predict the fundamental vibrational frequencies to within 5 cm-1 of experimentally measured values. This level of accuracy represents a reduction in discrepancies by an order of magnitude compared with harmonic frequencies calculated with density functional theory (DFT). The major limitation of the QFF strategy is that the level of electronic-structure theory required to develop a predictive force field is prohibitively time consuming for molecular systems larger than 5 atoms. Recent advances in QFF techniques utilizing informed DFT approaches have pushed the size of the systems studied up to 24 heavy atoms, but relevant PAHs can have up to hundreds of atoms.

We have developed alternative electronic-structure methods that maintain the accuracy of the coupled-cluster calculations extrapolated to the complete basis set limit with relativistic and core correlation corrections applied: the CcCR QFF. These alternative methods are based on simplifications of Hartree—Fock theory in which the computationally intensive two-electron integrals are approximated using empirical parameters. These methods reduce computational time to orders of magnitude less than the CcCR calculations.

We have derived a set of optimized empirical parameters to minimize the difference between the CcCR QFF energies for the geometries used to build the force field for two molecular ions of astrochemical significance. We have shown that it is possible to derive a set of empirical parameters that will produce RMS energy differences of less than 2 cm-1 for our test systems.

We are proposing to adopt this reparameterization strategy and some of the lessons learned from the informed DFT studies to create a semi-empirical method whose tremendous speed will allow us to study the rovibrational structure of large PAHs with up to 100s of carbon atoms.* [Extreme Energy Particle Astrophysics with ANITA-V](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xuzj-3cz4) - This is the lead proposal for the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) mission. ANITA seeks to detect and elucidate the sources of the highest energy particles in the universe via measurements of cosmogenic ultra-high energy neutrinos at energies above 1EeV (1EeV=10^18 eV). Such neutrinos are in many cases predicted to be the only unattenuated astrophysical messengers that arrive at Earth with precise directional information, since neutrinos are neutral particles with very weak interactions with matter in intergalactic space. Neutrinos that ANITA seeks to detect will signal the presence of the most extreme astrophysical accelerators and environments, and complement the information available via electromagnetic messengers from gamma-rays to radio waves.

Busek&rsquo;s BET-300-P thruster is under active development as a precision reaction control system (RCS) which will provide orders of magnitude improvements over state-of-the-art alternative attitude control systems (ACS) for CubeSats and small spacecraft. The low inertia of CubeSats combined with vibrational disturbances and resolution limitations of state-of-the-art ACS presently limit precision body-pointing and position control. Busek&rsquo;s electrospray thrusters aboard the ESA LISA Pathfinder (NASA ST-7) spacecraft, recently demonstrated control of a proof mass location to within ~2nm per root Hz over a wide band. The BET-300-P, enhanced by exploitation of its high-speed dynamic response in this program, seeks to extend that success to small spacecraft platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Passively fed electrospray thrusters are highly compact, including fully integrated propellant supplies, and are capable of ~100nN thrust precision with 10&rsquo;s of nN noise. Thrust can be accurately throttled over &gt;30x, up to a scalable maximum of 10&rsquo;s to 100&rsquo;s of uN.&nbsp; While typically operated in largely continuous states they are unique in that emission can be electrically stopped/started at ms time scales. Thus, extremely low impulse bits may be achieved over very short durations, permitting throttling from &lt;0.1uNs up to 100&rsquo;s of uNs. Realization of this fundamental capability of the technology is presently limited by control circuitry. The proposed work seeks to study and overcome these limitations with a new control methodology.</p>

<p>These traits, combined with &gt;800s specific impulse, and thereby low propellant mass could enable these systems to replace traditional reaction wheel ACS and high-propellant mass cold gas systems; enabling milliarcsec control authority for CubeSats versus the present arcsec level SOA.</p>* [High Efficiency 4 K Cryocooler for Space Missions, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jhr9-pfbg) - <p>Future astrophysics missions require efficient, low-temperature cryocoolers to cool advanced instruments or serve as the upper stage cooler for sub-Kelvin refrigerators. Potential astrophysics missions include Lynx, the Origin Space Telescope, and the Superconducting Gravity Gradiometer. Cooling loads for these missions are up to 300 mW at temperatures of 4 to 10 K, with additional loads at higher temperatures for other subsystems. Due to low jitter requirements, a cryocooler with very low vibration is needed for many missions. In addition, a multi-stage cooler, capable of providing refrigeration at more than one temperature simultaneously, can provide the greatest system efficiency with the lowest mass. Turbo-Brayton cryocoolers have space heritage and are ideal for these missions due to negligible vibration emittance and high efficiency at low temperatures. The primary limitation in implementing Brayton cryocoolers at temperatures below 10&nbsp;K has been the development of high efficiency turbines. On the proposed program, Creare plans to leverage recent developments in gas bearing technology and low-temperature alternators to realize a high-efficiency, low-temperature turbine. On the Phase&nbsp;I project, we will perform a proof-of-concept demonstration of the turbine technology at temperatures down to 4&nbsp;K. On the Phase&nbsp;II project, we will build and demonstrate an advanced low-temperature turbine at temperatures of 4 to 10&nbsp;K.</p>* [PISCES: An Integral Field Spectrograph to Advance High Contrast Imaging Technologies](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dadp-fp9s) - This is a proposal to build a novel optical integral field spectrograph (IFS) called the Prototype Imaging Spectrograph for Coronagraphic Exoplanet Studies (PISCES) for use with the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program's High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) facility at JPL.  Integral field spectroscopy is ideal for high contrast imaging, because in addition to spectral characterization of exoplanet atmospheres, the data products sample chromatic speckles created by imperfections in the telescope and starlight suppression system.  It is of paramount importance to correct for these imperfections using focal plane wavefront sensing techniques.  However, no IFS has met the challenging performance requirements of a direct imaging of Earth-like exoplanets mission.  PISCES will demonstrate the ability for IFSs to operate in the high contrast imaging (contrast ~10^-9) regime, and the instrument concept proposed here represents a viable design for a flight-like instrument targeting exoplanet spectroscopy with direct imaging.  This research program would raise the TRL of this high contrast IFS from 3 to 5.

During the Roman Technology Fellowship Concept Study, we explored the PISCES design details and carried out trade studies.  We defined the instrument requirements, developed a baseline design for PISCES, simulated its performance, created an innovative high contrast lenslet design to mitigate spectral crosstalk, experimentally verified our simulator, prepared the vacuum compatible opto-mechanical design, and estimated the cost of this instrument.  We propose to build this PISCES design in the Development Effort in order to further advance the technological readiness of this instrument type.  PISCES would be assembled and tested at Goddard, and subsequently delivered and integrated into the HCIT facility.  The HCIT will be used to verify the PISCES instrument performance, which will validate the PISCES model, and thereby advance the TRL of this system.  After demonstrating the performance, PISCES will be used to advance other critical high contrast technologies inside the HCIT.

Current laboratory testing of internal coronagraphs use adaptive optics to compensate for aberrations introduced by the optical assembly.  While deep contrasts (planet to star contrasts of ~10^-9) have been achieved in very narrow bandpasses (~1%), experimental tests at broader bandpasses have been unable to reach similar contrasts.  Expanding high contrast over a broad bandpass is a core objective of the Exoplanet Exploration Program's Technology Plan.  PISCES will be used as a facility class instrument to characterize the chromaticity of coronagraphs and their achieved wavefront solutions, towards the goal of isolating and rectifying the sources of bandwidth limitations.  The instrument and calibration procedures will be made available to other HCIT users, stimulating the development and assessment of all internal coronagraph types being studied in NASA's New Worlds Technology Program.

In addition to their unique value for imaging in high contrast scenes, IFSs have broad utility for characterizing emission line regions in a variety of astrophysical settings (e.g., AGN dynamical masses, globular clusters, supernovae, extragalactic star clusters, gamma ray bursts, and galaxies at various epochs).  The development of PISCES is directly relevant to the WFIRST AFTA mission, which has baselined IFSs for both dark energy and coronagraphic science.  By supporting the development of PISCES, the Roman Fellowship Program will 1) advance the technical readiness of a key instrument envisioned for both WFIRST and a future New Worlds imaging mission and 2) provide me with valuable experience towards my career goal of leading a flight instrument for a major space observatory.* [Advanced Source Deconvolution Methods for Compton Telescopes](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dhtj-2sup) - The next generation of space telescopes utilizing Compton scattering for astrophysical observations is destined to one day unravel the mysteries behind Galactic nucleosynthesis, to determine the origin of the positron annihilation excess near the Galactic center, and to uncover the hidden emission mechanisms behind gamma-ray bursts. Besides astrophysics, Compton telescopes are establishing themselves in heliophysics, planetary sciences, medical imaging, accelerator physics, and environmental monitoring.

Since the COMPTEL days, great advances in the achievable energy and position resolution were possible, creating an extremely vast, but also extremely sparsely sampled data space. Unfortunately, the optimum way to analyze the data from the next generation of Compton telescopes has not yet been found, which can retrieve all source parameters (location, spectrum, polarization, flux) and achieves the best possible resolution and sensitivity at the same time. This is especially important for all sciences objectives looking at the inner Galaxy: the large amount of expected sources, the high background (internal and Galactic diffuse emission), and the limited angular resolution, make it the most taxing case for data analysis. In general, two key challenges exist: First, what are the best data space representations to answer the specific science questions? Second, what is the best way to deconvolve the data to fully retrieve the source parameters?

For modern Compton telescopes, the existing data space representations can either correctly reconstruct the absolute flux (binned mode) or achieve the best possible resolution (list-mode), both together were not possible up to now. Here we propose to develop a two-stage hybrid reconstruction method which combines the best aspects of both. Using a proof-of-concept implementation we can for the first time show that it is possible to alternate during each deconvolution step between a binned-mode approach to get the flux right and a list-mode approach to get the best angular resolution, to get achieve both at the same time!

The second open question concerns the best deconvolution algorithm. For example, several algorithms have been investigated for the famous COMPTEL 26Al map which resulted in significantly different images. There is no clear answer as to which approach provides the most accurate result, largely due to the fact that detailed simulations to test and verify the approaches and their limitations were not possible at that time. This has changed, and therefore we propose to evaluate several deconvolution algorithms (e.g. Richardson-Lucy, Maximum-Entropy, MREM, and stochastic origin ensembles) with simulations of typical observations to find the best algorithm for each application and for each stage of the hybrid reconstruction approach.

We will adapt, implement, and fully evaluate the hybrid source reconstruction approach as well as the various deconvolution algorithms with simulations of synthetic benchmarks and simulations of key science objectives such as diffuse nuclear line science and continuum science of point sources, as well as with calibrations/observations of the COSI balloon telescope.

This proposal for “development of new data analysis methods for future satellite missions” will significantly improve the source deconvolution techniques for modern Compton telescopes and will allow unlocking the full potential of envisioned satellite missions using Compton-scatter technology in astrophysics, heliophysics and planetary sciences, and ultimately help them to “discover how the universe works” and to better “understand the sun”. Ultimately it will also benefit ground based applications such as nuclear medicine and environmental monitoring as all developed algorithms will be made publicly available within the open-source Compton telescope analysis framework MEGAlib.* [PAH Infrared Spectroscopy in the JWST Era](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pist-2gz5) - The extraordinary infrared instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will transform the field of cosmic spectroscopy. We propose to supply the astronomical community with theoretical and experimental spectra of a wide range of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and PAH clusters and to use our IR absorption spectra to calculate emission spectra that will be crucial in interpreting the new observational data.

The Infrared Space Observatory and Spitzer Space Telescopes have shown that the mid-IR emission spectrum of the interstellar medium is dominated by strong bands at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 12.7 microns superimposed upon broad underlying plateaus generally attributed to PAHs, PAH clusters and very small grains. Despite the limited spectral and spatial resolution of these data, detailed analysis has revealed that each band is, in fact, a blend of multiple emission features. Subtle variations in the band blending can be detected even for spectra measured at different positions within a single astronomical source. These variations can be seen to arise from multiple PAH and PAH-related carriers that are each responding differently to the local physical conditions. The James Webb Space Telescope has near-IR and mid-IR instruments, NIRSpec and MIRI, with an extremely high spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and sensitivity that will revolutionize infrared astronomy. These instruments will provide spatial maps on a sub-arcsecond scale with an unprecedented level of spectral detail, allowing detailed study of the interrelationship of the individual components within each emission band. This will provide a critical insight into the molecular characteristics of the emitting species and their (photo)chemical evolution in space.

Exploitation of these astronomical spectra requires fundamental data on potential emitting species that fully account for all astrophysically relevant materials. Over the last two decades, spectra of neutral and charged PAHs have been calculated using quantum theory. Due to computational limitations, this data set is biased towards smaller or highly symmetric species. In addition, continued analysis of the mid-IR emission bands by several recent Spitzer studies, has demonstrated that PAHs and PAH clusters with less symmetric structures containing “bay regions” are more important for understanding the IR emission bands than had previously been realized. The currently available infrared data set on less symmetric PAHs and PAH clusters is insufficient to exploit the astronomical data.

Advances in computing power now allow spectra for a much wider range of species to be calculated. In support of the analysis of Spitzer data and the upcoming JWST mission, we therefore propose to calculate the 3-20 micron spectra of isolated as well as clustered neutral and charged PAHs containing up to 150 carbon atoms and with a wide range of compact structures and eroded structures with irregular shapes containing “bay regions”, “coves”, and “fjords”. These theoretical data will be validated by a dedicated laboratory study of PAH species and their clusters. These IR absorption spectra will be used to calculate emission spectra that can be directly compared to existing astronomical observations and that will be used to guide our quantum chemical and experimental studies on relevant species for support of Early Release Science proposals for JWST.* [Non-deforming, high-reflectance X-ray coatings for Lynx and other future missions](https://data.nasa.gov/d/avkw-vguc) - The overarching challenge addressed by this proposal is the development of high-reflectance, high-resolution X-ray mirrors, to be used for the construction of lightweight X-ray telescopes for future NASA astronomy missions such as Lynx and others. The proposal's two specific aims are: 1) the development of optimized iridium-based interference coatings for the 0.1–10 keV band; and 2) the development of methods to mitigate coating-stress-induced substrate deformations in thin-shell glass and Si mirror segments. These goals will be achieved by building on established film deposition techniques and metrology infrastructure for X-ray optics that have been developed and advanced by the PI through APRA funding since 1999.

Specific Aim #1: Interference Coatings for the 0.1–10 keV Energy Band

Telescope effective area can be maximized by using Ir-based reflective coatings that exploit optical interference to provide higher reflectance than Ir alone. However, only preliminary investigations of such coatings have been conducted thus far; more research is required to fully optimize these coatings for maximum performance, to experimentally determine the coating designs that are feasible, and to determine the achievable X-ray reflectance, film stress, surface roughness, and thermal and temporal stability. The first specific aim of this proposal is to reach these very goals through a comprehensive research program. Demonstration of the achievable reflectance, stress, and roughness in stable, optimized coatings will in turn facilitate global telescope design optimization, by identifying the best coating for each mirror shell based on incidence angle, and on telescope effective-area and field-of-view requirements. The research has the potential to greatly increase the effective area of future X-ray telescopes.

Specific Aim #2: Mitigation of Coating-Stress-Induced Substrate Deformations

High-quality films of Ir and other candidate materials (e.g., B4C) to be investigated for the 0.1–10 keV band deposited by magnetron sputtering have high density and low roughness, and thus good X-ray performance. However Ir, B4C, and certain other materials have exceedingly high film stress when deposited under conditions for maximum reflectance. Residual film stress in the X-ray reflective coatings can deform thin-shell mirror segments, leading to unacceptable degradation of angular resolution. Coating stress was not an issue for Chandra. But for Lynx, for example, the substrates will be ~50x thinner, and so sub-arc-second resolution simply cannot be achieved using thin-shell mirror segments without the development of non-deforming coatings.

The second specific aim of this proposal is to develop techniques to mitigate coating-stress-induced deformations in glass and Si shell segments. Two potential solutions will be investigated: a) New deposition methods to control coating thickness uniformity and net film stress in two dimensions will be used to determine if already-developed zero-net-stress Ir-based coatings, as well as the new reflective coatings to be developed, can be deposited onto shell segments without inducing unacceptable substrate deformations, a question that has not yet been definitively addressed; if uniform coatings having sufficiently low deformation cannot be realized, then non-uniform coatings will be investigated, where spatial control of net film stress in 2D will compensate for potential non-uniform deformations. If successful, the effectiveness of the approach with more complex interference coatings will also be established. b) A more general (albeit more complex) method of mitigating stress-induced deformations will be investigated, specifically the use of balanced front- and back-side coatings, a technique that, if successful, can be used, in principle, with any type of coating (Ir-based, high-energy multilayers, etc.), regardless of its stress state. (The approach is likely incompatible with active correction, however.)* [Flash Drive Integrated Label Free Silicon Nano-Photonic Bio-Assays for Space Station Bio-Diagnostics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/drk7-qqpd) - <p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Here, Omega Optics Inc. (OO), in collaboration with University of Texas (UT), Austin and Texas A&amp;M University will develop a novel label-free photonic crystal (PC) micro-cavities based on-chip integrated electrically injected tunable transverse-coupled-cavity (TCC) vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) for high throughput diagnostic assays in early cancer detections. The device will enable low cost of ownership (COO) $50-$100 for consumable parts and measurement system is expected to be less than $1000. High sensitivities of less than 67 femto grams per millimeter is expected. It is noted that each PC cavity is immobilized with a unique capture biomolecule, and interrogated simultaneously for binding between the probe capture and target biomolecule. Binding is manifested by change in resonance wavelength due to the change in refractive index. Large effective modal volume and high quality factor of the resonance enables the optical mode to interact with more biomolecules for a longer interaction time thereby leading to high sensitivity compact sensors. Binding specificity is achieved by sandwich assay techniques combined with multiplexed detection for statistical confidence. Electrical injection enables chip integration of the light source that offers superior advantage over all existing optical sensors which rely on coupling of external optical sources with complex instrumentation. The device can be easily extended to any multi-analyte sensing for implementation in biomarker discovery, drug discovery, health diagnostics and in the long term, in screening. Market for cancer profiling technologies market is to be $54.8 billion in 2018, while the pharmaceuticals market is expected to grow to $1 Trillion. We expect to occupy a significant position in the above markets. Our technology is extremely versatile and the ramifications are far-reaching.</p>* [Digital System e-Prognostics for Critical Aircraft Computer Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yci3-3u4q) - Impact Technologies, in cooperation with Raytheon, proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative prognostics approach for aircraft digital electronics. The proposed non-invasive prognostic approach consists of advanced software and a minimal sensing, focused on incipient fault detection, isolating failure modes and predicting remaining useful life using improved prognostic models. The innovations will include development and validation of physics of failure models, applicable to a broad range of CMOS digital systems; associated damage accumulation models; and a signal processing and feature extraction approach for detecting and isolating VLSI failure modes.  In this approach, cradle-to-grave health state awareness is achieved through the use of model-based assessments in the absence of fault indications, and by updating these model-based assessments with sensed information. The PowerPC MPC7447 microprocessor will be used for validation testing during this program based on its use in such systems as the F-35 fighter Integrated Core Processor (ICP) and the fact that it is representative of the wide spread CMOS technology found in modern digital devices.  Finally, a commercialization path beginning with testing of the technologies within Raytheon's Labs will be presented along with the team's vision of how e-Prognostic technologies can be transitioned into safety critical commercial and military digital.* [Airborne Electro-Mechanical Actuator Test Stand for Development of Prognostic Health Management Systems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n83d-nj8a) - With the advent of the next generation of aerospace systems equipped with fly-by-wire controls, electro- mechanical actuators (EMA) are quickly becoming components critical to safety of aerospace vehicles. Being relatively new to the field, however, EMA lack the knowledge base compared to what is accumulated for the more traditional actuator types, especially when it comes to fault detection and prognosis. Scarcity of health monitoring data from fielded systems and prohibitive costs of carrying out real flight tests create the need to build high-fidelity system models and design affordable yet realistic experimental setups. The objective of this work is to build an EMA test stand that, unlike current laboratory stands typically weighing in excess of one metric ton, is portable enough to be easily placed aboard a wide variety of aircraft. This stand, named the FLEA (for Flyable Electro- mechanical Actuator test stand), allows testing EMA fault detection and prognosis technologies in flight environment, thus substantially increasing their technology readiness level – all without the expense of dedicated flights, as the stand is designed to function as a non-intrusive secondary payload. No aircraft modifications are required and data can be collected during any available flight opportunity: pilot currency flights, ferry flights, or flights dedicated to other experiments. The stand is currently equipped with a prototype version of NASA Ames developed prognostic health management system with models aimed at detecting and tracking several fault types. At this point the team has completed test flights of the stand on US Air Force C-17 aircraft and US Army UH-60 helicopters and more experiments, both laboratory and airborne, are planned for the coming months.* [Space Exposure for Structural-Health Aware Materials Experiment (SESAME), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/usd3-3789) - <p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">NASA has outlined a bold vision for future exploration on the Moon and Mars. Structural health monitoring (SHM) provides numerous benefits to these future missions, including increased reliability, reduced maintenance cost, and increased mission safety. Structural health monitoring (SHM) provides numerous benefits to future NASA missions, including increased reliability, reduced maintenance cost, and increased mission safety. Made In Space (MIS) has developed a suite of Structural-Health Aware Fault-Tolerant Engineered to Respond (SAFER) materials through an active Phase I STTR project to provide SHM capabilities. MIS has successfully demonstrated the SAFER materials through lab testing. The next step in the development of these materials is a demo in space, including exposure to the LEO environment as well as exposure to stimuli representing loading cases. MISSE-FF provides a platform for in-space characterization of the SAFER materials. MIS has developed an innovative Space Exposure for Structural-Health Aware Materials Experiment (SESAME) to expose the SAFER materials to the combined effects of the LEO environment and cyclic loading. SESAME is an active experiment intended to integrate with the sample deck of the standard MISSE Sample Carrier. SESAME is an innovative MISSE-FF payload for exposing and testing candidate materials for structural health monitoring on future space exploration missions. SESAME uses standard MISSE-FF power and data interfaces to simplify integration of the active experiment into existing ISS infrastructure. Space exposure is critical for further development of candidate structural health monitoring materials that will be used in future missions. The materials being proposed for SESAME testing have unique material properties that may be affected by space exposure. Fully characterizing the effect of space exposure will help manufacturers and designers better use these smart materials for greater impact on future space flight missions.</p>* [Adaptable Portable Gravity Offloading System for Deployable Solar Array Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/au8h-cyb9) - <p>Large, lightweight, deployable solar array structures have been identified as a key enabling technology for NASA, with analysis and design of these structures being the top challenge in meeting the overall goals of the NASA Space Technology Roadmap. Deployment ground testing and qualification of these and other deployable structures is a uniquely difficult task, as the intent is to validate microgravity performance and integrity within a 1 g testing environment. Existing gravity offloading test support equipment used for this purpose have&nbsp;several limitations: passive systems dynamically couple the test article to the offloader, active systems are currently limited to single-point offloading, and offloaders are typically immobile and designed for a single application. The proposed SBIR project seeks to improve existing gravity offloader equipment through the development of a portable and adaptable system that can be used for offloading <em>any</em> deployable structure while also improving accuracy through active control. Phase I of this SBIR project will demonstrate feasibility of this system through the development and testing of a prototype offloader unit. In Phase II, a full multipoint offloader system will be developed and demonstrated on a relevant deployable solar array structure.</p>* [MOPITT Gridded Monthly CO Retrievals (Thermal Infrared Radiances) V006](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fhsx-vure) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals.

The proposed device <u>INSPECT </u>can separate a range of biologically relevant molecules such as cells, large proteins, polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons and amino acids important for life detection. This technology will reduce interferents and concentrate samples thus lowering detection limits by providing more refined (or pre-separated) samples to on-board analytical instruments. Separation and concentration is achieved with micro-chromatography columns that borrow technology from solid phase extraction (SPE), solid phase micro-extraction (SPME), cell adhesion technology and traditional chromatography. The INSPECT system not only increases the resolution and sensitivity for life-detection but also uses low power, volume and mass, all of which are principal factors noted in subtopic S1.07 In Situ Instruments/Technologies for Planetary Science. This method is an improvement over other extraction systems that require volatile organic solvents or high volumes of solvent for sample processing.

They are believed to be the primary cause of major geomagnetic storms. Predicting in advance whether observed CMEs hit the Earth and carry geo-effective magnetic fields is a long-term priority for the CCMC located at NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center and other groups within NASA as well. Such predictions are very challenging, and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are considered as the most promising tool for achieving them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our proposed interactive and highly automated MHD modeling framework, CORHEL-AMCG, will allow users to routinely model multiple observed CMEs in a realistic coronal and solar-wind environment. CORHEL-AMCG will be significantly more accurate than existing routine models, by accounting for the complexity of pre-CME configurations, the slow initiation of CMEs, and their interaction in interplanetary space. These advances will make CORHEL-AMCG extremely useful for the broader scientific community and constitute a major step towards &nbsp;operational space-weather forecasting. A prototype of CORHEL-AMCG (for modeling single CMEs in a simplified coronal environment) will be available upon completion of Phase I and will be delivered to the CCMC for testing.</p>

We propose a design with a minimum of 1500 spatial samples with 200 spectral bands over the 400 nm to 2400 nm range. The imaging spectrometer volume is approximately 7.6 cm x 7 cm x 5.4 cm prior to packaging. The design is highly performing in both aberration control and in signal-to-noise performance. The purpose of this proposal is to develop a breadboard spectrometer that utilizes a catadioptric lens and a dual-faceted immersion grating. The later is a significant simplification when compared to the current standard forms, such as the Dyson or Offner forms, that require powered gratings. The breadboard will demonstrate the design and enable a quantitative assessment of the performance and of stray light contamination. This last is critical if an imaging spectrometer is to meet the stringent scientific requirements necessary for the climate change mission. The small size will also facilitate the temperature control of the spectral imager for long-term calibration stability.

ANITA seeks to detect and elucidate the sources of the highest energy particles in the universe via measurements of cosmogenic ultra-high energy neutrinos. Such neutrinos are in many cases predicted to be the only unattenuated astrophysical messengers that arrive at Earth with precise directional information, since neutrinos are neutral particles with very weak interactions with matter in intergalactic space. Neutrinos that ANITA seeks to detect will signal the presence of the most extreme astrophysical accelerators and environments, and complement the information available via electromagnetic messengers from gamma-rays to radio waves. 

ANITA uses a long-duration balloon payload equipped with 48 dual-polarization horn antennas to detect radio impulses in the frequency range 200-1200 MHz, within which the properties of cold Antarctic ice include extreme radio-transparency and depths of up to 4 km. If a neutrino interacts anywhere within the ice sheet in ANITA's view from stratospheric altitudes, we can detect the emerging radio impulse and determine its direction and other characteristics with high precision. This in turn allows us to select candidate neutrinos from among the thermal and anthropogenic backgrounds with high confidence, and to derive angular information about the arrival direction of such candidates as well. 

Recently ANITA analysis investigated a new detection channel, which focuses on tau-lepton-generating neutrinos, which lead to a unique experimental signature for which ANITA has potentially very high sensitivity, and a candidate event has been detected in prior data. This new detection channel has added to the variety of methods by which ANITA continues to improve its sensitivity and reach into predicted models for cosmogenic neutrinos, for which ANITA has among the best constraints of any detector to date. 

ANITA is currently the only active NASA mission with the capability to measure ultra-high energy neutrinos, and ANITA's ultra-high energy neutrino sensitivity while on orbit is unmatched by any other instrument, ground- or space-based. As such it is a direct contributor to our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe, through astrophysical messengers that provide unique information about the most extreme and energetic objects in the cosmos.* [Super Lyot ExoEarth Coronagraph (SLEEC)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5dxz-yypr) - This is a SAT/TDEM (Strategic Astrophysics Technology / Technology Development for Exoplanet Missions) proposal to provide enabling technologies for the HabEx (Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission) and LUVOIR (Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor) strategic mission concepts.

The HabEx and LUVOIR objectives include direct imaging and spectroscopic characterization of Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. These objectives pose substantial technological challenges well beyond currently demonstrated capabilities. For instance, the ongoing HabEx and LUVOIR concept studies have already shown that a robust ExoEarth science program requires instrumentation surpassing WFIRST/CGI’s (Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope / Coronagraph Instrument) pioneering benchmarks. Better contrast, significantly higher core throughput, improved tolerance of telescope pointing jitter and thermal drifts, minimal manufacturing and operational complexity, and larger high-contrast fields of view are among the critical factors. We rise to the challenge by offering innovations in design approach utilizing wavefront amplitude and phase manipulation in all available planes, leading to “super Lyot” coronagraphs. We leverage a body of record-holding accomplishments and extensive experience in contrast performance to ensure success. We propose to extend our previous ASMCS (Astrophysics Strategic Mission Concept Studies), TDEM, and WFIRST coronagraph studies in the areas of optimal design, mask fabrication, and laboratory demonstrations.
 
We adopt an end-to-end systems approach for the proposed work. This approach incorporates our best understanding of space telescope performance opportunities and limitations; an optimal coronagraph design with masks and stops at strategic locations in the instrument optical path; and precision wavefront control with state-of-the art deformable mirrors (DMs).
 
Previous work has established that all necessary components of the proposed technology have achieved at least Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4. In particular, achievement of WFIRST milestones thus far have demonstrated successful modeling, manufacture, and performance validation of the fundamental Lyot mask, shaped pupil, and wavefront control technologies to TRL 5. Thus, relevant system breadboards have been built and operated to demonstrate basic functionality and critical test environments, and associated performance predictions have been defined relative to final operating environment, placing our entry firmly at TRL 4. Advancement to TRL 5 requires system-level demonstration of the performance objectives in a simulated operational environment. The metrics target performance required for enabling HabEx and LUVOIR’s scientific goals, which are roughly an order of magnitude beyond the requirements and expectations for WFIRST/CGI contrast and wavefront error tolerances.
  
Advancing the Lyot-based coronagraph—the leader in validated coronagraphic performance—to a TRL 5 option for ExoEarth imaging and spectroscopy is important for formulating credible HabEx and LUVOIR project concepts. Now is the time to commence this work, as the mission studies are underway in preparation for the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. This proposing team is uniquely qualified for the task, as evidenced by our track record in performance demonstrations.* [Search for cosmic ultra-high energy neutrinos with ANITA-IV](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pux7-mgvb) - The ANITA long-duration balloon payload is designed to search for radio pulses associated with interactions of cosmic ultra-high energy neutrinos in the Antarctic ice sheets. Neutrinos are the only other stable fundamental particles, along with photons, whose directions be traced directly back to their sources without significant deflection or energy loss. By successfully determining the trajectories of observed impulsive radio signals from the ice, ANITA offers the possibility of neutrino astronomy at the highest possible energies. This includes sources such as ultra-high energy cosmic rays which outside the 50-100 MPc range of the local epoch are otherwise expected to be opaque to conventional photometric methods.

Currently, the United States Air Force (USAF) is pursuing a technology based on Hydroxyl Ammonium Nitrate (HAN, otherwise known as AF-M315E) with industry partners Aerojet and Moog.&nbsp; Based on the advantages offered by these propellants, MSFC should explore powering APU&rsquo;s with these propellants.</p><p>Due to the availability of space hardware, the principal investigator has found a collection of USAF hardware, that will act as a surrogate, which operates on a Hydrazine derivative.&nbsp; The F-16 fighter jet uses H-70 or 30% diluted Hydrazine for an Emergency Power Unit (EPU) which supplies power to the plane.&nbsp; The PI has acquired two EPU&rsquo;s from planes slated for destruction at the Davis Monthan AFB.</p><p>This CIF will include a partnership with 2 other NASA Centers who are individually seeking seed funds from their respective organizations: Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC).&nbsp; KSC is preparing for future flights from their launch pads that will utilize green propellants and desire a low-cost testbed in which to test and calibrate new leak detection sensors.&nbsp; DFRC has access to F-16&rsquo;s which can be used by MSFC &amp; KSC to perform a ground test that demonstrates emergency power supplied to the jet.</p><p>Neither of the green propellant alternatives have been considered nor evaluated for an APU application.&nbsp; Work has already been accomplished to characterize and obtain the properties of these 2 propellants.&nbsp; However, the spacecraft are using existing leak detection sensors that are typically used for Hydrazine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Using these green propellants for the APU application requires decrementing their TRL down to 3.&nbsp; This task would aim to establish a TRL of 4 at conclusion by showing a proof of concept with a KSC-instrumented EPU asset at the MSFC Component Development Area (CDA). &nbsp;&nbsp;The task to accomplish this is called Green Application for Space Power or GRASP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A key technical difference (aside from the differences in toxicity) between Hydrazine and the green propellant alternatives is the combustion temperature.&nbsp; Both types of propellants are dispensed from their feed tanks through a catalyst material.&nbsp; The catalyst decomposes (reacts) with each propellant and creates the high temperature exhaust gases that are used to either provide thrust (in the application of a rocket engine) or to spin the turbine which provides power to an APU or EPU.&nbsp; Hydrazine decomposes at 900 deg C while the green propellants decompose at 1600 deg C.&nbsp; However, the existing H-70 catalyst (Shell 405) works best with dual-bonded nitrogen mixtures.&nbsp; Both ADN and HAN offer this dual-bonded feature.&nbsp; Although the green propellants may burn hotter with their own proprietary catalyst material, they will burn cooler with the Shell 405 product.</p><p>Additionally, both propellants are mixed with water and the water content can be increased to further reduce combustion temperatures.&nbsp; For this proposal, KSC will ship their green sensors (either for ADN or HAN) to MSFC and we in turn would instrument the EPU dedicated to that propellant.&nbsp; Following completion of one month of testing the EPU instrumented with leak detection sensors, the hardware would be shipped to DFRC for a ground test inside an F-16 aircraft.&nbsp;* [Selecting Days for Concept and Technology Evaluation in SMART-NAS Test-Bed Scenario Generation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8uc5-ifpr) - Crown Consulting, Inc. will investigate and demonstrate methods to enable rapid selection of days for scenario generation in the development and evaluation of Air Traffic Management concepts and technologies (C&T) in the Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for the National Airspace System (SMART-NAS) Test-bed (SNTB). The proposed capability will enable the rapid generation of highly operationally relevant scenarios for use in the development and evaluation of technology demonstrators such as NASA Airspace Technology Demonstrator, ATD-2 and ATD-3, Unmanned Aerial System Traffic Management, as well as new operational concepts such as Integrated Demand Management and Trajectory Based Operations. 
A significant motivation for the development of the SNTB is enabling C&T benefit, impact, safety and cost assessments for speeding up deployment in the NAS. Today, C&T introduction into the NAS takes decades. The primary reason for this is an inability to assess the operational impact of the interaction between the proposed C&T and operationally deployed systems in terms of NAS-wide safety, traffic flow efficiency, roles and workload of controllers and traffic managers, and impact on airline operations. Human-In-The-Loop testing and shadow-mode evaluation driven by operational data. Slow and incremental steps are typically taken towards deployment because of limitations in the development of mathematical modeling and simulation.
The proposed innovation seeks to augment the scenario generation capability of NASA's SNTB with methods and tools for selecting traffic, winds and weather based on the needs of the experiment allowing for highly operationally relevant scenarios. These methods and tools would actively categorize incoming and historical data using advanced machine-learning algorithms, allowing fast access to NAS streaming and legacy data in a big-data warehouse through queries generated via a simple user interface for specifying desired characteristics.* [Instrumentation For Multiple Radiation Detection Based On Novel Mercurous Halides For Nuclear Planetology, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pvje-mmuf) - We propose a spectrometer that employs a single room temperature semiconductor detector that can perform both gamma and neutron spectroscopy. The proposed detector is based on the novel mercurous halide materials, Hg2X2 (X=I, Cl, Br).  The mercurous halides are new wide band-gap semiconductor detector materials that can provide radiation detection with low cost, high performance and long term stability.  Despite years of research, no explored room temperature semiconductor detection candidates can satisfy all three features simultaneously. At Brimrose, we have successfully developed the growth procedures for high quality Hg2X2 crystals for long wavelength infrared (LWIR) imaging systems. Recently, we have been able to engineer our growth process toward gamma radiation detection and have demonstrated initial encouraging detector response from Hg2I2 to both gamma and alpha particle incident radiations. The focus will be on the material engineering aspect of the detector material itself (i.e., crystal growth and post growth processing), as well as on the detector fabrication and system design.   The proposed mercurous halides-based nuclear instrument can be used onboard NASA's orbiters and landers for space planetology. Specifically, it can be used to determine surface and sub-surface composition of planetary bodies via both gamma spectroscopy and neutron spectroscopy.* [LBA-ECO CD-32 LBA Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-MIP) Forcing Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dm36-3vjc) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides gap-filled meteorological observations from nine Brazilian flux towers for periods between 1999 and 2006. The measurements include: air temperature, specific humidity, module of wind speed, downward long wave and shortwave radiation at the surface, surface pressure, precipitation, and carbon dioxide (CO2). These atmospheric data are provided at 1 hour time-steps. These data were used as the standardized forcing data input for the LBA Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-MIP).The LBA-MIP goal was to gain comparative understanding of ecosystem models that simulate energy, water, and CO2 fluxes over the LBA area. The task was to subject all the models to the same forcing and experimental protocol, and to compare the outputs. The protocol is provided as a companion file, lba_mip_protocol4.0_20100309.pdf.The source meteorological observations for the forcing data, from the nine Brazilian flux towers, were recently published as Saleska, et al. (2013). See related data sets. These source data were gap-filled according to the LBA-MIP standard protocol. Note that the CAX forest tower was not included in the MIP. See the companion file driver_data.pdf for additional gap-filling information.There are 34 data products with this data set and they are provided in both text (.txt) and ALMA-compliant NetCDF (.nc) formats. The files have been compressed into nine *.zip files according to site.* [Millimeter-wave Camera, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nhbq-uru8) - Traditional SAR imaging at millimeter wave frequencies can provide excellent, high SNR, 3D images of features inside dielectric solids.  However, imaging at these frequencies requires thousands of measurements; raster scanning for data collection is time consuming; and data analysis and image rendering requires additional time.  These limitations make millimeter wave SAR imaging for nondestructive evaluation prohibitive outside the lab.  

We propose to show feasibility of overcoming these restrictions by designing a real-time, high-resolution, portable and 3D imaging system for terrestrial and in-space inspection applications.  We will demonstrate ability to produce high-fidelity 3D images from substantially reduced data with minimal image quality degradation.  We will also investigate further enhancements via spectral estimation or compressive sensing techniques.
In Phase I we will design an adaptive, custom sampled, SAR-based millimeter wave imaging system for nondestructive inspection of complex composites and structures.  The design of this imaging system will be based on novel and substantial innovations to a well establish knowledge base.  The innovations involve overcoming hardware and software limitations that currently make 3D imaging at millimeter wave frequencies slow, cumbersome and impractical for widespread use.

Our goal is to design a system with:  center frequency in the millimeter wave range; significant bandwidth; high-spatial and range resolutions; rapid image data collection; real-time image rendering; ability to image multi-layer structures made of different materials; high system dynamic range (high detection sensitivity); electrical and mechanical  design allowing adaptation to use in-space; modular and frequency-scalablity to accommodate large structures; user friendly design to allow operation by people of various skill sets.  The Phase I effort will include simulations and small-scale testing.* [Next Generation UAV Based Spectral Systems for Environmental Monitoring](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ut9x-mpjg) - At present, UAVs used in environmental monitoring mostly collect low spectral resolution imagery, capable of retrieving canopy greenness or properties related water stress. We propose a UAV based capacity for accurate measurement of spectral reflectance at high temporal frequencies and stability to depict diurnal/seasonal cycles in vegetation function. We will test our approaches first using spatially-resolved discrete point measurements characterizing VNIR reflectance and solar-induced fluorescence Y1, followed in Y2 by imaging spectroscopy. The ultimate goal is to produce science-quality spectral data from UAVs suitable for scaling ground measurements and comparison against airborne or satellite sensors. Because of the potential for rapid deployment, spatially explicit data from UAVs can be acquired irrespective of many of the cost, scheduling and logistic limitations to satellite or piloted aircraft missions. Provided that the measurements are suitably calibrated and well characterized, this opens up opportunities for calibration/validation activities not currently available. There is considerable interest in UAVs from the agricultural and forestry industries but there is a need to identify a workflow that yields calibrated comparisons through space and time. This will increase the likelihood that UAVs are economically feasible for applied and basic science, as well as land management. We target the consistent retrieval of calibrated surface reflectance, as well as biological parameters including chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic capacity, nutrient and chlorophyll content, specific leaf area and leaf area index- all important to vegetation monitoring and yield. Scientifically, deployment of UAV sensors at sites such as flux towers will facilitate more frequent (e.g. within-day) and spatially comprehensive assessment of the vegetation physiology and function within tower footprints than is possible by foot, from sensors fixed to the tower, or irregular aircraft missions. We propose a rapid data assimilation and delivery system based on past SensorWeb efforts to move calibrated reflectance data and derived retrievals directly from the UAV to users. We will utilize SensorWeb functionalities to strategically run a data gathering campaign to optimize data yield. As well, we propose a mission deployment system to optimize flight paths based on real-time in-flight data processing to enable effective data collection strategies. All spectral data will also be uploaded to NASA's in-development EcoSIS online spectral library, and we will employ a cloud system to manage the intermediate products. Ultimately, we will demonstrate the acquisition of science-grade spectral measurements from UAVs to advance the use of UAVs in remote sensing beyond current state of application, providing measurements of a quality comparable to those from handheld instruments or well-calibrated air- and spaceborne systems. A key benefit is that UAV collections at 10-150m altitude bridge the gap between ground/proximal measurements and airborne measurements typically acquired at 500m and higher, allowing better linkage of comparable measurements across the full range of scales from the ground to satellites. This proposal is directly responsive to the AIST NRA in that it: bridges the gap in Earth observation between field and airborne measurements; and reduces risk to NASA through development of methods to make well-characterized measurements from UAVs for integration, calibration and validation of NASA satellite and airborne data, makes use of a data delivery system in which measurements and derived products are rapidly distributed to users, and provides spatially explicit data of calibrated reflectance and vegetation traits new temporal and spatial scales not currently available. We submit in the Core Topic area 'Operations Technologies' and are applicable to the 'Ecological Forecasting' subtopic. We will enter at TRL 3 and exit at TRL 5.* [Strain Sensors Based on Sandwich Structures of Crumpled Graphene for Structural Health Monitoring](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y3d7-ezgi) - Space based systems are subject to varied stresses which induce damage leading to failure, therefore it is necessary to develop an onboard system to monitor structural health. The primary components of these systems are compact flexible strain gauges that can be applied to arbitrary structures. Researches have depended on nanomaterials to develop these systems, the most promising of which is graphene, a single atom thick layer of carbon that exhibits excellent mechanical and electrical properties, which has been successfully used in strain sensors, but requires advancement in sensitivity and ease of integration to be useful. Herein is proposed a stacked biaxially textured graphene strain sensor (SBTGRP) for structural health monitoring which takes advantage of the interaction between two mating sheets of textured graphene when subject to strain to measure changes to a system. Crumpled graphene consists of graphene which has been deformed to adopt a crumpled surface; this unique topography offers several advantages in developing strain sensors, most obviously increased conformability. The most interesting possibility for strain sensing is based on the interaction of two layers of textured graphene. Two mating crumpled graphene sheets make contact at the tips of the corrugations on their surfaces, these points of contact serve as electrical connections and the prevalence of these contacts can be gauged by measuring the electrical resistance between the two layers. If this stacked system is stretched the crumpled graphene will begin to adopt a flatter configuration and the height of the corrugations will decrease, reducing the number of contact points, increasing the resistance, and allowing for determination of the strain on the system. We have already developed SBTGRPs for human body motion monitoring but they remain to be optimized for use in structural health monitoring. Development of these sensors will allow for the creation of an integrated health monitoring system which will improve the reliability of future missions by offering a method for life assessment.

The main goals in optimizing SBTGRPs are: perfecting their fabrication method, quantifying their response to various modes of forcing, increasing their sensitivity to the low amplitude strains of interest for structural health monitoring, and integrating multiple strain sensors into an array to achieve full multimodal deformation sensing. While current strain sensors are tested in response to normal strains, in real world applications the systems will be subject to multiple modes of forcing, therefore it is necessary to fully characterize sensor behavior, using tension and torsional testing stages, under these conditions. This series of tests will allow for determination of unique sensor behavior which may be used to differentiate between types of strain as well as gauge their reliability. More importantly, the quality of sensing is dictated by the conditions at the interface, therefore sensitivity could be increased via careful control of the interface characteristics between the two crumpled graphene layers. Of primary interest is determining how the initial degree of crumpling of the upper and lower graphene layers affects sensitivity. A high degree of initial crumpling leads to a large number of interlayer contacts and therefore will require significantly more stretching to generate a significant number of disconnections therefore reducing sensitivity to low strains. Therefore it may be possible to increase sensitivity by reducing the degree of initial crumpling. As a final goal the realized sensors will be integrated into a large scale array for detailed structural health monitoring. Access to NASA facilities, for instance the advanced mechanical testing labs available at the Goddard Spaceflight Center, and researchers would be invaluable in advancing this work to develop devices to improve the reliability of space based systems.* [HPC Benchmark Suite NMx, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mbjm-h7z7) - In the phase II effort, Intelligent Automation Inc., (IAI) and University of Central Florida (UCF) propose to develop a comprehensive numerical test suite for benchmarking current and future high performance computing activities that will include: (1) dense and unsymmetrical matrix problems faced in space aviation and problems in thermally driven structural response and radiation exchange, (2) implicit solution algorithms with production models and benchmarks for indefinite matrices and pathological cases, (3) configurations scaling for large systems in shared, distributed and mixed memory conditions, (4) documentation for strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the toolkits used together with recommendations and (5) precision and round-off studies on serial and parallel machines, comparison of solutions on serial and parallel hardware with study of wall clock performance with respect to the number of processors

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

The MERRA-Land product, MST1NXMLD or tavg1_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional time averaged single-level at the native resolution. All collections from this group are at reduced horizontal resolution.

The data are on the GEOS-5 native 540 x 361 grid with 0.667 degree longitude x 0.5 degree latitude resolution. Data are archived in the HDF-EOS2 (Grid) format, based on HDF4.

The SWIFT software defined radio is a proven, SWaP-C (size, weight, power, and cost) efficient RF communications, signal processing, and general computing platform delivering on-orbit reprogrammability and flexibility for space missions. TUI plans to investigate and implement cognitive radio technologies on the SWIFT platform that will reduce mission planning and mission implementation costs by providing a standardized, robust, hardware and software platform that can dynamically adjust to a rapidly changing space communications environment. By using the mature SWIFT radio as a basis for integrating these solutions, and implementing NASA's STRS standard for radio software, TUI is in a strong position to continue research and develop cognitive radio solutions that benefit a wide variety of NASA science missions and future radio customers through tested, reusable, and portable software and firmware.* [Scotch-Tape Mirror for Hard X-rays Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/39pm-6xrw) - <p>The Scotch-Tape Mirror for Hard X-rays project is to test the possibility of building a grazing incidence mirror for hard X-rays (E&gt;20 keV) using a &ldquo;scotch-tape&rdquo; design, in which a thin plastic tape with a specific thickness profile and a multilayer reflective coating is tightly wound into a roll. The goal is to find a low-cost way of building a telescope for hard X-rays with a very large effective area.<br />&nbsp;</p> <p>The project is to build a grazing incidence mirror for hard X-rays (E&gt;20 keV) using a &ldquo;scotch-tape&rdquo; design, in which a thin plastic tape with a specific thickness profile and a multilayer reflective coating is tightly wound into a roll. Key challenges are (a) to find a suitably smooth tape substrate (this has been done), (b) to wind a large number of tape shells onto the smooth metal centerpiece without introducing and accumulating shape irregularities, and (c) to give the tape the variable thickness profile in order to achieve the desired optical figure. Our immediate goal is to demonstrate the idea feasibility by building a crude conical X-ray concentrator. If successful, we will aim at building and flying a mirror prototype on a balloon and then proposing for an Explorer mission or MOO. The ultimate goal is a telescope with 1 m^2 effective area at E=30 keV.<br />&nbsp;</p>* [Low-Cost and High-Performance Propulsion for Small Satellite Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bveu-zaiw) - While small satellites continue to show immense promise for high-capability and low-cost missions, they remain limited by post-deployment propulsion for a variety of activities like precision maneuvering, orbit change and controlled re-entry / recovery. Furthermore, any on-board propulsion system capable of providing sufficiently high delta-V is likely to impose constraints on handling, storage, operations and safety that may limit consideration as a secondary payload. Ventions proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a compact, light-weight and low-cost 3U cubesat propulsion system that uses non-toxic propellants to provide approximately 125m/sec of delta-V within a 1kg and 100mm x 100mm x 100mm mass and size budget.* [A Compact In Situ Sensor for Measurement of Absorption and Backscattering in Natural Waters, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vkm5-5gjt) - We propose to develop an active sensor for in situ measurement of the inherent optical properties (IOPs) absorption and backscattering at multiple wavelengths. Multi- or hyper-spectral absorption of particles and dissolved materials is routinely measured in the laboratory and in situ in order to characterize, for example, the quantities and types of phytoplankton based on concentrations of specific absorbing pigments. Similarly, backscattering is employed to estimate the concentration of suspended material. Measurements of absorption and backscattering concurrently, and at multiple wavelengths, are useful as proxies for biogeochemical measurements such as particle composition, concentration of particulate organic carbon, and particle size distribution, as well as for remote sensing calibration and validation.
The current state of the art for phytoplankton observation using optical sensors on autonomous platforms relies on linking biomass with optical backscattering and chlorophyll. The ability to quantify phytoplankton using absorption not only overcomes limitations of backscattering and fluorescence-based approaches, but multi-spectral (visible wavelength) measurements of absorption also provide the means to discern the presence of accessory pigments and pigment packaging, ultimately leading to not only improvements in phytoplankton biomass estimates, but also the potential for resolving phytoplankton functional types.
Briefly, the proposed sensor emits a collimated beam of light into the water and measures the backscattered light as a radial function from the beam location. An inversion algorithm is then used to convert this backscattered intensity as a function of distance from the beam to the inherent optical properties absorption and backscattering. Multiple source wavelengths are used and the sensor is packaged in a compact, flat-faced geometry easing integration into autonomous platforms.* [Enabling closed-loop control of high degree-of-freedom soft robotic structures](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sbx8-cz6z) - To expand the nation’s capabilities for space exploration, a new approach to robotic manipulation is proposed. The approach utilizes soft materials to create an extremely dexterous manipulator which can accurately control its pose without use of an external sensor. This enables safe interaction between robotic systems, tools, and humans in cluttered spacecraft. Unlike more conventional robots made out of hard plastics and metals, the robot can be manufactured, expanded, and repaired onboard spacecraft. During launch, the majority of the robot’s materials can be stored as a liquid in jars. When the mission requires a robot, the standardized modules can simply be cast inside a standardized mold, combined with their circuitry, and assembled into the desired configuration. Training of the robot is done in a shape-agnostic fashion, allowing the approach to be applied to arbitrary manipulator configurations, in addition to broader classes of objects including robotic fabrics.* [IPA-IPY Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP) Snapshot Borehole Inventory, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ssrw-vqte) - During the planning and implementation of the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007 - 2009, the International Permafrost Association (IPA) coordinated the acquisition of permafrost temperature data under the Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP) Project #50. The TSP project goals included the acquisition of standardized temperature measurements (snapshots) from all permafrost regions on Earth, preparation of a global data set, and development of maps of contemporary permafrost temperatures. As a result of the project, networks of boreholes, equipped for long-term permafrost temperature observations, were established and consist of approximately 860 boreholes in both hemispheres with more than 25 participating countries. Approximately 350 of the boreholes were drilled and instrumented during the IPY period under various nationally funded projects. Comparison of the current Mean Annual Ground Temperature (MAGT) and historical data allows participating countries and other users to assess the thermal state of permafrost dynamics over the last several decades. The TSP project also included active layer measurements, many of which are observed annually under the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) project. Future plans are for these networks to become part of an international network of permafrost observatories with data available for monitoring and multidisciplinary research in both polar and non-polar permafrost regions.

This data set consists of an inventory of these boreholes in two Excel spreadsheets &mdash; one by country (TSP_Borehole_inventory_countries.xls) and one as a composite (TSP_borehole_inventory_composite.xls) for ease in searching. The spreadsheets include the geographic coordinates of the boreholes, elevation, depth of borehole (BH), year drilled, the MAGT, permafrost (PF) thickness, country, responsible person, affiliation, and sponsors. A summary of the number and type of boreholes by country is provided in a PDF document (N_and_S_hemisphere_borehole_summary.pdf), and a high-resolution JPEG image of the borehole locations (TSP_BoreHoles_location_map_highres.jpg) is also included. The inventory lists boreholes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres with 790 of the boreholes located in the Northern Hemisphere. The inventory primarily concentrates on measurements from new and existing boreholes from 2007 to 2009. For historical purposes, some boreholes active since the 1980s are included. Boreholes are classified as four different types: surface (SU) &lt;10 m, shallow (SH) 10-25 m, intermediate (IB) 25-125 m, and deep (DB) &gt;125 m according to the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) classification. For Antarctica, the surface boreholes are split into two subclasses: &lt;SU (&lt;2 m) and SU (2-10 m). The TSP is a field component of the <a href="http://www.gtnp.org">Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost</a> (www.gtnp.org).

Data from over 500 of these boreholes are presented and discussed in a series of papers in the special IPY - TSP issue of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.v21:2/issuetoc">Permafrost and Periglacial Processes</a> (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.v21:2/issuetoc) that include five regional papers and one synthesis paper.

The TSP Snapshot Inventory was compiled and edited from individual sources by Alexander Kholodov, Permafrost Laboratory, Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and Jerry Brown, President (2003-2008), International Permafrost Association.* [Lab on a Chip LCVR Polarimeter for Exploration of Life Signatures, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ypsr-v3h6) - Life on Earth is unique in many ways; one of its great mysteries is that the building blocks of life on Earth (amino acids, nucleotides, sugars) are all chiral. One optical isomer of each amino acid or nucleic acid was selected by evolution. In our pursuit of finding life on Mars and beyond (Triton, Europa, etc.), it is likely that one of the clues to extant or extinct life could be the detection of non-racemic chiral molecules. This proposal describes the development of a highly miniaturized and ultrasensitive lab-on-a-chip polarimeter that will meet the NASA need to measure chirality in very small volumes of samples at very high sensitivity. The proposal builds on a novel technology that is based on a proprietary design, in which a modulated liquid crystal variable retarder (LCVR) enhances sensitivity and reduces size without sacrificing performance. This detection principle with a long-path-length microfluidic flow cell allows for the measurement of chirality in microliter volumes of samples. The Phase I effort has conclusively demonstrated the technical feasibility of the detection principle.  A miniaturized polarimeter with microfluidic flow cell was designed and fabricated. The polarimeter was calibrated and tested with samples. In Phase II, we will build, fully characterize, and deliver a miniature polarimeter with optimized performance, enhanced mechanical stability, and integrated fluid handling capability. The primary goals are to further improve the polarimeter's sensitivity, accuracy, size, weight, reproducibility, measurement speed, and power needs, conduct extensive testing, and  deliver a robust prototype, engineering drawings, software, and test results to NASA.* [SMEX03 ENVISAT ASAR Data, Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fqx4-kyhe) - This data set is comprised of browse images acquired over the regional study areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma USA as part of the 2003 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX03). The experiment was conducted from March through July 2003 via the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument on board the European Space Agency's (ESA) Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT). Cross-polarized C-band ASAR images were acquired in order to obtain a backscatter coefficient measurement over a range of natural vegetation types. However, the images provided here are only browse images and therefore cannot be used to derive backscatter coefficient values. Researchers interested in backscatter coefficient values must obtain the ASAR data. The total volume for this combined data set is approximately 65 megabytes. Data are available via FTP and are provided as JPEG image files and JGW georeference files. Also included and available via FTP are the following types of header files: HAN files, ASCII text files, and INI files.

These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.* [SMEX03 AMSR-E Daily Gridded Soil Moisture and Brightness Temperatures, Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2hi7-36tu) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC.

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

  The MERRA-Land product, MST1NXMLD or tavg1_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional time averaged single-level at the native resolution. All collections from this group are at reduced horizontal resolution.

Data are archived in the HDF-EOS (Grid) format, based on HDF4.* [Leveraging Active Knit Technologies for Aerospace Pressure Suit Applications](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uiz7-3ebz) - Anti-Gravity Suits (AGS) are garments used in astronautics to prevent crew from experiencing orthostatic intolerance (OI) and consequential blackouts while performing takeoff, reentry, and landing tasks. The literature sites 83% of astronauts who return from long duration missions lasting longer than one month experience cardiovascular deconditioning while in microgravity conditions; therefore, cardiovascular health will become increasingly important to advance missions outside of low earth orbit (LEO) (e.g. The Journey to Mars). Pressure suits, specifically AGS, are critical to preventing orthostatic intolerance (OI) while performing takeoff, reentry, and landing tasks.  More broadly, pressure suits enable astronauts to maintain homeostasis in vacuum conditions and are required during all extravehicular activities (EVA). Mobility is a critical factor and current limitation to both AGS and Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) designs stemming predominantly from the fact that they are inflated and therefore stiff.  Efforts have been made to revise current gas pressurized pressure suits and replace them with mechanical knit pressure suits, which are garments designed using passive, elastic materials, such as knits (fabrics made of interlooping stretch yarns).  However, mechanical pressure suits are difficult to don/doff and are not able to exert dynamic or controllable pressure on the body.

Active textiles are an emerging area of research that could advance the capabilities of aerospace pressure suit design by contracting on command.  Shape Memory Alloys (SMA), for example, are active materials with pseudoelastic properties and can be engineered to "remember" prescribed forms through an annealing process. Traditional knit architectures can be engineered to produce contraction if individual yarns incorporate SMA wire. Consequently, if a knit garment is constructed using an SMA wire, the garment could dynamically generate large displacements and contractive forces across the fabric surface and could turn on/off or achieve various compression levels. 

Contracting SMA knit technology can be leveraged to compress the body like a braided finger trap, applying tension across a large surface area. An ideal SMA knit used for an active AGS would exhibit a contraction sufficient to generate the required counter-pressure output for AGS/OI applications with minimal elongation because the height of the wearer is a constant. The methods/techniques for designing active SMA knit materials for an AGS design will focus on the assessment of SMA knit samples based on their magnitude of shape change, force generation and pressure output. Voltage, wire gauge, wire diameter, and number of courses containing SMA wire will each be varied to assess their effect on these three variables.  

An SMA knit AGS could provide a controllable, mobile and untethered garment that can create (or relieve) compression on the user.  Leveraging SMA knit technology in compression garment design has a huge potential for improving aerospace pressure suits, which are critical for astronaut health and wellbeing as we transition to a new era in human space exploration.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/buwa-k2c3) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [Adaptive Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2799-aa4w) - The ADEPT project is a new, advanced heat shield design to protect payloads and landers delivered to planetary bodies with atmospheres.  ADEPT is a mechanically deployable heatshield, like an umbrella, that can open up at planet arrival to diameters 2-5 times greater than current rigid heatshields.  This large size overcomes the current limitations of NASA's heatshields to enable delivery of 10s of metric tons to Mars' surface - essential for human exploration.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_ultrarapid](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tuwp-ijme) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites. These orbits are determined sub-daily (ultra-rapid generation), daily (rapid generation), and weekly (final IGS product). The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator retrieves these individual solutions and generates the official IGS combined orbit products. The orbits generated by the individual ACs and the combination products generated by the ACCs are available at the CDDIS. These orbits can be used to determine precise coordinates of the observing stations, gravity field parameters, and Earth orientation parameters. The Ultra-rapid products are available for real time and near real time use and include predicted orbit information.* [Metrics for Offline Evaluation of Prognostic Performance](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5p2w-8pvp) - Prognostic performance evaluation has gained significant attention in the past few years.*Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part due to the varied end- user requirements for different applications, time scales, available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name a few. The research community has used a variety of metrics largely based on convenience and their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing a standardized approach to compare different efforts. This paper presents several new evaluation metrics tailored for prognostics that were recently introduced and were shown to effectively evaluate various algorithms as compared to other conventional metrics. Specifically, this paper presents a detailed discussion on how these metrics should be interpreted and used. These metrics have the capability of incorporating probabilistic uncertainty estimates from prognostic algorithms. In addition to quantitative assessment they also offer a comprehensive visual perspective that can be used in designing the prognostic system. Several methods are suggested to customize these metrics for different applications. Guidelines are provided to help choose one method over another based on distribution characteristics. Various issues faced by prognostics and its performance evaluation are discussed followed by a formal notational framework to help standardize subsequent developments.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Time Average 1-hourly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sh9r-winy) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present.

(Ir) X-ray mirror coating technology that can be used for the
construction of high-resolution X-ray telescopes comprising thin-shell
mirror substrates, such as the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) currently
being developed for the Constellation-X mission.  The urgent need for
low-stress Ir coating technology is driven by the current limitations on
telescope angular resolution resulting from substrate distortions caused
by conventional reflective Ir coatings that have high stress.  In
particular, we have measured film stresses in excess of 3 GPa in the
case of 30 nm Ir films deposited by conventional magnetron sputtering
techniques.  The distortions in thin glass mirror shells (such as those
suitable for the Constellation-X SXT) resulting from these extremely
large coating stresses presently make the largest contribution to the
SXT telescope imaging error budget, of order 10 arcsec or more.
Consequently, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to meet the
imaging requirements of Constellation-X, or other future high-resolution
X-ray missions, unless high-quality Ir coatings having significantly
lower stresses can be developed.  The development of such coatings is
precisely the aim of our proposal.* [Nimbus-7 SMMR Antenna Temperatures](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wrdp-sfnv) - The SMMR Antenna Temperatures (Nimbus-7) data set consists of antenna temperatures from passive microwave radiometers aboard NOAA's Nimbus-7 satellite. The instrument is the Scanning Multichannel Microwave
Radiometer (SMMR). Each file consists of one days worth of data in
swath format, i.e. the portion of the Earth's surface viewed by the
scanning radiometer. Antenna temperature data are available from NSIDC
from October 1978 to August 1987.
 SMMR was a ten channel passive microwave instrument using six
conventional Dicke-type radiometers. It delivered orthogonally
polarized antenna temperature data at five frequencies (6.6, 10.69,
18.0 21.0 and 37.0 GHz). The two 37.0 GHz radiometers operated
continuously for each polarization. The other radiometers alternated
polarizations on alternate scans. The size of each daily file is 35 MBytes. The data are distributed on FTP. Copies of the data
format description are available upon request from NSIDC.

The scanner operated only on alternate days, due to spacecraft power
limitations. There are typically at least 14 days of coverage per
month, although major data gaps occur in August: in August, 1982, the
4th, 8th, and 16th are missing for both polar regions; in August,
1984, the 13th through the 23rd are missing for both polar regions.* [Non Thermal Plasma Assisted Catalytic Reactor for CO2 Methanation, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q8n4-4jji) - In situ production of methane as propellant by methanation of CO2, also called Sabatier reaction, is a key enabling technology required for sustainable and affordable human exploration of Mars. The Sabatier reaction is conventionally carried out in a fixed bed catalyst at high temperatures of 350-400 ?C. For the long duration future Mars missions (~ 18 months expected stay on Mars), the fixed bed Sabatier reactor design however is inadequate due to performance and catalyst durability issues. In addition thermal management within the reactor is a major issue due to exothermicity of the reaction. Lynntech has demonstrated the feasibility of a novel low power, low temperature plasma assisted catalysis process for addressing these limitations with the methanation of CO2 at a scale of 14 g/h methane production rate. In the Phase II project, Lynntech proposes to build and demonstrate a full scale (0.55 kg/h methane production rate) Sabatier reactor for NASA application. The anticipated Technology Readiness Level at the beginning and ending of Phase II will be 3 and 4, respectively.* [MODIS/Terra Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 1km Subsetted V005](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ygwf-7rrp) - This data type (MOD02SSH) is a subsample from the MODIS Level 1B 1-km data.
                        Every fifth pixel is taken from the MOD021KM product and written out to
                        MOD02SSH. The subsampling starts at the third frame, and at the third line.
                        Here, "frame" and "line" are naming conventions for pixels along and across the
                        scan, respectively. Since MOD02SSH is a subsampled Level 1B , many things from
                        the Level 1B documentation apply as well. That is, the MOD02SSH data product
                        contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 36 bands generated
                        from MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance (MOD 01). The radiance units are in
                        W/(m ^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including quality flags, error
                        estimates and calibration data. Visible, shortwave infrared (SWIR), and Near
                        Infrared (NIR) measurements are made during daytime only, while radiances for
                        Thermal Infrared (TIR) are measured continuously.
                        
                        As it's parent, the MOD02SSH is in HDF-EOS format, and all metadata structures
                        and names are preserved for better convenience. However, some relevant changes
                        are made where appropriate. E.g. the dimension mappings are updated to reflect
                        the new one-to-one correspondance between the data and geolocations. The latter
                        is one of the most important differences: in the MOD02SSH, there is no offset
                        between data and geolocation pixels. The spatial coverage is almost similar to
                        that from MOD021KM (nominally it is 2330 by 2030 km, cross-track by
                        along-track, respectively). The MOD02SSH is produced continuously, and thus the
                        processing provides 2-day repeat observations of the Earth with a repeat orbit
                        pattern every 16 days.

                        The V004 Program Executable (PGE), for MODIS Level 1B products, has gone
                        through a series of revisions since the initial release of V4.0.0 in March of
                        2002. These include revisions to make it LINUX-compatible. The current version
                        is V4.0.9, which does not contain changes to the code that affect scientific
                        output.
                        
                        Below is a brief overview of changes that affect scientific output in previous
                        versions (V4.0.0 to V4.0.7) of PGE code. The MCST web site, listed in the URL
                        section of this DIF, has a more detailed version of this information, including
                        revisions that do not affect scientific output.
                        
                        Significant changes to Look Up Tables (LUT) used in Level 1B processing have
                        occurred. These include revising the Response-versus-Scan Angle (RVS) LUTs from

The flow-angle and airspeed sensor system  (FASS) will provide airspeed with practically zero-lag and to less than one knot accuracy and flow angularity to a fraction of a degree, with natural immunity to EMI and RFI. Unlike Pitot-static and other conventional techniques, which experience serious limitations in accuracy, pneumatic lags, and frequency response in thin upper atmospheres, FASS will measure airspeed all the way to zero knots and perform equally well at sea level as well at high altitudes and even in the thin Martian atmosphere. The FASS addresses important flight-operation and flight research problems with crucial impact on vehicle performance, stability & control, structural loads, and pilot action. FASS will permit easy integration with aircraft avionics systems including conventional instruments used for pressure, temperature, and density measurements. Sensor elements will be coated to withstand harsh environment and waterproofed for underwater applications. FASS will be developed and marketed both as a stand-alone device and as an embedded, non-intrusive system. Commercial applications include aerospace vehicles, submarines, ships, boats, atmospheric wind sensing, oceanographic measurements, and tall structures.* [Use-Driven Testbed for Evaluating Systems and Technologies (U-TEST), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rsud-kchd) - The limitations of current airspace management have necessitated the
planning and development of the Next Generation Air Transportation
System (NextGen). NextGen seeks to change the fundamental structure of
airspace management to increase the safety and efficiency of flight
operations. This effort will require the introduction of advanced flight
deck technologies capable of meeting NextGen requirements, such as
assimilating weather information into navigation displays. To rigorously
evaluate the effectiveness of these new human-machine interface designs,
we propose the Use-driven Testbed for Evaluating Systems and
Technologies (U-TEST). This proposed innovation will provide a platform
for collecting and integrating human performance measures for evaluating
NextGen technologies in simulated environments. At the core of U-TEST
will be a data integration platform that combines multiple data streams
(i.e. observer-based, system-based, and self-report measures), producing
a comprehensive evaluation of pilot performance using novel systems and
technologies. The 3D Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) will
serve as a vehicle for U-TEST development during this SBIR effort.
System engineers can utilize the U-TEST environment to acquire rapid,
comprehensive, and cost-effective feedback to inform the modification of
emerging flight deck systems.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jheh-3e5e) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [Real-time Ethylene Sensor Based on Chemical Anisotropic Nanochannel Impedance Spectroscopy, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dx88-8rwt) - NASA has need of a real-time sensor capable of <25ppb detection of ethylene for off-world greenhouse monitoring. NanoLab proposes the use of a fundamentally new style of sensor based off of anisotropic impedance analysis of vertically aligned nanotube arrays (VANTA). Specifically, we propose the use of chemical anisotropic nanochannel impedance spectroscopy (CANIS). This style of sensor provides up to eight degrees of analytical freedom, resulting in extreme discrimination between chemical species without requiring modification of the sensor to provide selectivity. For the particular application of ethylene sensing, NanoLab proposes the use of a carbon nanotube based CANIS sensor, sensitized to improve the interaction of ethylene with the surface, using either a metal or metal organic coating, in order to lower the limit of detection. The sensor will be self-referencing to minimize drift, and will be capable of simultaneously monitoring other relevant species, such as water, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and ammonia without interference to the detection of ethylene. The sensor will be lightweight, and have a footprint of 1cm x 1cm.* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Aerosol Index Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ycny-j56d) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Aerosol Index Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

These are, so far, the highest spatial resolution thermal data ever obtained for Mars. Four slightly overlapping thermal panoramas (also called scans or swaths) cover a large portion of the equatorial region from 30 deg.S to 6 deg.N latitude. Simultaneous visible panoramas were taken during each of the four observing sessions; due to spacecraft memory limitations, visible channel processing was stopped early relative to the thermal channel for 2 of the sessions (2 and 4). Thus, the visible channel panoramas are shorter than the thermal panoramas for these sessions. These data are saved for historical reasons; they are not considered to be of archival quality.* [Distributed Leak Detection System Using Structure-Borne Noise, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jz98-3stw) - Manned spacecraft are vulnerable to air leaks caused by micrometeorite
and space debris impact.  The ability to detect and quickly locate and
mitigate a pressure vessel breach is critical to the safety of any long
duration spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or a
proposed lunar base or mission to Mars.  Current NASA protocol for
finding a spacecraft leak uses a handheld ultrasonic directional
microphone, similar to those widely deployed industrially, to detect the
40 kHz airborne ultrasonic hiss generated by the downstream leak
turbulence.  However, known limitations exist regarding the use of
airborne ultrasonic emissions for locating leaks in the spacecraft
environment because the downstream side of the leak occurs into the
vacuum of space, creating reduced leak noise inside the pressure vessel.
Blockages of the transmission of airborne ultrasonic energy by
structural components, avionics, and equipment racks also limit the
detection range of such systems.  An alternative approach that we
propose is to monitor the spacecraft structure itself---the pressure
vessel skin---for leak-generated surface-borne ultrasound by means of a
flexible and modular electronics package with fully integrated surface
sensor arrays, data acquisition electronics, and radio frequency
communication capabilities.* [Plug Load Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q9cy-stcj) - We provide MATLAB binary files (.mat) and comma separated values files of data collected from a pilot study of a plug load management system that allows for the metering and control of individual electrical plug loads. The study included 15 power strips, each containing 4 channels (receptacles), which wirelessly transmitted power consumption data approximately once per second to 3 bridges. The bridges were connected to a building local area network which relayed data to a cloud-based service. Data were archived once per minute with the minimum, mean, and maximum power draw over each one minute interval recorded. The uncontrolled portion of the testing spanned approximately five weeks and established a baseline energy consumption. The controlled portion of the testing employed schedule-based rules for turning off selected loads during non-business hours; it also modified the energy saver policies for certain devices.

Three folders are provided: “matFilesAllChOneDate” provides a MAT-file for each date, each file has all channels; “matFilesOneChAllDates” provides a MAT-file for each channel, each file has all dates; “csvFiles” provides comma separated values files for each date (note that because of data export size limitations, there are 10 csv files for each date). Each folder has the same data; there is no practical difference in content, only the way in which it is organized.* [Privacy Preservation through Random Nonlinear Distortion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ugj6-i2sw) - Consider a scenario in which the data owner has some private or sensitive data and wants a data miner to access them for studying important patterns without revealing the sensitive information. Privacy-preserving data mining aims to solve this problem by randomly transforming the data prior to their release to the data miners. Previous works only considered the case of linear data perturbations - additive, multiplicative, or a combination of both - for studying the usefulness of the perturbed output. In this paper, we discuss nonlinear data distortion using potentially nonlinear random data transformation and show how it can be useful for privacy-preserving anomaly detection from sensitive data sets. We develop bounds on the expected accuracy of the nonlinear distortion and also quantify privacy by using standard definitions. The highlight of this approach is to allow a user to control the amount of privacy by varying the degree of nonlinearity. We show how our general transformation can be used for anomaly detection in practice for two specific problem instances: a linear model and a popular nonlinear model using the sigmoid function. We also analyze the proposed nonlinear transformation in full generality and then show that, for specific cases, it is distance preserving. A main contribution of this paper is the discussion between the invertibility of a transformation and privacy preservation and the application of these techniques to outlier detection. The experiments conducted on real-life data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.* [LBA-ECO LC-39 MODIS Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gumw-g2hg) - This data set provides active fire locations and estimates of annual fire frequencies for South America from 2000-2007. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm. There are 14 data files with this data set: 7 GeoTIFF (.tif) files of fire frequency at MODIS 250 m resolution, where each grid cell value represents the number of days in that year on which active fires were detected, and 7 shape files of active fire locations for the years 2001-2007.* [IRAS MINOR PLANET SURVEY ASTEROIDS V5.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s5mh-xmjd) - Derived diameters and albedoes of asteroids, plus associated data on sighting and non-sightings, extracted from the IRAS archives.* [Using Real-Time Lexical Indicators to Detect Performance Decrements in Spaceflight Teams: A Methodology to Dynamically Monitor Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Mechanisms That Influence Performance](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5p2z-bpjx) - To date, we have collected data from HERA Campaign 1 (C1M1 – C1M4), HERA Campaign 2 (C2M1 – C2M4), and NEEMO18. The Year 1 effort was to conduct a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in the Year 1 HERA analogs. This was accomplished, demonstrating that (a) lexical measures can distinguish between high stress and nominal stress in HERA, (b) these measures are consistent with traditional pen and paper measures of stress, and (c) they show sensitivity to variations in stress levels. However, it is important to note that our goal in this project is to develop and test a lexical analysis tool that is tailored for, and optimized to, the LDSF (long duration space flight) environment, rather than simply apply an existing lexical analysis program. That is, we proposed to develop a lexical analysis tool, STRESSnet, that is specifically tailored to assess stress effects in the LDSF environment. This requires that we base this tool on a comprehensive model of the stress domain that draws on existing theory on stress, performance, and well-being, and that we incorporate terms drawn from the existing spaceflight corpus.     
In Year 1, at the direction of the project sponsors, we had to shift our focus immediately to testing a preliminary version of STRESSnet in HERA1 to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Thus, the methodological development of the STRESSnet tool was accelerated to meet this schedule, resulting in a quickly-composed scale that was suitable for testing.     
In Year 2, we are able to perform the more detailed, iterative tasks that are required for the development of the STRESSnet dictionaries. Therefore, there are two primary YR2 tasks that were performed: (1) Data collection and analysis of HERA C2M1 – C2M4 (analyses are still ongoing). (2) Tool revision and elaboration to derive the STRESSnet lexical dictionaries. This report focuses on the tool development task. The products of this task are the searchable dictionaries of lexical terms to assess stress and related states.     
To derive these dictionaries, we first developed a comprehensive model of stress, performance, and well-being. Guided by this model, we derived five major stress dimensions to be examined (attentional focus, cognitive load, anxiety, negative emotion, and social impairment), as well as a number of sub-facets within each core dimension. To develop lexical measures for each sub-facet (such as sadness), we first scavenged existing sources (available scales, questionnaires, existing lexical dictionaries, as well as reviewing Johnson Space Center (JSC) mission transcripts) to develop an initial inventory of terms reflecting that sub-facet or construct. We then initiated a series of iterative ratings of these word lists in order to include additional relevant terms and exclude irrelevant terms.* [Temperature-Modulated Radiative Coatings for Dynamic Thermal Management of Spacecraft](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y72a-666f) - During the course of its mission, a spacecraft is often exposed to significant thermal cycling. Hardware components, such as batteries, transmitters, etc. will only operate within a comparatively smaller range of temperatures. Therefore a thermal management system (TMS) must be developed to maintain the spacecraft's temperature at an operable level throughout the mission. One function of the TMS is to regulate the spacecraft's radiative heat transfer with the environment. Passive radiation coatings are a desirable way to achieve this since they require no electrical input and typically add a negligible amount of mass.

This proposal discusses wavelength-selective, temperature-modulated multilayer coatings which can be used to control the radiative heat transfer between the environment and the spacecraft. If the spacecraft's temperature is too high, the radiation coating can help to reduce the temperature through enhanced thermal emission by selectively emitting in the mid-infrared. Conversely, if the spacecraft temperature is too low, a highly reflective radiation coating can prevent further temperature decrease by minimizing thermal loss. The proposed coatings will combine both functionalities to provide temperature-modulated variable emissivity and improved thermal control. The temperature-modulated properties are achieved through the incorporation of a thermochromic transition material, vanadium dioxide. Currently a Fabry-Perot resonance cavity provides the wavelength-selectivity of the design, however other structures such as nanoparticle layers, gratings, and nanopillars, will be investigated. Alternative tunable materials, such as graphene or other transition materials, will also be explored.

This multifaceted proposal covers four areas: coating design, sample fabrication and characterization, metrology development, and device level testing. A general methodology to analyze and optimize multilayer radiation coatings that incorporate a thermochromic transition material has already been defined and used to model the radiative properties of several preliminary structures. Likewise, development of the metrology systems needed to characterize the samples' radiative properties, including an all-in-one cryogenic-to-high-temperature spectroscopic platform, is in progress. Variable emissivity coatings will be fabricated, characterized, tested at the systems level, and iteratively improved to deliver a dynamic radiative coating which has the potential to significantly advance NASA's exploratory mission capabilities. The findings of this research would address the TA14.2 space technology roadmap objective.* [Sensitive, selective nanoantenna-based biosensor platform for compact, in-situ exo-life detection and astronaut life support](https://data.nasa.gov/d/amf9-x5gb) - We aim to develop a new nanotechnology-enabled sensing platform exceeding the sensitivity and selectivity of the current state-of-art (SOA) in portable, low-mass, low-complexity biochemical sensors. This system is a new capability for space exploration/science applications, e.g. exo-life detection in challenging cryogenic environments, including multiplexed arrays in planetary probes, distributed sensor swarms for use with CubeSats, and other platforms, and builds upon our existing efforts at both NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and Dartmouth College.  

Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) – the collective electron oscillations excited in nano-sized metallic particles (‘nanoantennas’) by incident optical light – have been utilized extensively as sensitive, label-free optical probes for the study of biochemical interactions in both gas and liquid phase, due to their highly confined electric fields and extreme sensitivity to changes in their local environment (e.g. the presence of a target biomolecule.)  The ultimate limit of detection – single molecule detection – has been demonstrated with such sensing platforms, and will form the basis of our sensing approach. Yet, the selective capture of rare targets from a complex background near these transducers remains both a challenging problem and necessary step to advance this technology out of the lab and into the field. Therefore, we aim to close this critical knowledge gap in the current proposal, through the development of the tailored nano-recognition elements coupled to sensitive plasmonic nanoantennas. We will primarily focus on exo-life applications – as these are currently the most challenging and least understood – but with further application to astronaut life support, pathogen detection, and water quality monitoring.  

Field-deployable LSPR-based sensors are currently being explored for terrestrial point-of-care (POC) medical applications by other groups, including our external collaborator for this award at Dartmouth College. These devices are also conducive to the demanding requirements of space exploration, owing to their low-mass, volume, and power consumption, and ruggedization/simplicity in operation. Further, their small size, and relatively low cost with high sensitivity provide capabilities not possible with larger, more complex, centralized instruments (e.g. mass spectrometer). However, LSPR-based sensors (and mass spectrometers) are limited in their demonstrated ability to selectively capture and uniquely identify the target analytes in-situ (in possibly challenging environments), with minimal processing/contamination. This proposal is aimed at enabling this critical step towards a new class of chemical/biochemical measurements for space exploration applications.  

The goal is to advance the SOA in selective capture and sensitive detection of rare biomarkers in-situ, using small, portable, deployable biosensor platforms, with a particular focus on exo-life detection, and possible extension/application to in-flight astronaut life support (including water quality monitoring, health diagnostics, and pathogen detection).* [In-Situ / In-Flight Detection of Fluorescent Proteins Using Imaging Spectroscopy Sensors, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3nc7-ixfn) - The proposal addresses technologies relevant to NASA's new Vision for Space Explorations in the areas of robotics, teleoperations, and macro and micro imaging systems, while developing a generic biology research facility.

In order to carry out NASA's new vision of exploration and prepare for eventual human presence beyond Low Earth Orbit and on the surface of the Moon, Mars, and beyond, we must collec-tively understand how life and specific biological systems adapt, respond, and thrive in these unique environments.  Planning for extended human presence in the reduced gravity environ-ments of the Moon and Mars will require a solid biological understanding from the sub-cellular to the whole organism level.

The proposed facility supports space-based technologies that enable cross-species comparative biological research and will include in-situ autonomous capability to extract genetic, genomic, proteomic, and metabolic information while providing tools to utilize and interpret such data.  Of critical importance is the incorporation and utilization of these monitoring and control systems that will successfully accommodate and adapt to the changing needs of biological systems or specimens over long periods of time.

The facility will be the first scientific payload equipped with automated in-situ technology that allows detection and analysis of fluorescence, which is crucial to the fundamental understanding of biological properties of cellular, sub-cellular, and whole organisms during exploration of space and planets.* [Advanced Long-Range Video Capabilities Using Speckle Imaging Techniques, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u93d-scvb) - Flight-testing is a crucial component in NASA's mission to research and develop new aeronautical concepts because it allows for verification of simulated and wind-tunnel experiments and exposes previously unforeseen design problems. Video is an invaluable tool for flight-testing, allowing the collection of a wealth of information such as craft position, speed, health, as well as tracking different phases of flight, capturing events, extracting performance figures, and documenting historical flights.  For several cases of interest (high-speed/high-altitude aircraft, lakebed remote landings, vehicle re-entry, smoke airflow traces, etc.) it is not feasible or physically possible to install external cameras close to the aircraft whose behavior is being filmed.  Long-range imaging equipment is typically used in these cases, but the captured footage is severely limited in quality by atmospheric effects, which are often the dominating source of image degradation, long before diffraction-related limitations occur.  In consequence, long-range imagery typically suffers from scintillation, blurring, poor spatial resolution, and low contrast.  Since these problems result from atmospheric conditions, they cannot be overcome by simply improving imaging hardware.  What is needed is a solution to combat atmospheric distortion.  In Phase I, EM Photonics demonstrated a signal processing technique based on initial research from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  We modified and implemented this core algorithm and showed its ability to enhance imagery collected from the long-range imaging systems at NASA DFRC.  In Phase II, we will evolve and integrate the prototype components developed in Phase I and deliver an image enhancement device capable of running in real time to mitigate the image distortion present in data collected from NASA DFRC's long-range cameras.* [An Electrochemical, Point-of-Care Detector for Reagent-free, In-situ Diagnostics of Pathogens, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6jdu-dp48) - For long-term exploratory space travel, there will be a critical need for in-situ diagnosis and assessment of biological specimens from symptomatic astronauts, especially, disease pathogens (virus, bacterium, or fungus) and microbial contaminants. Hence, a real-time, non-culture-based microbial detection, identification and quantification system for on-flight monitoring and evaluation of pathogens from astronauts, or the space environment, is strongly desired. The success of such diagnostic tasks critically depends upon the degree of automation and reliability of such trace level detection. To meet this need, we propose to develop a novel miniaturized, point-of-care (POC) detector for reagent-free, no-culturing, in-situ diagnostics of disease pathogens. The envisioned device will be compact, lightweight, fully integrated and automated (requiring minimum human intervention), and highly cost-effective and power-efficient. In Phase I, we will develop a new type of electrochemical molecules and fabricate solid electrode-based probe for in-vitro demonstration of accurate and effective signal transduction of selective binding of pathogenic cells to the electrode as proof-of-principle. In Phase II, the electrode probe will be optimized to increase specificity, sensitivity, stability, and the response to regular biological samples. Finally, the sensor will be integrated with a compact handheld instrument for data collection, analysis and processing and interfacing with existing NASA space instrumentation for both terrestrial and microgravity environments evaluation.* [NACP Site: Terrestrial Biosphere Model and Aggregated Flux Data in Standard Format](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y2cs-jku8) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides standardized output variables for gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), leaf area index (LAI), ecosystem respiration (Re), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H) from 24 terrestrial biosphere models for 47 eddy covariance flux tower sites in North America. Each model used standardized input data for each flux tower site (i.e., gap-filled, locally observed weather; land use history; and other site specific data) and followed standard model setup and spinup procedures. The files also contain gap-filled observations and total uncertainty estimates. The data set was compiled for the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Synthesis for use in model inter-comparison and assessment of how well the models simulate carbon processes across vegetation types and environmental conditions in North America. There is one compressed (.zip) file with this data set. When expanded, the .zip file contains model output data for one variable at one site. The model output and observations are available at the native half-hourly time step, or in daily, monthly, and annual aggregations, in comma-separated text (.csv) format.* [DIHeDRAL: Downhole Regolith Interrogation with Helium-Assisted Drill and LIBS, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ixa8-x4uc) - Future landed robotic missions to the lunar poles will seek to characterize the properties of subsurface regolith. Current instruments for such in-situ analysis, however, require that geological samples be brought to the surface by a sample acquisition tool and subsequently processed and presented to the analyzer. This model has significant limitations with regard to science yield: evaporation of volatile molecules before reaching the instrument, loss of stratigraphic information, sample bias, and cross-contamination. Furthermore, sophisticated sample acquisition, processing and handling mechanisms required to operate in uncontrolled, dusty environments are expensive and failure-prone.

We therefore propose an alternative: bring the instrument to the sample. Specifically, we propose development of a fiber-coupled laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) system, integrated into a 3m-class drill. LIBS uses a high-energy laser pulse to create a plasma on the surface of the material under test; the atomic emissions are collected by a spectrometer and yield elemental composition and basic molecular information. DIHeDRAL will allow profiling of an entire borehole wall, centimeter by centimeter, 360 degrees, from the top to the bottom. 

The proposed Phase II work will include development of a functional prototype and its integration in a drill string and test to a depth of 1m. The performance of the sensor will be tested in a chamber capable of closely reproducing the conditions of the Lunar surface.* [Dropsonde System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/d4vm-b4vi) - A small, modular dropsonde launcher is being developed for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  Some critical measurement needs can only be satisfied by in-situ measurements.  Key examples of such measurements include detailed atmospheric profiles, point meteorological conditions on the surface, and in-situ measurements for calibration and validation of remote sensing systems.  
	Phase I work saw the design and fabrication of a new type of dropsonde with a novel form factor and the associated launcher.  The system was installed in a representative UAV nose.  System components were successfully tested.
	Phase II will involve finalizing the launcher and dropsonde designs, developing the associated control and data handling system, building and testing the integrated system, and finally conducting test flights on a UAV.  
	The ultimate result of the project will be a dropsonde system that can be fitted to many NASA UAVs, including small UAVs, and enable them to gather in-situ atmospheric profiles and surface measurements using dropsondes.
	The Phase II entry TRL is 5; the expected exit TRL is 8.* [Protein Colloidal Aggregation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vvud-s2w8) - <p>Finding an optimal treatment for any disease is impossible until we fully understand its cause. We believe the central problem in obtaining this understanding is that the most commonly proposed models for amyloid aggregation may be incorrect, and that the process is not fundamentally biological. We plan to investigate the pathways and kinetics of protein aggregation to allow accurate predictive modeling of the process and evaluation of potential inhibitors to prevalent diseases including cataract formation, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and others.<p/><p>The goal of the Protein Colloidal Aggregation project is to understand the underlying cause of several major diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. These diseases all occur when protein molecules undergo a peculiar and irreversible process in which they aggregate to form tiny fibers of a unique material called amyloid, which the body cannot remove. Despite enormous investment in research, the fundamental physiochemical mechanism of these diseases remains poorly understood.  Based on initial studies using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we theorized that the aggregation of proteins in these diseases is driven instead by colloidal interactions, the same forces that govern the behavior of nanoscale particles in the colloidal suspensions we encounter every day, such as paint, milk, and clouds. Our theory is being validated by the evidence. For many years, NASA has been heavily involved in research into the structure of proteins and their assembly into crystals, and in studying the colloidal interactions and aggregation of nanoscale particles. To date, however, NASA's colloid research has involved only nonbiological materials. But now we are bridging these two fields by studying the colloidal aggregation of proteins.</p>* [Modular, Plug and Play, Distributed Avionics, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g7bv-t7h6) - The objective of this SBIR effort  was to prove the viability of an Ethernet version of the  MicroSat Systems, Inc. (MSI) modular, plug and play (PnP) spacecraft avionics architecture. This revolutionary architecture provides a near-term solution to modular, plug and play avionics while distributing power and data management functions on a single circuit allowing rapid interfacing to other satellite avionics such as the GSFC Space Cube.  By integrating the MSI protocol converter technology with the ABET Technologies Digital Current System, MSI can provide a network with standardized attachment nodes that carries data and power on an Intelligent Power/Data Ring (IPDR).The IPDR network, which can host a variety of data protocols, currently implements a high speed SPA-S (SpaceWire) core to support the AFRL PnP efforts. It enables full PnP modularity reducing spacecraft integration and test to a few days.  Since the system is implemented with a common set of nodes for every interface instead of custom cards in a card cage, the hardware costs are dramatically lower as well, only 40-60% of comparable centralized systems. Using commercial Ethernet parts integrated into the existing IPDR node processor and interface boards successful proof of concept testing was performed during Phase I.  The transfer of Ethernet data frames was demonstrated into the IPDR ring via a peripheral Ethernet device, from one IPDR node to another, and finally back out of the ring to the external Ethernet device. Figure 1 shows the setup of the final node-to-node Ethernet communication test. Although this testing verified the fundamental functionality of Ethernet communication on the IPDR ring avionics, there is significant effort remaining to mature this into a flight worthy avionics architecture .  The Phase II will investigate flight parts selection for the nodes, firmware development required to improve bandwidth, and flight qualification and delivery of a Ethernet version of an IPDR node.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Diurnal (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c32b-nwj8) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

  The MERRA-Land product, MSTUNXMLD or tavgU_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional diurnal at the native resolution. All collections from this group are at reduced horizontal resolution. 
  
    The data are on the GEOS-5 native 540 x 361 grid with 2/3&deg; longitude x 1/2&deg; latitude resolution. Data are archived in the HDF-EOS (Grid) format, based on HDF4.* [NACP Regional: National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Aggregated Gridded Model Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kasf-cwbw) - This data set provides two products that were derived from the recently published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis 1-degree terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs (Gridded 1-deg Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et al., 2013). The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional Synthesis - Description of Observations and Models.* [NACP Regional: Original Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8cxg-662q) - ABSTRACT: This data set contains the originally-submitted observation measurement data, terrestrial biosphere model output data, and inverse model simulations that various investigator teams contributed to the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis activities. The data set provides nine (9) data packages of remote sensing and ground observation measurements (OM) (MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP), MODIS net primary production (NPP), MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPar), MODIS leaf area index (LAI), MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), MODIS normalize difference vegetation index (NDVI), Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) forest biomass, National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) crop NPP, and Flux Anomaly). The data set also provides data packages of simulation results from 19 terrestrial biosphere models (TBM) and eight (8) inverse models (IM). The data packages are respectively OM, TBM, and IM data files listed in Tables 4-6. Each OM, TBM, and IM data package contains all of the original data (and documentation, if any) that the NACP Modeling and Synthesis Thematic Data Center (MAST-DC) acquired or received. These originally-submitted data were processed by the MAST-DC to produce the three standardized gridded data sets of carbon flux for inter-comparison purposes (see Related Data Products below). These original data and documentation are provided to allow users of the standardized gridded data products to be able to trace back to the data origins when needed. The Data Center (ORNL DAAC) transformed some of the originally-submitted data files to file formats that are more suitable for long-term archiving. For example, *.xlsx files were saved as *.csv, ERDAS Imagine files were converted to GeoTIFFs, and MATLAB files were converted to GeoTIFF and NetCDF formats as appropriate. Files received in NetCDF, GeoTIFF, and HDF formats were not transformed.* [Three-Dimensional Cockpit Display System for Improved Situational Awareness, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bhti-r47g) - Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a 3D cockpit display (3D-COD) system for improved pilot situational awareness and safety in 3D airspace by overcoming the inherent limitations of 2D information presentation.  The proposed display will be automultiscopic and will be based on a projector, a stationary holographic optical element screen integrated with a high-speed electro-optical scanner and high-speed electronics with a software interface to NASA systems.  This minimum 8-in. diagonal drop-down head-up display with no moving parts will present six or more perspective views to air crew members, forming integrated virtual volumetric 3D images viewable over a 60 degree horizontal field of view.  In Phase I POC designed a laboratory prototype and successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed system by assembling a single-user monochrome 3D-COD prototype.  In Phase II POC will further develop the true 3D display technology and construct a fully functional system that will project distortion-free, 400-600 lumen, full-color, virtual volumetric 3D images at a 30-60 Hz video rate for real-time user interaction with the images, each from his or her own perspective.* [A Network of Multi-band Sensors for Radar Design, Deployment, and Diagnostics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mbs4-dctp) - Limitations on the design, monitoring and diagnosis of complex microwave systems due to insufficient models, the reality of imperfect physical conditions, and the reliance on trial-and-error iteration for system improvement serve to increase the time and costs of radar development. While microwave characterization is traditionally the realm of conventional, port-based measurements, the proposed concept suggests an alternative: the development of a novel network of electro-optic sensors that probe the near-field amplitude and phase of microwave signals at strategic locations within prototype or field-deployed radar systems. Such a sensor network, which would rely on optically-coupled, non-conductive, ultrawideband probes, would provide an unprecedented combination of negligible invasiveness, freedom from electrical interference, and the ability to capture signal information at frequencies from UHF to W-band. It would impact the development of virtually the entire range of technologies relevant to active microwave earth-science instruments. The proposed program will thus lead to the development of an instrument that can aid in areas such as deployment, calibration, and phase correction in large arrays, as well as in the identification of sources of electromagnetic-interference signals and the isolation of faults and failures.* [Global Cyclone Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f2cj-m2e5) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI) Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation (WASP). Utilizing average monthly precipitation data from 1980 through 2000 at a resolution of 2.5 degrees, WASP assesses the precipitation deficit or surplus over a three month temporal window that is weighted by the magnitude of the seasonal cyclic variation in precipitation. The three months' averages are derived from the precipitation data and the median rainfall for the 21 year period is calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells where the three month running average of precipitation is less than 1 mm per day ae excluded. Drought events are identified when the magnitude of a monthly precipitation deficit is less than or equal to 50 percent of its longterm median value for three or more consecutive months. Grid cells are then divided into 10 classes having an approximately equal number of grid cells. Higher grid cell values denote higher frequencies of drought occurrences. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Electrical Impedance Tomography Technology](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vpps-9q2h) - <p>The goal for the&nbsp;Electrical Impedance Tomography Technology (EITT) project is to develop a reliable portable, lightweight device providing two-dimensional tomographic imaging of the human body using impedance mapping.

Validation of such predictions is an important but difficult proposition and a lack of appropriate evaluation methods renders prognostics meaningless. Evaluation methods currently used in the research community are not standardized and in many cases do not sufficiently assess key performance aspects expected out of a prognostics algorithm. In this paper we introduce several new evaluation metrics tailored for prognostics and show that they can effectively evaluate various algorithms as compared to other conventional metrics. Four prognostic algorithms, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Polynomial Regression (PR), are compared. These algorithms vary in complexity and their ability to manage uncertainty around predicted estimates. Results show that the new metrics rank these algorithms in a different manner; depending on the requirements and constraints suitable metrics may be chosen. Beyond these results, this paper offers ideas about how metrics suitable to prognostics may be designed so that the evaluation procedure can be standardized.* [Distributed Rocket Engine Testing Health Monitoring System, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tfxc-qk4s) - Leveraging the Phase I achievements of the Distributed Rocket Engine Testing Health Monitoring System (DiRETHMS) including its software toolsets and system building blocks, the Phase II project seeks a comprehensive prototyping of the technology. Phase II not only expands the functionality and applications of the Phase I achievements, but utilizes evolving diagnostics due to the advanced intelligent algorithms built on AGNC's Optimized Neuro-Genetic Fast Estimator (ONGFE) framework. In this way, the Phase II effort culminates in a product that is able to adapt to unknown operating conditions and learn new failures in an unsupervised way. Additionally, a major effort consists of providing a novel, robust, and embedded software toolset for sensor Failure Detection and Identification (FDI): Sensor Data Validation and Self-Healing Scheme (SDV-SHS). To increase the commercialization potential and market values of the NASA and non-NASA applications, the Phase II project adapts DiRETHMS to the market requirements. The work in Phase II along with a modular architecture and standardization ensures a solid integration with NASA's Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) for enhanced health monitoring.* [Application of Advanced Electromagnetic Arrays to High Efficiency, High Bandwidth, Redundant Linear Actuators, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/iv52-hair) - There is a need to develop electromechanical actuators to improve
performance beyond that of hydraulic devices currently being used in
numerous aerospace and industrial applications. Beginning with NASA-provided performance specifications, this Phase I SBIR effort has employed a systems approach to develop and optimize the design of an electromechanical linear actuator appropriate for demanding launch vehicle thrust vector and control surface applications. The actuator system design consists of a high-efficiency permanent magnet motor with redundant current channels for system fault tolerance, multiple high-bandwidth controllers that are matched to motor characteristics, and a compact roller-screw mechanism, along with housing and supporting elements. A system of innovations was necessary to overcome the inherent limitations of today's electromechanical actuators, which were developed based on the limitations of traditional motors, power electronics, and available actuator hardware. The projected weight of the actuator prototype to be built in Phase II is less than the existing hydraulic systems currently in use by NASA, and half of previous electric prototypes having the same performance specification. Working with a major aerospace company partner, the Phase II Team will deliver a tested prototype actuator system as a basis for future advanced commercial products.* [Integrated Endurance and Resistance Exercise Countermeasures Using a Gravity Independent Training Device](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cjtz-ke26) - This study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of a new exercise device, multi-mode exercise device or M-MED, for use during long-duration space flights for the maintenance of cardiovascular and musculoskeletal fitness of astronauts. The M-MED is gravity independent and provides both the high force resistance and low force rowing type resistance. To date the results indicate that foot forces in resistance mode exercise on M-MED are similar to those seen using free weight exercises.     
Electromyography (EMG) studies demonstrate that similar activation levels are seem in key muscles during either M-MED based or free weight resistance exercise. EMG during rowing demonstrate that the thigh, leg, and arm muscles are robustly activated. Endurance mode exercise was also found to stimulate recruitment of the muscles which support the spine. In a recently completed study, 32 subjects (16 male, 16 female) completed 5 weeks of combined resistance and endurance training using the M-MED. Muscle strength increased ~20% while aerobic fitness measured as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) increased ~8%. M-MED training increased time to hand grip fatigue by ~70% and leg extension fatigue by ~27%. Thigh muscle cross sectional area increased ~11% as a result of training. Additional deliverables include cross validation of VO2max testing results between the M-MED device and laboratory standard cycle ergometry based testing protocols. As requested by NASA, additional studies have demonstrated that M-MED based exercise can increase the size and strength of the calf and hamstrings muscle groups. These results demonstrate that the M-MED device can be used for both training and physical work capacity testing providing a platform for in-flight assessment.     
In summary, findings to date indicate that the gravity independent M-MED is a viable option for resistance- and endurance-mode exercise during flight and/or planetary exploration thereby addressing two critical risks: 1) Cardiovascular deconditioning; 2) Decreased muscle strength, endurance, and size (atrophy). Endurance mode exercise may have the added benefit of maintaining and, possibly, improving endurance of arm muscles of flight crews as well as aiding in the maintenance of lower back stability and loading during flight and planetary exploration.

Unfortunately, they are limited in terms of their heat flux capability, approximately 5W/cm2.  Incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2.  This is a severe limitation for axial groove (CCHP) as well as loop heat pipes (LHP).  Standard CCHPs are also not suitable for Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, since they can only operate with a very small adverse elevation, on the order of 0.10 inch.  Landers can have tilts of ±20<SUP>o</SUP>, while rovers can have tilts of ±45<SUP>o</SUP>.  As a result, a wick with a higher heat flux capability and pumping capability is required.  This program will develop heat pipes with both 1) Sintered wicks, and 2) Hybrid grooved and sintered wicks.  Heat pipes with both wick designs will be capable of operating at heat fluxes in the ten's of watts per cm2, and in Lunar or Martian environments at large slopes against gravity.  An all-sintered wick will be used when the entire heat pipe must be able to operate against gravity, while a hybrid wick will be used when the condensers will always be gravity aided on the planetary surface.* [High Rate Tellecommunications for Mars Planetary and Proximity Ranges and other Deep-Space Missions-A, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2kcq-75gq) - Space vehicles for deep space exploration rely on microwave and millimeter wave links for communication with earth stations. As the mission of space probes expands, the data rate to be transmitted increases, and effective, compact, methods of modulating the RF carrier with high-speed data become a critical necessity.  Passive MMIC modulation approaches introduce loss into the RF path and analog phase shifters in particular can exhibit significant shortcomings such as insertion loss variations and phase-shift range limitations. For more complex digital or hybrid modulation schemes, passive modulator components may also need elaborate calibration look-up tables to achieve desired phase and amplitude modulation accuracy with respect to process and temperature variations. Hittite has recently developed high-performance, active I/Q vector modulator MMICs for communication systems operating up to C-band, based on SiGe and GaAs HBT process technologies. As part of this program, we propose to apply similar circuit techniques together with more advanced device technologies to develop high-performance active vector modulators for both X- and Ka-band frequencies.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Final Orbit Product (daily files, generated weekly) from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/aeez-xv4i) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Final Orbit Product (daily files, generated weekly) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS final combined orbit products. The final products are considered the most consistent and highest quality IGS solutions; they consist of daily orbit files, generated on a weekly basis with a delay up to 13 (for the last day of the week) to 20 (for the first day of the week) days. All orbit solution files utilize the extended standard product-3 (SP3c) format and span 24 hours from 00:00 to 23:45 UTC.* [Improved Forecasting of Solar Particle Events and their Effects on Space Electronics, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a3yx-miyc) - High-energy space radiation from Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events (SPEs) pose significant risks to equipment and astronaut health in NASA missions. Energetic particles from SPEs associated with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may adversely affect not only beyond-Low-Earth-Orbit missions, but also aircraft avionics, communications, and airline crew/passenger health. It is crucial to develop a capability to forecast SPEs and their effects on systems to guide planning of mission-related tasks and risk mitigation strategies.
CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC), University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), and Vanderbilt University (VU) propose to develop a comprehensive forecasting capability - SPE Forecast (SPE4) - comprising state-of-the-art modules integrated within a novel computational framework. SPE4 will include: (a) the MAG4 code for probability forecasts of flares/CMEs, and SPEs, (b) the PATH code for solar particle transport through the heliosphere, (c) Geant4-based transport calculations including geomagnetic modulation and atmospheric interactions (for avionics) to yield spectra of SPE-induced energetic protons/heavy ions, interfaced to (d) the CR?ME96 code for calculation of resulting effects in electronics. 
In Phase I, we demonstrated the superior capability of MAG4, PATH, and Geant4 for their respective tasks using a prior solar event case. A controller script was developed for automated code execution and data transfer across interfaces. Functionality of the overall event-to-effects capability was demonstrated using the 28-Sep-2012 event. We developed a concept of the final software product for NASA based on client-server architecture. In Phase II, we will collaborate with VU to interface calculated particle spectra with CR?ME96 to determine single-event effects in electronics. We will enhance robustness, accuracy, and execution speed via improved models and procedures, and demonstrate the software for persistent 24x7 SPE monitoring.* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/85yv-vq83) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard 

total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and 

volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. 

(2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined 

using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational 

GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per 

grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional 

economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the 

range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is 

generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia 

University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and 

Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Advanced Propeller Flow Control for Increased Propulsive Efficiency, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9ty6-qh4z) - An important mission for NASA is the development of revolutionary flight concepts and technology.  The development of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), the resurgence of general aviation, and growing interest in environmentally conscious, all-electric, emissionless aircraft have brought about a renewed interest in propeller design.  Overall, since the propeller's golden age during the WWII era, very little has changed in propeller design.  Computers have automated the design processes, but the basic design methodology, from an aerodynamic point of view has changed very little.  Strides have been made in acoustics and multidisciplinary optimization (MDO), but the basic aerodynamic design and performance of the subsonic propeller has basically remained unchanged.  The explosion of UAVs and a need for more efficient designs allowing greater payload, range, and loiter times have taken UAVs from simple cut-and-try designs to sophisticated, aerodynamically efficient systems.  An area as of yet not fully exploited by this class of aircraft, is that of propeller efficiency.  Most smaller UAVs and micro-UAVs simply use off-the-shelf radio control propellers, while moderate size UAVs rely on propellers designed using classical blade element theory or those derived for general aviation aircraft.  While these propellers provide industry acceptable levels of thrust for a given torque, the majority of propellers suffer some form of flow separation.  The extent of flow separation can range from small areas in cruise regions of the flight envelope, to large areas during climb and wind milling.  Significant propeller performance gains in the form of increased thrust and reduced torque can be obtained by eliminating these separated regions across the flight envelope.  A simple, efficient, and robust flow control technique is proposed to eliminate these separated regions and provide a marked increase in propeller performance and vehicle propulsive performance.* [Broadband Phase Shifter for High Contrast Nulling Interferometry](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g2zw-psnk) - <p>All approaches to starlight suppression are subject to spectral bandpass limitations. For nulling interferometers (&ldquo;nullers&rdquo;), the issue lies in achieving broadband symmetry between destructively interfering beams. In this effort we propose to improve upon the use of Fresnel rhombs as achromatic phase shifters (APS) for broadband high contrast nulling interferometry by adding dielectric coatings to each rhomb. These components will be characterized along with a fiber bundle spatial filter array (SFA) that is used for complex wavefront control.&nbsp; These components (the APS and SFA) are used in parallel to ultimately reach contrasts needed for Earth-like exoplanet detection.</p><p>The objectives of this project include 1) designing and tolerancing a new set of coated Fresnel rhomb APS that will, in theory, improve broadband peformance by over two orders of magnitude compared to a previous generation set of APS, 2) procuring one or more symmetric sets of APS and fabricating new mounting hardware, and 3) measuring and verifying the performance of the APS. The end goal or product is to produce an enhanced set of optics that improve the performance of the current, uncoated APS rhombs by two to three orders of magnitude, for use in testing with future demonstrations of the Segmented Aperture Interferometric Nulling Testbed (SAINT), which uses the Visible Nulling Coronagraph (VNC) for high-contrast source suppression. This is a technology maturation effort for missions such as the Habitable Exoplanet Imager (HabEx) or a future large aperture UV/Optical/IR telescope (LUVOIR) Surveyor.&nbsp; The innovative elements include a fabrication scheme that yields symmetric optics, and a test regiment that can measure prism angles with sub-arcsecond precision and retardance to micro-radian precision.</p>* [Highly Durable Catalysts for Ignition of Advanced Monopropellants, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/waen-wphd) - Monopropellants are readily ignited or decomposed over a bed of solid catalyst. A serious limitation of existing catalysts in the ignition of advanced monopropellants is limited thermal stability.* [A Propellant Mass Gauge, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/acnk-n58v) - Advanced Technologies Group, Inc. proposes the development of a Liquid-Oxygen Mass Gauge, (LMG) for In-Space cryogenic storage capable of continuous monitoring  of liquid quantities to better than 1% accuracy. The proposed sensor builds on previous liquid hydrogen sensor development successes and patents.  It can be utilized to measure cryogenic propellants, and sub-critical cryogenic fluids in use on a wide range of space applications and in ground applications to monitor fluids ranging from liquid oxygen to MMH and N2O4.  The LMG can also indicate the presence of contaminants such as nitrogen used to purge the system. The current methods use either wire resistance measurements, capacitance or point sensors, combined with pressure and temperature measurements.  The LMG will be lighter, require less energy to operate, and provide less heat leak than existing technologies. Current techniques will not function correctly in boiling or stratified liquid cryogens or in reduced gravity. During phase I, Proof-of Concept experiments will be performed with liquid oxygen. Commercial applications in the home health care industry have been identified.* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 Total Column Ozone Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nwi9-mstf) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 Total Column Ozone Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

The ability to detect and quickly locate and mitigate a pressure vessel breach is critical to the safety of any long duration spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or a proposed lunar base or mission to Mars.  Current NASA protocol for finding a spacecraft leak uses a handheld ultrasonic directional microphone, similar to those widely deployed industrially, to detect the 40 kHz airborne ultrasonic hiss generated by the downstream leak turbulence.  However, known limitations exist regarding the use of airborne ultrasonic emissions for locating leaks in the spacecraft environment because the downstream side of the leak occurs into the vacuum of space, creating reduced leak noise inside the pressure vessel.  Blockages of the transmission of airborne ultrasonic energy by structural components, avionics, and equipment racks also limit the detection range of such systems.  An alternative approach that we propose is to monitor the spacecraft structure itself---the pressure vessel skin---for leak-generated surface-borne ultrasound by means of a flexible and modular electronics package with fully integrated surface sensor arrays, data acquisition electronics, and radio frequency communication capabilities.* [NACP Site: Terrestrial Biosphere Model and Aggregated Flux Data in Standard Format](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pu3p-kkgt) - This data set provides standardized output variables for gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), leaf area index (LAI), ecosystem respiration (Re), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H) from 24 terrestrial biosphere models for 47 eddy covariance flux tower sites in North America.

TRMM was successfully launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.

The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a nine-channel passive microwave radiometer, which builds on the heritage of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument flown aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. Microwave radiation is emitted by the Earth&apos;s surface and by water droplets within clouds. However, when layers of large ice particles are present in upper cloud regions - a condition highly correlated with heavy rainfall - microwave radiation tends to scatter at frequencies above 19 GHz. The TMI detects radiation at five frequencies chosen to discriminate among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood of rainfall. The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by this method is the deduction of cloud precipitation consistent with the radiation measurement at each frequency. The TMI frequencies are 10.65, 19.35, 37 and 85.5 GHz (dual polarization), and 21 GHz (vertical polarization only).

The Level 1A product file (1A11) is a concatenation of the Level 0 data with a header record and, as such, is reversible to Level 0. The header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbit number, times of the first scan and number of scans, among other things. The Level 0 data contain the actual channel data expressed as &quot;sensor counts.&quot; A file contains data for a single orbit with a file size of about 7 MB (uncompressed).  There are 16 files of TMI 1A11 data produced per day.

Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.

Some of the most exciting technologies that require nanometer scale features include disk drives and memory storage devices, light-emitting diodes, solar energy devices, and microarrays for genomics, proteomics, and tissue engineering applications. Along with new advances in this field comes the challenge to enable the reliable, low-cost manufacture of these technologies in order to bring this fascinating science to the general public. Currently, nanopatterning is often carried out using various lithography techniques. Despite their successes in many applications, one of the challenges facing such lithographic methods is their inability to generate patterns smaller than 20nm in a way that is reliable, cost-effective and rapid enough for industrial-scale manufacturing processes. Understanding how to overcome these engineering hurdles is the reason for my interest in self-assembly as a chemical engineering graduate student. In short, I am interested in developing strategies to induce nanometer scale particles to arrange themselves into specific patterns required for the aforementioned technological applications.

There are plenty of examples that illustrate the possibilities of self-assembly, both in nature (DNA, protein folding, etc.) and through artificial means. However, it is also widely appreciated that self-assembly processes involving nanoparticles are limited in terms of the number of large-scale, low-defect structures that they can produce under various thermodynamics conditions. If the true potential of nanotechnology is to be reached, we must uncover ways to reach any desired structure. This is where "directed" self-assembly can be useful. It is possible, for example, to use traditional lithographic techniques to create a pattern on a significantly coarser lengthscale than the desired structure that helps to direct the self-assembly of particles on a finer scale (pattern multiplication). My research proposal will seek to elucidate the possibilities and limitations of this method of directed self-assembly. Specifically, the goal of this project will be to create computational tools that help discover new directed self-assembly strategies for scalable nanomanufacturing.

The aim of this project is to use computational tools taken from inverse statistical mechanics to allow for a "bottom up" design of nanomaterials. Traditionally, the forward method of equilibrium statistical mechanics predicts bulk properties given knowledge about particle interactions. Conversely, the inverse methods allow an investigator to determine the particle interactions that yield desired material properties. Whit this theoretical framework, it is possible to design a material's macroscopic behavior by taking advantage of the ability to tune nanoparticle interactions (design from the bottom up).

For this proposal, the focus will be on the design of materials through the use of two-dimensional patterning of nanoparticles on a substrate. With a pre-patterned substrate, it is possible to influence nanoparticles assemble into various structures. I intend to investigate the minimum amount of existing scaffolding required to allow nanoparticles to build the desired defect-free pattern (i.e., how much direction is required for directed self-assembly). In the end, I hope to create a design strategy for the creation the coarse length scale designs that can direct self-assembly of more detailed nanoscale patterns.* [Onboard Detection of Snow, Ice, Clouds, and Other Processes](https://data.nasa.gov/d/42ue-eijd) - The detection of clouds within a satellite image is essential for retrieving surface geophysical parameters from optical and thermal imagery. Even a small percentage of cloud cover within a radiometer pixel can adversely affect the determination of surface variables such as albedo and temperature. Thus, onboard processing of satellite data requires reliable automated cloud detection algorithms that are applicable to a wide range of surface types. Unfortunately cloud-detection, particularly over snow- and ice-covered surfaces, is a problem that plagues the field of remote sensing because of the lack of spectral contrast.
This paper discusses preliminary results based on kernel methods for unsupervised discovery of snow, ice, clouds, and other geophysical processes based on data from the MODIS instrument and discusses implementation in computationally constrained environments such as those found on satellites.* [A Novel Low-Cost Dual-Wavelength Precipitation Radar Sensor Network, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ktw8-sezx) - NASA is committed to measuring precipitation on a global scale. In 1997,
NASA launched the Tropical Rain Measuring Mission which carried the
first spaceborne precipitation radar (PR). Operating at 13.8 GHz, the PR
demonstrated the potential of spaceborne radars to map global
precipitation. To improve rainfall estimates, the next generation system
being proposed for the NASA Global Precipitation Mission is a
dual-wavelength (Ku/Ka-band) precipitation radar (DPR). Operating at Ku
and Ka-band, it will yield additional information on the drop size
distribution (DSD). Advanced ground-based Ku/Ka-band DPR systems are
needed to develop and validate the retrieval algorithms that will be
used by GPM. This proposed Phase I effort will investigate the required
innovations to design and construct a novel, low-cost, scanning,
dual-polarized DPR senor and sensor network. The focus will be on
developing a low-cost ruggedized compact antenna, transceiver, power
amplifier and real-time processing and communication subsystems. This
advanced DPR sensor network will provide unprecedented spatial/temporal
sampling and coverage and multiple methods to determine DSD:
polarization, differential extinction, multi-look radar measurements of
extinction. As a sensor network, limitations due to earth curvature,
topography and ground clutter that affect the existing weather radar
infrastructure can be overcome.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Time Average 1-hourly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4wx4-b5xj) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present.

Recent results have demonstrated the efficacy of nano-particle scandium oxide, but a detailed theory on mechanism has been lacking.  Our theory explains published data and point to an optimized cathode which we here propose to build and test at our facility.  The cathode is the performance limiting component in high frequency linear beam amplifiers such as traveling wave tubes and klystrons.  Bandwidth, data rates, numbers of channels, frequency and output power requirements are going up.  The performance of linear beam amplifiers is acutely limited by the cathode limitations.  Scandate cathodes offer a way to increase emission from current limits of about 10 A/cm2 to about 50 A/cm2.* [Digital Conically Scanned L-Band Radar, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/whqs-crjq) - The proposed effort seeks to develop a digitally steered polarimetric phased array L-Band radar utilizing a novel, high performance architecture leveraging recent advances in radio frequency and digital signal processing components.

The sensors developed here are based on the GaN/AlGaN materials system and are sensitive in the wavelength range from 250-400nm. Target responsivities are > 0.1 A/W throughout the spectral interest range. The first arrays produced under phase 1 were sensitive both to 285 and 315 nm simultaneously. Multicolor sensitivity improves background noise rejection and provides much more detailed analysis of atmospheric aerosol scattering. Noise is dominated by diode reverse leakage and is less than 10-9A/cm2. The CE manufacturing process is enabled by the recognition that surfaces on which radiation sensitive materials are grown cannot be exposed to plasma etch effluents. To overcome this limitation, a dielectric lift-off-lithography process was developed. In this process, the growth surfaces only come in contact with organic solvents and photosensitive plastics during manufacture. Initial results were obtained on a 10 x 10 diode array. In subsequent work, we intend to produce 100 x 100 arrays. In addition, it the range of attainable spectral sensitivities will be mapped out by studying the range of achievable AlGaN stoichiometries that are practically attainable.* [Passive Radiation Shielding: Integrating Multilayer and Multipurpose Materials into Space Habitat Design](https://data.nasa.gov/d/h4ph-uauf) - The prospect of long-term human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit poses a unique set of challenges for space habitat designers. One of those challenges is protecting astronauts from the ionizing radiation in space. On Earth, people are largely protected from that radiation by the atmosphere and the magnetic field. But beyond the natural protection mechanisms of the Earth, the space radiation environment can be dangerous for astronauts. It puts them at risk of several severe health problems, including cancer, central nervous system damage, and cataracts.

Although there are several sources of ionizing radiation in space, one of the greatest causes for concern are galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). GCRs are isotropic and low in flux. They are a source of chronic radiation exposure, putting astronaut health at risk gradually over time. GCRs are mostly composed of protons and helium nuclei, but the largest concern for human health comes from their minority heavy ion component. The heavy ions in GCRs can potentially penetrate shielding and human tissue. In the interest of enabling a long-term lunar or Martian mission, the radiation protection systems should be improved to better protect against GCRs.

One radiation protection method is passive shielding. A passive radiation shield is a material that is placed between a radiation source and a radiosensitive target, designed to absorb the radiation before it reaches the target. A simple example is a patient wearing a lead apron over his or her vital organs, while being exposed to X-rays at a hospital. In space, passive radiation shielding is more complicated than it sounds, because the variations in particle composition and energy spectra make it difficult to develop a catchall shield. For long-term, human-rated missions, the best material choices for passive radiation shielding tend to be multipurpose, hydrogen-rich, and have a small atomic mass.

The purpose of this research is to investigate innovative passive shielding methodologies that are integrated into the design of space habitats. Specifically, this research will evaluate the feasibility of using multilayer materials, water walls, and varied habitat configurations in order to help keep astronaut radiation exposure as low as reasonably achievable. The goal is to improve the shielding efficacy against GCRs, while reducing the amount of parasitic mass required to protect the astronauts. NASA's On-Line Tool for the Assessment of Radiation in Space (OLTARIS) will be used to perform the analyses. This research directly serves to advance the fidelity of topic 6.5.3.2 in the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap, and ultimately, it aims to advance our ability to explore our solar system.* [PHOBOS 2 MARS TERMOSKAN EDITED THERMAL/VIS IMAGING EDR V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/et5i-mqgb) - In February and March, 1989, the Termoskan instrument on board the Phobos '88 spacecraft of the USSR acquired a limited set of very high resolution simultaneous observations of the reflected solar flux (hereafter referred to as the visible channel) and emitted thermal flux (thermal infrared (IR)) from Mars's equatorial region. These are, so far, the highest spatial resolution thermal data ever obtained for Mars. Four slightly overlapping thermal panoramas (also called scans or swaths) cover a large portion of the equatorial region from 30S to 6N latitude. Simultaneous visible panoramas were taken during each of the four observing sessions; due to spacecraft memory limitations, visible channel processing was stopped early relative to the thermal channel for 2 of the sessions (2 and 4). Thus, the visible channel panoramas are shorter than the thermal panoramas for these sessions. These data are saved for historical reasons; they are not considered to be of archival quality.* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV-B Erythemal Local Noon Irradiance Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/79cb-f3ut) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV-B Erythemal Local Noon Irradiance Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

This will allow the creation of high-speed 20 x 20 mm CZT detectors with 256 to 512 pixels (1 mm or less pitch). Starting with prior proven designs, we will introduce an innovative, patent-pending readout scheme that reduces digitization to only one signal per channel.  We will also replace polling methods with sparse access and an innovative technique that can keep most of the pixels operating while reading out data. These innovations may increase the ASIC event detection rate by orders of magnitude while reducing system power and processing requirements.  These innovations are essential for upgrading current gamma detection technology for future missions. There exists no ASICs today that can come close to achieving this performance.* [Adaptive Flight Envelope Estimation and Protection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u6tq-cden) - Impact Technologies, in collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative flight envelope estimation and protection system for aircraft under damage upset conditions or severe flight variations.  Through the integration of advanced fault detection (IVHM) algorithms, real-time system identification of the damage/faulted aircraft and flight envelop mapping, real-time decision support can be executed autonomously for improving damage tolerance and flight recoverability.  The core tasks to complete of this proposed workscope include: 1) Development of a strong-tracking health identification algorithm for assessing the dynamics and performance limitation of impaired aircraft; 2) Development of the adaptive flight envelope estimation process; 3) Development of the envelope protection algorithm based on adaptive neural networks that can learn the generated online dynamic models; and 4) Demonstration of the proposed technologies under realistic flight control actuator and propulsion fault conditions. A core innovation of this program is the use of the on-line, adaptive learning neural networks that are capable of generating the dynamic models and operational envelop in real-time, which can then be used to estimate limits on the controller commands while preventing envelope exceedances.  The developed techniques will be demonstrated in Phase I using an integrated aircraft model that uses the NASA MAPSS propulsion model and Generic Transport Model (GTM), with eventual demonstration using the NASA Flight Simulator at NASA Langley.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Ultra-Rapid Orbit/Clock/ERP Product Comparison Summary from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7aes-si8s) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Rapid Orbit/Reference Frame Product Summary from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

MONITORING USING GAUSSIAN PROCESS

VARUN CHANDOLA* AND RANGA RAJU VATSAVAI*

Abstract. Biomass monitoring, specifically, detecting changes in the biomass or vegetation of
a geographical region, is vital for studying the carbon cycle of the system and has significant
implications in the context of understanding climate change and its impacts. Recently, several time
series change detection methods have been proposed to identify land cover changes in temporal
profiles (time series) of vegetation collected using remote sensing instruments. In this paper, we
adapt Gaussian process regression to detect changes in such time series in an online fashion. While
Gaussian process (GP) has been widely used as a kernel based learning method for regression and
classification, their applicability to massive spatio-temporal data sets, such as remote sensing data,
has been limited owing to the high computational costs involved. In our previous work we proposed
an efficient Toeplitz matrix based solution for scalable GP parameter estimation. In this paper we
apply these solutions to a GP based change detection algorithm. The proposed change detection
algorithm requires a memory footprint which is linear in the length of the input time series and
runs in time which is quadratic to the length of the input time series. Experimental results show
that both serial and parallel implementations of our proposed method achieve significant speedups
over the serial implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed change
detection method in identifying changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data.* [Privacy Preserving Outlier Detection through Random Nonlinear Data Distortion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hdqp-dua8) - Consider a scenario in which the data owner has some private/sensitive data and wants a data miner to access it for studying important patterns without revealing the sensitive information. Privacy preserving data mining aims to solve this problem by randomly transforming the data prior to its release to data miners. Previous work only considered the case of linear data perturbations — additive, multiplicative or a combination of both for studying the usefulness of the perturbed output. In
this paper, we discuss nonlinear data distortion using potentially nonlinear random data transformation and show how it can be
useful for privacy preserving anomaly detection from sensitive datasets. We develop bounds on the expected accuracy of the
nonlinear distortion and also quantify privacy by using standard definitions. The highlight of this approach is to allow a user
to control the amount of privacy by varying the degree of nonlinearity. We show how our general transformation can be used for anomaly detection in practice for two specific problem instances: a linear model and a popular nonlinear model using the sigmoid function. We also analyze the proposed nonlinear transformation in full generality and then show that for specific
cases it is distance preserving. A main contribution of this paper is the discussion between the invertibility of a transformation
and privacy preservation and the application of these techniques to outlier detection. Experiments conducted on real-life datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.* [Towards a Framework for Evaluating and Comparing Diagnosis Algorithms](https://data.nasa.gov/d/27y3-jxaq) - Diagnostic inference involves the detection of anomalous system behavior and the identification of its cause, possibly down to a failed unit or to a parameter of a failed unit. Traditional approaches to solving this problem include expert/rule-based, model-based, and data-driven methods. Each approach (and various techniques within each approach) use different representations of the knowledge required to perform the diagnosis. The sensor data is expected to be combined with these internal representations to produce the diagnosis result. In spite of the availability of various diagnosis technologies, there have been only minimal efforts to develop a standardized software framework to run, evaluate, and compare different diagnosis technologies on the same system. This paper presents a framework that defines a standardized representation of the system knowledge, the sensor data, and the form of the diagnosis results – and provides a run-time architecture that can execute diagnosis algorithms, send sensor data to the algorithms at appropriate time steps from a variety of sources (including the actual physical system), and collect resulting diagnoses. We also define a set of metrics that can be used to evaluate and compare the performance of the algorithms, and provide software to calculate the metrics.* [Experimental Validation of a Prognostic Health Management System for Electro-Mechanical Actuators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tddm-8y6c) - The work described herein is aimed to advance prognostic health management solutions for electro-mechanical actuators and, thus, increase their reliability and attractiveness to designers of the next generation aircraft and spacecraft. In pursuit of this goal the team adopted a systematic approach by starting with EMA FMECA reviews, consultations with EMA manufacturers, and extensive literature reviews of previous efforts. Based on the acquired knowledge, nominal/off-nominal physics models and prognostic health management algorithms were developed. In order to aid with development of the algorithms and validate them on realistic data, a testbed capable of supporting experiments in both laboratory and flight environment was developed. Test actuators with architectures similar to potential flight-certified units were obtained for the purposes of testing and realistic fault injection methods were designed. Several hundred fault scenarios were created, using permutations of position and load profiles, as well as fault severity levels. The diagnostic system was tested extensively on these scenarios, with the test results demonstrating high accuracy and low numbers of false positive and false negative diagnoses. The prognostic system was utilized to track fault progression in some of the fault scenarios, predicting the remaining useful life of the actuator. A series of run-to-failure experiments were conducted to validate its performance, with the resulting error in predicting time to failure generally lesser than 10% error. While a more robust validation procedure would require dozens more experiments executed under the same conditions (and, consequently, more test articles destroyed), the current results already demonstrate the potential for predicting fault progression in this type of devices. More prognostic experiments are planned for the next phase of this work, including investigation and comparison of other prognostic algorithms (such as various types of Particle Filter and GPR), addition of new fault types, and execution of prognostic experiments in flight environment.* [Precision Membrane Optical Shell (PMOS) Technology for RF/Microwave to Lightweight LIDAR Apertures, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/h8ud-94p8) - Membrane Optical Shell Technology (MOST) is an innovative combination of 1) very low areal density (40 to 200g/m2) optically smooth (<20 nm rms), metallic coated reflective membrane thin films, 2) advanced fabrication techniques that transform the films into self supporting shells through the introduction of permanent optically relevant double curvature, and 3) discrete active boundary control to enable rigid body alignment and maintainment of surface figure in face of environmental disturbances.  Areal densities of better than 2 kg/m2 (including actuators) are projected.  Current measured surface figure is  &#8776;1 to 10 microns rms at up to the 15 cm size, and we are poised for further improvements.  Demonstrated material and fabrication techniques are scaleable to at least the 2m+ diameter single surface apertures and larger apertures are possible through segmentation techniques.  Proven stowage and deployment techniques enable space flight application.  We propose advancing 1) the basic fabrication technology and 2) the TRL level of MOST apertures for ground and space based apertures.  The key resulting innovation is implementation of low areal density, compact roll stowable approaches to realize low mass, low cost reflective apertures for RF/Microwave to LIDAR.  Other NASA and DOD applications are expected as precision and aperture size increase.* [Prognostics Enhanced Reconfigurable Control of Electro-Mechanical Actuators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ivck-kxtd) - Actuator systems are employed widely in aerospace, transportation and industrial processes to provide power to critical loads, such as aircraft control surfaces. They must operate reliably and accurately in order for the vehicle / process to complete successfully its designated mission. Incipient actuator failure conditions may severely endanger the operational integrity of the vehicle / process and compromise its mission. The ability to maintain a stable and credible operation, even in the presence of incipient failures, is of paramount importance to accomplish “must achieve” mission objectives. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the fault-tolerant design of critical subsystems, such as an ElectroMechanical Actuator (EMA), that takes advantage of on-line, real-time estimates of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) or Time-to-Failure (TTF) of a failing component and reconfigures the available control authority by trading off system performance with control activity. The primary goal is to complete critical mission objectives within a time window dictated by prognostic algorithms so that the fault mode is accommodated and an acceptable level of performance maintained for the duration of the mission. The proposed fault-tolerant control design is mathematically rigorous, generic and applicable to a variety of application domains. An EMA is used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.* [LBA-ECO LC-18 Hyperion 30-m Surface Reflectance, Mato Grosso, Brazil: July 2004](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wz9h-5qhw) - This image was collected by the Hyperion sensor on 10-July-2004 at 13:16:16 GMT.  It was calibrated to apparent surface reflectance using the ACORN atmospheric model.The Hyperion imager has a spectral range of 400-2500 nm, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, spatial resolution of 30 m, and a swath width of 7.8 km. Sampling is scene based (256 samples, 512 lines) (http://eo1.usgs.gov/sensors.php).  Through these large number of spectral bands, complex land ecosystems can be imaged and accurately classified.Data from the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer may greatly increase our ability to estimate the presence and structural attributes of selective logging in the Amazon Basin using four biogeophysical indicators not yet derived simultaneously from any satellite sensor: 1) green canopy leaf area index; 2) degree of shadowing; 3) presence of exposed soil and; 4) non-photosynthetic vegetation material. Airborne, field and modeling studies have shown that the optical reflectance continuum (400-2500 nm) contains sufficient information to derive estimates of each of these indicators. Our ongoing studies in the eastern Amazon basin also suggest that these four indicators are sensitive to logging intensity. Satellite-based estimates of these indicators should provide a means to quantify both the presence and degree of structural disturbance caused by various logging regimes.* [Live-Axis Turning for the Fabrication of Non-Rotationally Symmetric Optics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9gz5-nq8u) - The goal of this proposal is to develop a new method to create Non-Rotationally Symmetric (NRS) surfaces that overcomes the limitations of the current techniques and is fast, accurate and inexpensive.  Diamond turning (DT) has revolutionized the fabrication of lightweight optical surfaces for defense and science applications such as forward-looking infrared radar and infrared spectrometers.  It has made this impact not only because it can accurately and rapidly fabricate diffractive, refractive and reflective optical surfaces, but because it can create reference features tied to the optical surfaces to guarantee optical alignment.  An emerging trend in optical design is the use of NRS surfaces that reduce complexity, bulk and weight.  To create these surfaces, DT machines have been modified with a low-amplitude Fast Tool Servo, a third axis or a fly-cutter.  The problem with the FTS is its limited range and the other techniques are plagued by thermal drift during long fabrication times.  The proposed Live Axis Turning (LAT) process combines evolving technologies of air bearings, linear motors, high-resolution encoders and high-speed control systems into a moving lightweight toolpost on a conventional DT machine.  The result is a more flexible machine that can increase production and reduce cost for NRS components.* [LBA-ECO LC-39 MODIS Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mrn5-wyn7) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides active fire locations and estimates of annual fire frequencies for South America from 2000-2007. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm. There are 14 data files with this data set: 7 GeoTIFF (.tif) files of fire frequency at MODIS 250 m resolution, where each grid cell value represents the number of days in that year on which active fires were detected, and 7 shape files of active fire locations for the years 2001-2007.* [Development of a Low-SWAP, RAD-Tolerant, Thermally Stable, 10Gbps per Channel Fiber Optic Transceiver for Harsh Environment Networking Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jaum-bq5c) - According to the NASA Topic S3, "the Science Mission Directorate will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our Solar System and beyond.  SMD's future direction will be moving from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns), that would require new vantage points, or that would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets.  The demand for larger area coverage, higher resolution and multi-spectral capability in satellite remote sensing applications, and the demand for higher data rates in digital satellite communications networks continue to place ever increasing demands on onboard data handling and processing subsystems - 1 Gbps to 4 Gbps data rates are not uncommon and continually increasing. Further, satellite subsystems must be capable of reliable operation in the space radiation environment and will continue to be constrained by SWAP limitations. Shrinking development budgets and rapid development requirements are driving onboard data handling networks toward more flexible, non-proprietary architectures and interface standardization. Therefore, SPI proposes to develop a 10Gbps per channel optical transceiver and mating, multi-channel reprogrammable network interface card (NIC) that are RAD-tolerant to over 300KRad-Si TID, operate reliably from -25C to 85C.  Further, the NIC will be fully reprogrammable such that it may be reconfigured and utilized as an optical router, switch, or multi-protocol compatible gateway.* [Experimental Data Collection and Modeling for Nominal and Fault Conditions on Electro-Mechanical Actuators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2nya-d59e) - Being relatively new to the field, electromechanical actuators in aerospace applications lack the knowledge base compared to ones accumulated for the other actuator types, especially when it comes to fault detection and characterization. Lack of health monitoring data from fielded systems and prohibitive costs of carrying out real flight tests push for the need of building system models and designing affordable but realistic experimental setups. This paper presents our approach to accomplish a comprehensive test environment equipped with fault injection and data collection capabilities. Efforts also include development of multiple models for EMA operations, both in nominal and fault conditions that can be used along with measurement data to generate effective diagnostic and prognostic estimates. A detailed description has been provided about how various failure modes are inserted in the test environment and corresponding data is collected to verify the physics based models under these failure modes that have been developed in parallel. A design of experiment study has been included to outline the details of experimental data collection. Furthermore, some ideas about how experimental results can be extended to real flight environments through actual flight tests and using real flight data have been presented. Finally, the roadmap leading from this effort towards developing successful prognostic algorithms for electromechanical actuators is discussed.** [Thermally-Stable High Strain Deployable Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kc4e-swqs) - The proposed innovation is for the development of a thermally-stable composite made of carbon fibers and elastomeric resin. This combination of materials will allow a composite with higher stiffness and strain compared with materials currently in use for space. The significance of this innovation is that the proposed material will enable more capable deployable structures, minimize complexity, mass, and cost. Specifically the work done in Phase I and Phase II will enable cost effective components and subsystem technologies for flight systems, such as large sunshields and external occulters in Phase III.  The objective of this project will be to develop technologies and methods that improve the design, fabrication, modeling, inspection, and testing of composite materials for space deployable structures. This includes methods of testing and modeling/characterization of the material in order to guide its formulation. The characterization of the new elastomeric composite will be accomplished through a series of standardized tests, supported by non-standard tests as required.* [Fiber Optic Acoustic Emission system for structural health monitoring of Composite Pressure Vessels, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3ycn-e6w5) - Pressurized systems and pressure vessels used in NASA ground-based and flight-based applications including fuel tanks, composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs), and composite tankage commonly suffer from several types of degradation including fatigue, cracking, lack of bonding, and leakage. Veraphotonics proposes to develop a pressure vessel leak and damage detection system. In a large vessel, in-line inspection using health-monitoring sensors would provide structural integrity assessment, reduce maintenance, and eliminate potential points of failure. Acoustic Emission (AE) method is the most prevalent method that provides continuous monitoring for leak and damage detection  as well as estimates the location of leak or damage in pressure vessels. In this SBIR Phase I project, the feasibility of a novel laser-based interrogation technique AE method for the detection of leak and damages in liquid-filled vessel instrumented with FBG sensors will be performed in laboratory and field vessels including COPVs.  Based on laboratory and field test measurements, we will optimize the FBG sensors and the system to reduce or eliminate the acoustic background noise from the vessel environment. In Phase II all the FBG sensors will be integrated on a single optical fiber and interrogated using a compact, battery powered interrogation device with wireless data transmission capability.* [MOPITT CO gridded daily means (Near and Thermal Infrared Radiances) V007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u82y-6yzg) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals.

It is not just a matter of stereo being better than 2D, but of stereo being necessary to interpret representations of complex data sets, physical phenomena, engineering designs and position in space.  The US Air Force has long recognized the potential for 3D displays in the cockpit but until now the limitations of 3D display technology have prevented implementation.  Interest in 3D image display has recently surfaced among SPAWAR and among agencies who use helicopters and firms that make camera systems for helicopters for use in power line inspection, law enforcement, and military applications. There is also interest in the use of plane mounted cameras in collision avoidance while taxiing on runways, where 3D display may be of benefit because it can show the pilot how much room there is between the plane and obstacles. 3D displays for these applications must be of the glasses free type, but current embodiments of such displays possess extremely low resolution, produce visual artifacts, and tend to produce very narrow viewing areas.  Under a recent DOE SBIR Phase II contract DTI developed a new glasses free 2D/3D switchable display that avoids the resolution loss, visual artifacts, and viewing restrictions associated with all other autostereoscopic displays, providing full HD resolution in 3D as well as in a 2D viewing mode.  DTI's believes that this new technology can lead to the first practical implementation of a 3D display in the cockpit. During this Phase I program DTI will investigate the adaptation of its 2D/3D displays to cockpit displays through compact design, ruggedizing, and the development of mechanical, electronic, computer, and software interfaces to an aircraft system.  This investigation will lead to a high level design and specification for a prototype display that can developed in Phase II and delivered for testing in a cockpit or simulator.* [Global Annual Average PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/d5b9-96tw) - Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data set represents a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data. Together the grids provide a continuous surface of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. The satellite AOD retrievals were converted to ground-level concentrations based on a conversion factor developed by researchers at Dalhousie University that accounts for spatial and temporal variations in aerosol properties and vertical structure as derived from a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 30 arc-minutes (0.5 degree or approximately 50 sq. km at the equator) and cover the world from 70 degrees N to 60 degrees S latitude. The grids were produced by researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute in collaboration with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network/Columbia University under a NASA-ROSES project entitled "Using Satellite Data to Develop Environmental Indicators: An Application of NASA Data Products to Support High Level Decisions for National and International Environmental Protection". Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature death as well as increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease, especially in the elderly, young children, and those already suffering from these illnesses. The World Health Organization guideline for PM2.5 average annual exposure is less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms per cubic meter, whereas the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) primary standard is less than or equal to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter.

The PowerCube concept integrates three innovative component technologies to provide these capabilities:  First, a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) water-electrolysis fuel cell supplies gH2/gO2 to a simple pressure-fed thruster to provide 300 Ns of impulse per 100 mL of water. This approach enables the CubeSat to launch with 'inert' propellant to comply with P-POD limitations on stored energy and then process the water on-orbit into high-Isp fuel. Second, a deployable solar array that stows along the long sides of the CubeSat and deploys in a 'windmill' configuration provides up to 96 W peak. Third, a 3DOF 'carpal-wrist' gimbal, in conjunction with magnetic torque coils, enables sun-tracking of the solar panel, vectoring of the thruster, and precision pointing of payloads. The combination of ample power and water electrolysis will provide up to 6 m/s of delta-V per 90 minute orbit for a 3U CubeSat. Compared to other CubeSat propulsion technologies, the PowerCube thruster will enable more rapid orbital maneuvering and significantly lower contamination issues.  Our Phase I effort developed a detailed baseline design for the PowerCube, and built and tested a proof-of-concept prototype of the water-electrolysis thruster.  The Phase II effort will mature the electrolysis thruster component to the engineering model level, develop and simulate methods for attitude control and precise pointing of both panels and payloads using the gimbal and torque coils, and develop a detailed design for the entire PowerCube module to enable flight validation in follow-on Phase III efforts.* [A Novel Low-cost, Ka-band, High Altitude, Multi-Baseline Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Sensor for Surface Water Ocean Topography, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mmea-gshd) - This proposal presents the Ka-band SWOT Phenomenology Airborne Radar (KaSPAR) to support the surface water ocean topography (SWOT) mission for science and algorithm development and calibration and validation.

The concept of Cryogenic Hydrogen Radiation Shielding (CHRS) was studied by&nbsp;Cryogenic Branch at NASA GSFC&nbsp;with a FY08 IRAD. This IRAD project will complete a preliminary thermal and ground cooling system design of the CHRS system and also perform a radiation transmission test with potential CHRS tank materials.</p> <p>The objectives of this IRAD study are to perform the preliminary thermal system design and optimization of the CHRS system and to perform radiation testings of samples of materials that are candidates for containing the hydrogen in the CHRS.</p><p>The previous study of the concept proposed a potential CHRS geometry. We can meet the thermal design&nbsp;requirements by using proper cryogenic thermal management techniques. Various design&nbsp;options will be investigated for the fluid management system. The fluid management system will provide the required fluid distribution in the tank, and suppress the formation of large gas bubbles. We will use a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis tool ANSYS FLUENT&reg; to analyze and optimize the performance of the fluid management system.</p><p>In addition to the work above, the tank materials will be selected based on the thermal performance. The radiation test for these materials will be carried out at NASA Center for Radiation Engineering and Science for Space Exploration (CRESSE).</p><p>This FY 2014 IRAD study will increase the CHRS TRL level to 2. The design will prove the concept and increase the feasibility of the CHRS system. &nbsp;The output from this study can be used to pursue research opportunities for the radiation shielding at NASA&rsquo;s Human Research Program (HRP).</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Justification</strong></p><p>Human susceptibility to the harsh space radiation environment has been identified as being a major hurdle for exploration beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). High energy protons and nuclei ions from Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) can result in radiation doses that are dangerous to astronaut health and even survivability if the astronauts are not adequately shielded. The high energy particles also cause significant amounts of secondary radiation when they impinge on Aluminum, which is commonly used for spacecraft structure. The secondary neutron radiation may cause human radiogenic cancers. Hydrogen or hydrogen rich materials are ideal materials for radiation shielding because of hydrogen does not easily break down to form secondary radiation source.</p><p>A &nbsp;CHRS concept study was conducted by the Cryogenics and Fluids Branch in FY08. The results showed the most mass effective material for protecting a spacecraft if proper design is implemented. The performance of three candidate materials was studied in a LaRC study.&nbsp;</p>* [Visualization in Real-Time Experiment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3sj9-yb5x) - <p>With the increase in quantity and complexity of launches at the Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) there is an ever-growing need for a more capable real-time visualization system for the WFF Range Control Center (RCC).&nbsp; This system should have the ability to depict the vehicle using actual CAD vehicle models, display vehicle attitude and stage separation events, and utilize robust network protocol suitable for real-time safety applications.&nbsp; This project will use existing WFF hardware systems and leverage past experiences and lessons learned to produce a Visualization in Real-Time Experiment (VIRTEx) application that will use a cutting edge message protocol for lab demonstration and use during real-time operations.</p> <p>The objective of this project will be to migrate some of the outputs from the WFF Mission Planning Lab (MPL) into a real-time visualization system.&nbsp; The MPL is responsible for generating pre-flight RF margin link analysis, mission simulation &amp; visualization, and other products for WFF missions.&nbsp; This real-time visualization system would depict in 3D graphics the position and orientation of the launch vehicle(s) or suborbital carrier (UAV, sounding rocket), VIRTEx would be expanded to use a more flexible publish/subscribe architecture, and the system will leverage recently developed advanced telemetry and data handling systems within the Range network.</p><p>Another main objective will be updating VIRTEx to support a sounding rocket mission which is scheduled to launch from NASA Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) in the summer of 2014.</p><p>This project will also be used to demonstrate the successful attitude data conversion from a WFF telemetry system.&nbsp; Updates are being finished on this telemetry system that convert various NASA Sounding Rocket attitude control systems (ACS) data formats.&nbsp; Multiple ACS systems output different data formats, so libraries and algorithms were added to the telemetry system to convert this data into a standard yaw, pitch, and roll dataset for Range Safety.&nbsp; VIRTEx will be able to easily show this data and will be able to compare it to the pre-flight attitude predictions.</p>* [A New Approach to Uncertainty Reduction in Launch Vehicle Compartment Venting](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dqet-7af5) - <p>Launch vehicle compartments are vented to the external environment during ascent to minimize undesirable structural loading. Prediction of venting performance is an essential element of launch vehicle design and mission development. However, because of complex interactions between the vent flow and the high-speed external flow, there is substantial uncertainty in those predictions. This limitation results in unnecessary vehicle structural mass (reducing payload mass) and increased risk of vehicle or payload loss or damage from structural failure or malfunction. The focus of this project is a novel vent concept offering more predictable performance.</p> <p>Launch vehicle compartments (e.g. interstage, fairings, payload shroud, etc.) are vented to the external flow during ascent to relieve the internal pressure as the external pressure falls. Vents are openings between the internal compartment and the external environment. They can range in configuration from simple &quot;holes&quot; (orifices) in the vehicle skin to substantially more complicated arrangements. The objectives of the venting system are to minimize adverse differential-pressure loading of the vehicle skin, prevent ingestion of hot gas from the external boundary-layer, and control the compartment depressurization rate to avoid payload damage and ensure proper shroud separation. These requirements are often conflicting, creating a complex design situation where too much venting can be worse than too little.</p><p>A transient venting analysis is conducted during vehicle development to determine suitable vent sizes &amp; locations and the resulting structural loads. The present state of the art in venting analysis and design is based on a legacy capability (developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s) that is less than ideal. One known deficiency is that the level of uncertainty in the prediction of vent performance is significant. This uncertainty has costs associated with it. One is that the vehicle structure is over-conservative to account for uncertainty in the predicted skin loads, resulting in an unnecessary reduction in payload capacity. Another cost is the increased risk of damage or malfunction&nbsp;that compromises mission objectives (e.g. 1973 Saturn-V/Skylab-1) or catastrophic failure resulting in vehicle/payload loss. During the 1990s, there was a series of Long March shroud separation failures that were attributed to venting. Recent unexplained shroud separation failures may also be venting related.</p><p>While the prediction of launch vehicle compartment venting involves a number of inputs, and corresponding sources of uncertainty, it depends to a large extent on the precision with which the flow characteristics of the vents are known. Unfortunately, the fluid mechanics of a vent discharging into a high-speed cross-flow is extremely complex and not well understood. Consequently, the prediction of vent performance relies on empirically derived discharge coefficients. Such data for compressible cross-flow conditions are extremely limited. Moreover, these data exhibit large variations in measured cross-flow discharge coefficient for supposedly identical test conditions. The inconsistencies may be due to unsteadiness, hysteresis, bi-stable phenomena, and/or experimental error. The deficiencies in the available data are presently handled by setting upper and lower limits to bound the observed vent flow characteristics. However, those limits differ by a factor of five in some cases. Another problem is that the experimental data are restricted to idealized vent geometries (i.e. a sharp-edged orifice in a thin plate). How well these data represent the performance of real flight-configuration vents (which can include ducting pathways, screens, rain shields, one-way valves, etc.) is an open question.</p><p>The focus of this project is a novel vent concept offering more predictable performance.</p>* [Global Annual Average PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9ngx-pgpc) - Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data sets represent a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data.

For many applications, this field selector improves instrument efficiency proportionally to the number of shutters opened simultaneously. We have successfully developed and built the JWST microshutter array system, which increases the observing efficiency of the Near Infrared Spectrometer by two orders of magnitude. As a result of this development, there is a significant scientific demand for these devices for space-based and ground based applications. The availability of large format microshutters can significantly increase the scientific reach of spectroscopic survey instrument such as WFIRST and future missions such as ATLAST. The basic design of the JWST MSA cannot be extended to such a large scales due to the design limitations set by the required magnetic actuation. We have recently demonstrated shutter operation using DC plus AC resonant pumping. The breakthrough demonstrates that we are able to eliminate bulky permanent magnets used for JWST MSA actuation, thus opening an avenue to create a very large focal plane field selector that can be built at much lower cost. in this program, we will fabricate electrostatically actuated microshutter arrays and demonstrate their performance for use as UV, visible, and infrared field selectors.* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV-B Erythemal Local Noon Irradiance Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6tq4-mznt) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV-B Erythemal Local Noon Irradiance Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

Three approaches are combined to develop a system that will meet current and future NASA needs and exceed currently available power processor unit (PPU) performance in terms of electrical efficiency, specific mass (kg/kW), and cost.   The approaches include the use of (a) high-efficiency, 3-phase, dc-dc converters to minimize cooling requirements, mass, and parts count and maximize reliability and efficiency, (b) modularized and standardized sub-system design and fabrication techniques to accommodate power output scaling and re-configuration for specific ion thruster designs without the need to re-qualify hardware, and (c) attention to cost and manufacturability issues that will allow the implementation of electric propulsion systems on future NASA missions without the hidden costs of "hard-to-build" and "hard-to-scale" designs that are currently available.   The innovations proposed herein will allow NASA to obtain the flexibility and performance it needs in power processors for electric propulsion systems while ensuring that their cost and difficulty of fabrication is low.* [Thermal Protection Systems Nondestructive Evaluation Tool, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7k4c-6uue) - Based on the successful feasibility demonstration in Phase I, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to continue the development of a novel Thermal Protection System Nondestructive Evaluation Tool (THRON), which addresses NASA's need for evaluation of lightweight rigid and/or flexible ablative materials, and provides noncontact, one-sided in situ operation for accurate detection, identification, and precise spatial localization and measurements of internal and surface defects/voids, and evaluation of bondlines and in-depth integrity of such materials and also large-area multilayer thermal protection system (TPS) structures with complex geometries. THRON is based on POC-patented X-ray Compton imaging tomography and POC-patented apodized coded aperture X-ray imaging optics, substantially modified and optimized to meet NASA's requirements. The THRON Phase I prototype demonstrated excellent potential for detection and spatial localization of defects/voids with dimensions <6 mm by 6 mm by 6 mm, and bondline defects <12 mm by 12 mm by 200 &#956;m in TPS material and structures. At the end of Phase II, POC will perform a technology readiness level (TRL)-6 demonstration of THRON in POC's X-ray lab and/or at NASA facilities, and will deliver to NASA a working engineering model of an effective NDE tool.* [VEGA1 INFRARED SPECTROMETER IMAGING CHANNEL DATA V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/68h3-s9kp) - The IKS data from Vega-1 came in various forms. The initial submission from IKI by Dyachkov was in GROUP FITS (binary) for the 'imaging channel'. A separate submission came through the IHW Infrared Studies Discipline and also contained data presented in the FITS format (IHW keywords) for the two 'infrared channels'. In the former case, the three Pvalues carried information on the distance and two angles used to locate the position of the comet on the slit. The other simple keyword values marked only the date, mission, and experiment. The latter data, had not only 101 individual spectra for the 3-5 micron measurements but a composite 'final' 6-12 micron spectrum with associated 'figure 7' from the published results (COMBES, M. et al. 1988, Icarus, 76, 404). For these 101 spectra a cometo-centric distance was quoted rather than a time micron data. Using this information, the distance range was 270534.9 to 39273.22 km. From this comparison, it is inferred that the distance quoted in the IKI submission is also cometo-centric (31596.0 to 16092 km).* [Innovative Development of Kernel-Based Reduced-Order Models for Predicting LCO Onset, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g8i2-i62i) - Reducing uncertainty in the prediction of limit cycle oscillations (LCO) and other nonlinear aeroservoelastic phenomena is critical to flight safety.  To do so requires nonlinear methods.  First-principles based methods (CFD/CSD) have made considerable progress but still cannot predict LCO from the outset.  NEAR proposes the development of two innovative nonlinear data-based methods to characterize aeroservoelastic systems using flight-test data.  The proposed methods provide a natural extension of existing linear methods, provide uncertainty estimates of the prediction, and are applicable to flight-test data.  Both approaches are formally related.  However, their practical implementations place various limitations on the physics they represent.  The Phase I effort will document, on a benchmark test case, the advantages and disadvantages of each method.  Phase II will further develop the most promising approach and demonstrate its use on flight-test data, such as data from the F18-AAW.  Special emphasis will be placed on the problem of data generalization across flight conditions, which is key to ensuring safe and efficient envelope-expansion flight testing.* [SEDIMENT ANALYSIS NETWORK FOR DECISION SUPPORT (SANDS) LANDSAT GEOTIFF V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ek5b-m3tp) - The Sediment Analysis Network for Decision Support (SANDS) analyzes Geotiff images for sediment redistribution after a hurricane on the Gulf coast and then creates a product based on the analysis.

Subsetted coordinates are 31-27N latitude and 90-84.25W longitude (Gulf of Mexico coastline in Alabama and portions of Florida).  These are seasonal data for storms.* [SMEX03 Airborne GPS Bistatic Radar Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/b32m-a5gv) - This data set contains measurements of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals reflected from the Earths surface and collected on an airborne platform. The measurements were taken over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) regional study areas of Brazil and Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA. The primary objective was to collect land reflections for sensitivity of the reflected GPS power to temporal and spatial soil moisture and foliage attenuation. The measurements are a form of bistatic radar and can be used to estimate the surface scattering coefficient, such as roughness and/or dielectric properties, as well as path delays between the direct and reflected GPS signals. Scattering coefficients can then be used to estimate changes in surface soil moisture. The reflections collected were from agricultural land in Brazil, Alabama, and Georgia, along with grassland in Oklahoma. Data were collected on 24, 25, 27, 30 June 2003 and 2, 3, 5, 7, 12-15, 17, 18 July 2003.

The measurements include: air temperature, specific humidity, module of wind speed, downward long wave and shortwave radiation at the surface, surface pressure, precipitation, and carbon dioxide (CO2). These atmospheric data are provided at 1 hour time-steps. These data were used as the standardized forcing data input for the LBA Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-MIP).The LBA-MIP goal was to gain comparative understanding of ecosystem models that simulate energy, water, and CO2 fluxes over the LBA area. The task was to subject all the models to the same forcing and experimental protocol, and to compare the outputs. The protocol is provided as a companion file, lba_mip_protocol4.0_20100309.pdf.The source meteorological observations for the forcing data, from the nine Brazilian flux towers, were recently published as Saleska, et al. (2013). See related data sets. These source data were gap-filled according to the LBA-MIP standard protocol. Note that the CAX forest tower was not included in the MIP. See the companion file driver_data.pdf for additional gap-filling information.There are 34 data products with this data set and they are provided in both text (.txt) and ALMA-compliant NetCDF (.nc) formats.

At the same time the heat acquisition areas have trended downward, thereby increasing the incident heat flux. Current incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2. This is a severe limitation for axial groove aluminum/ammonia constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs). The maximum heat flux in a CCHP is set by the boiling limit, which typically start at 5 W/cm2 for axial grove wicks, and 20-30 W/cm2 for powder metal wicks. The innovation is to develop CCHPs with a hybrid wick, which has a sintered evaporator wick, and a conventional grooved adiabatic and condenser wick.  These hybrid wicks can operate at higher heat fluxes, allowing the use of higher power laser diodes.  They also allow the use of Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) in Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, which must operate at tilts up to 45°.  Conventional aluminum/ammonia heat pipes can only operate with a 0.1 inch tilt, so they are unsuitable.  Loop Heat Pipes can also operate with tilting, but they are two orders of magnitude more expensive.  A hybrid grooved and sintered wick CCHP will allow operating at higher heat fluxes as compared to axial groove design and can also operate against gravity on the planetary surface, operate in space, carrying power over long distances, act as a thermosyphon on the planetary surface for Lunar and Martian landers and rovers, and demonstrate a higher transport capability than an all-sintered wick.* [An Ideal Integrating Bolometer Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/weqe-p8h6) - <p>We propose to develop a novel detector to enable a new class of far-IR spectroscopic surveys.&nbsp; The detector, the Ideal Integrating Bolometer (IIB) is able to circumvent some of the inherent limitations on bolometers, and thus achieve dramatic improvement in sensitivity.<br />&nbsp;</p> <p>An ideal integrating bolometer can achieve breakthrough sensitivity in IR photon detection by removing practical barriers to extreme thermal isolation of the absorber.&nbsp; The effort will be focused on design of the IIB, with the goal of having a layout ready.&nbsp; During this period, we will also design parts needed for the test facility and start fabrication.&nbsp; In the second quarter, the IIBs will be fabricated.&nbsp; Also during this period, the test facility will be assembled and dry run testing completed.&nbsp; In the third quarter, the IIB samples will be installed in the cryostat and tested.

Chemical and mineralogical characterizations are critical components of this exploration. Infrared spectrometers provide a new spectroscopic capability to interrogate the feature-rich region of long-wave infrared. The objective of this work was to develop high performance in house long-wave barrier (8 &mu;m) infrared (LWIR) detectors tailored for the use in planetary spectrometers for characterization of primitive bodies.</p>
 <p>Currently, the major impediment for long wavelength instrumentation is the availability of sensitive detectors that can cover the region of interest &ndash; wavelengths up to approximately 7.5 &mu;m (or wavenumbers less than &asymp; 1330 cm1). Long-wave limits of current and recent spectrometers are 3 &mu;m (M3), 3.92 &mu;m (CRISM), and 5.1 &mu;m (VIMS). While useful for hydrides (and nitriles, CO, and CO2 for VIMS), these limited ranges are unsuitable for detection and characterization of most molecules and minerals of planetary interest and especially organic molecules. As an example, while the C-H stretch band in the 3-&mu;m region can indicate the presence of hydrocarbons, this band is not indicative of the type of chemical or functional group, i. e. alcohols, organic acids, esters, etc. Identification of these molecules requires information from other (and stronger) transitions occurring at longer wavelengths. Detection of such spectra in remote-sensing or in situ applications often requires high sensitivity long-IR detectors, particularly for diffusely reflected sunlight in outer solar system measurements. The high-quality detectors generally required for space and astronomical detectors were originally developed for the military, with the cut-off wavelengths chosen to match spectral transmission windows of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere (below 5 &mu;m for mid-IR and above 10 &mu;m for long-IR regions). Consequently, detectors with cut-off wavelengths between 5 and 10 &mu;m have never been produced in quantity and are not available except expensive custom items (multi million dollars) by external vendors. The unknown detector performance of external vendors such as environmental/planet radiation increases the risk of using detectors from external providers and increases the instrument cost to verify these components under these conditions. Therefore, the costs of such detectors are in the millions of dollar range with lead times longer than one year. This is a major driver in the overall cost of spectroscopic planetary instruments and poses a significant risk to the timely and successful delivery of the instruments. Therefore, the development of an in-house detector capability at the target 8 &mu;m wavelength with a route towards integration into planetary spectrometers takes away the risk and cost associated with external vendors and will make JPL&rsquo;s planetary instruments extremely competitive.</p>* [Automated Service Discovery using Autonomous Control Technologies, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hjc4-2yqs) - With the advent of mobile commerce technologies, the realization of pervasive computing and the formation of ad-hoc networks can be leveraged to the benefit of the NASA Spaceports in several technical areas.  The Automated Service Discovery (ASD) architecture will allow a portable real-time Expert System to be used to aid in the Service Discovery, management of communications links, and fault detection isolation and recovery for vehicle health management.  The ASD system will allow significant cost reductions for fielding and maintaining systems at the Spaceports.  Flight systems can save weight by relying on encrypted wireless links rather than connections to a wiring harness for data transfer.  Ground based systems can reconfigure on the fly using wireless and connection oriented ad-hoc networks.

This proposal also addresses the need for a standardized command, control and monitor system for ground and space infrastructure.  ASD will use the same Expert System for execution of the ASD algorithms to derive suggestions for least-cost paths for data connectivity.   The ASD system will provide a capability for the real-time Expert System to query for service capabilities and adjust goals and constraints based on available resources.  The ASD implementation will be machine, language, and operating system neutral.* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jwm3-dnmz) - ABSTRACT: The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. FASIR-NDVI data are also used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface. There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.* [Intelligent Flamefinder Detection and Alert System (IFDAS), Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/svtp-cpga) - Current hydrogen flame detection systems exhibit shortcomings ranging from limited detection range, to localization inaccuracy, limited sensitivity, false alarms, and inability to self-diagnose failures. During Phase I. International Electronic Machines Corporation IEM created and tested a prototype version of an Intelligent FlameFinder Detection and Alert System (IFDAS), demonstrating that IEM's system could accurately detect, track, and localize hydrogen flames and reliably discriminate between hydrogen flames and over two dozen sources of false alarms including reflections of flames or the sun, welding, other flame sources, etc., using a unique, innovative, and expandable Flame Detection Expert System design. In Phase II, IEM proposes to develop a full working prototype system employing multiple IFDAS sensor units, an enhanced flame detection expert system, and a comprehensive user interface including means for notifying emergency personnel when a fire is detected. This IFDAS Prototype will be demonstrated under real-world conditions at Stennis Space Center.* [The Case for Software Health Management](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a5ij-6vyn) - Software Health Management (SWHM) is a new field that is concerned with the development of tools and technologies to enable automated detection, diagnosis, prediction, and mitigation of adverse events due to software anomalies.
Significant effort has been expended in the last several decades in the
development of verification and validation methods for software
intensive systems, but it is becoming increasingly more apparent that this is
not enough to guarantee that a complex software system
meets all safety and reliability requirements. 

Modern software systems can exhibit a variety of failure modes which can go undetected in a verification and validation process.  While standard techniques for error handling, fault detection and isolation
can have significant benefits for many systems, it is becoming increasingly evident that new technologies and methods are necessary for the development of techniques to detect, diagnose, predict, and then mitigate the adverse events due to software that has already undergone significant verification and validation procedures.
These software faults often arise due to the interaction between the software
and the operating environment.
Unanticipated environmental changes lead to software anomalies that may have significant impact on the overall success of the mission.
Because software is ubiquitous, it is not sufficient that errors are
detected only after they occur. Rather, software must be instrumented and
monitored for failures before they happen.
This prognostic capability will yield safer and more dependable systems for the future.  This paper addresses the motivation, needs, and requirements of software health management as a new discipline.

The standardized ProPACS system integrates the essential elements needed for highly capable micro-spacecraft bus including; 1) 600 W Hall effect thruster system for primary propulsion, 2) Xe cold gas thrusters for propulsive ACS, 3) articulated solar array, batteries and power management and distribution (PMAD) system with steady state power of 700W available to the payload when propulsion is off and 4) an integral structure that supports the payload and a LightBand separation mechanism for the ESPA ring.  The ProPACS can provide over 1,800 m/sec deltaV to a 181 kg spacecraft with a 80kg payload.

In Phase 1 ProPACS system architecture design was completed and all major components were identified.  Mass, power, data budgets were developed and major interfaces were specified.  

Phase 2 focus will be on the ProPACS elements with lower TRL to achieve system wide TRL6 at the end of the program.  The thruster will be advanced to near flight level, two PMAD systems will be evaluated and one selected and the ProPACS integral structure supporting the payload and separation ring will be designed and built.* [LBA-ECO LC-39 MODIS Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6eut-cjkc) - This data set, Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment (LBA-ECO) LC-39 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007, provides active fire locations and estimates of annual fire frequencies. Data from the MODIS sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm.* [MOPITT Beta CO gridded monthly means (Near and Thermal Infrared Radiances) V107](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qwyv-wv5x) - The MOPITT Beta L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals and belong to an unvalidated beta product subject to recalibration.

The data were compiled from selected sources (Table 2) and integrated into gridded global and regional collections of climatology variables (precipitation, air temperature, air specific humidity, air relative humidity (NA only), pressure, downward longwave radiation, downward shortwave radiation, and wind speed), time-varying atmospheric CO2 concentrations, time-varying nitrogen deposition, biome fraction and type, land-use and land-cover change, C3/C4 grasses fractions, major crop distribution, phenology, multiple soil characteristics, and a land-water mask. The temporal ranges of the data are sufficient for carbon cycle model simulations from 1801 to 2010. These data were compiled specifically for the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Multi-Scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) as the prescribed model input driver data (Huntzinger et al., 2013). The driver data were used by 22 terrestrial biosphere models to run baseline and sensitivity simulations. The standardized data provided consistent model inputs to minimize the inter-model variability caused by differences in environmental drivers and initial conditions. Together with the sensitivity simulations, the standardized input data enable better interpretation and quantification of structural and parameter uncertainties of model estimates. Data are provided in Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata convention compliant (version 1.4) netCDF-4 file formats.

The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional Synthesis - Description of Observations and Models.* [Improved Lyman-Ultraviolet Astronomy Capabilities through Enhanced Coatings](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ynez-36jj) - <p>The &nbsp;Large Ultraviolet ,Visible, Optical, Infrared (LUVOIR) telescope concept is one of the &nbsp;NASA mission concept studies for&nbsp;the 2020 decadal study that will merge&nbsp;ultraviolet (UV) astrophysics and visible exoplanet science.

However, the Al has to be protected from the naturally occurring Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> oxide layer (when exposed to oxygen) with a thin film of a transparent material for use below 130 nm. Aluminum protected with fluorides such as LiF or MgF<sub>2</sub> have been the most commonly used solutions [4]. But below 102 nm down to 90 nm, no transparent material is available to protect Al and coating mirror reflectance stays well below 30%. But even above 102 nm, the reflectance of protected Al is limited by the residual absorption of the fluoride overcoats and the hygroscopic nature of the LiF overcoat.&nbsp; The low reflectivity of coatings in the Lyman Ultraviolet (LUV) range of 90-130 nm is one of the biggest constraints on FUV telescope and spectrograph design, and it limits the science return of FUV-sensitive space missions. In fact, to achieve high-reflectance in broadband coatings has been identified as an &ldquo;Essential Goal&rdquo; in the technology needs for the LUVOIR) surveyor observatory. Improved reflective coatings for optics, particularly in the LUV spectrum, could yield dramatically more sensitive instruments and permit more instrument design freedom. Furthermore, investigations in improving reflectance performance of coatings in this region has the potential to offer unprecedented return on investment given that the LUV contains the highest density of line observations in the UVVIS-IR spectrum.&nbsp;</p>* [Advanced Manufacturing Technologies for Miniaturized Instruments](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w4nu-n7wz) - <p>We will design and construct miniaturized instruments ideal for CubeSat/SmallSat and other planetary missions that are optimized for throughput while addressing fundamental limitations of miniaturization of instruments that are imposed by precision and fastener issues.&nbsp;</p>* [Habitat Particle Impact Monitoring System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jze4-mhd4) - <p>The purpose of this project is the development of particle impact detection technology for application to habitable space exploration modules, both in space and on the surfaces of Solar System bodies. This mission-enabling technology will be needed to improve the safety of future human exploration missions. Inflatable space structures have unique characteristics that would benefit from an instrument system for detecting impact penetrations and reporting the extent of these penetrations, as well as their size and location.  Building on previous experience, (i.e. the Habitat Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) hardware and software, which was developed for the Habitat Demonstration Unit) a system particularly adapted to the multilayer inflatable space structures can be developed.   The HIMS sensors represent a class of sensors that are both low mass, simply emplaced, and require little power or system resources.  This sensor system was applied to test sample coupons, representative of inflatable structures, modified as required, and subjected to hypervelocity impacts. Results of these tests allowed system verification for this type of space structure, with the ultimate goal to achieve an automatic impact location and characterization system for the inflatable space structure.<p/><p>The goal of the Habitat particle Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) is to develop a fully automated, end-to-end particle impact detection system for crewed space exploration modules, both in space and on planetary surfaces.  When micrometeoroids or orbital debris impacts occur on a space habitat, crew members need to be quickly informed of the likely extent of damage, and then take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the mission. HIMS uses multiple thin film piezo-polymer vibration sensors to detect impacts on a surface and characterize the impact locations and degree of penetration.  Installation of the HIMS sensors is easy, and does not require any major reconfiguration of the habitat structure. The detection capabilities of HIMS on a hard-shell structure were successfully demonstrated on the Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) Pressurized Excursion Module (PEM) during the 2010-2011 Desert Research and Technology Studies campaign. The main objective for the project in FY12 was to explore the feasibility of using HIMS for particle impact detection on multi-layer inflatable structures and determine optimum sensor configuration requirements for potential applications on future inflatable habitats. Hypervelocity impact tests were performed on a test article consisting of a spherical rubber bladder inflated within a Kevlar envelope "restraint layer". The tests showed that the system detects the impact in both the Kevlar layer and the rubber bladder.  The ring-down acoustic response of the simplified target indicates a signal detection range of at least 3 m from the point of impact.  It is hypothesized that an actual inflatable structure, with higher stiffness and thicker walls, would propagate the acoustical signals with less loss. Thus the system design and sensor configuration for inflatable structures is expected to be similar to designs and configurations already tested on rigid structures.</p>* [Graphene Field Effect Transistors for Radiation Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fwcs-3623) - <p>This is  propose to develop Graphene Field Effect Transistor based Radiation Sensors (GFET-RS) for NASA Manned Spaceflight Missions anticipated in next several decades.<p/><p>The device consists of a graphene piece deposited on a Si substrate with certain thickness of insulation layer. In our initial experiment, constant radiation was applied above the GFET and device conductance was measured before and after the radiation. We observed an increase of the device mobility (transconductance) after the radiation. This demonstration showed that graphene is radiation hard and its conductance changes with radiation. With the IRAD fund, we will continue exploring sensing mechanisms in GFETs and identify optimal absorber substrates and device geometries to improve radiation detection speed, sensitivity, and energy resolution of our GFET-RS devices.</p>* [Accelerating Memory-Access-Limited HPC Applications via Novel Fast Data Compression, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gi56-xesv) - A fast-paced continual increase on the ratio of CPU to memory speed feeds an exponentially growing limitation for extracting performance from HPC systems. Breaking this memory wall is one of the most important challenges that the HPC community faces today. In Phase I we introduced aggressive innovations enable the injection of unprecedented acceleration into vast classes of memory-access-bound HPC codes via ultra-fast software-based data compression. Groundbreaking speedup on a fully functional NPBCG prototype was delivered to NASA, thus validating the tremendous potential of our approach. The proposed approach is based on a revolutionary theory of compression spearheaded by Accelogic (Compressive Computing), which is able to provide enormous compressive gains for the typical floating point data of HPC applications. 
In Phase II we will build on our success with the NPBCG benchmark, and move boldly into tackling the acceleration of a real-life high-profile code, namely NASA's Cart3D, improving its performance by a paradigm-shifting 2x to 4x end-to-end wall-clock time acceleration by the end of Phase II. Our firm has accumulated crucial know-how and has synthesized its expertise into a powerful industrial-quality process for software acceleration that will be used to ensure success on completing Phase II objectives. In Phase II we also plan on injecting a second NASA code with basic Compressive Computing techniques, and providing it with base levels of acceleration of ~1.3-2x. We will choose this second code from a pool of high-profile codes that have already signed up as early adopters for this project: FUN3D, USM3D, Enzo, and WRF. The work on a second NASA code will also serve as the ultimate field test of the broadness and ease-of-infusion of the proposed technology.
We have secured complementary funds in the amount of $500,000 to increase resources and ensure that the proposed Phase II proposed will be successfully accomplished.* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/45wt-h3qq) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. (2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This data set is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [SAFARI 2000 Daily Rainfall Estimates, 0.1-Deg, Southern Africa, 1993-2001](https://data.nasa.gov/d/46m8-5peb) - The Microwave InfraRed Algorithm (MIRA) is used to produce an imagery data set of daily mean rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution over southern Africa for the period 1993-2001. MIRA combines passive microwave (PMW) from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) on board the DMSP F10 and F14 satellites at a resolution of 0.5 degrees and infrared (IR) data from the Meteosat 4, 5, 6, and 7 satellites in 2-hour slots at a resolution of 5 km. This approach accounts for the limitations of both data types in estimating precipitation. Rainfall estimates are produced at the high spatial and temporal frequency of the IR data using rainfall information from the PMW data. An IR/rain rate relationship, variable in space and time, is derived from coincident observations of IR and PMW rain rate (accumulated over a calibration domain) using the probability matching method. The IR/rain rate relationship is then applied to IR imagery at full temporal resolution. The results presented here are the daily means of those derived rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution.The rainfall data sets are flat binary images with no headers. They are compressed band sequential (bsq) files that contain all of the daily images for the given year. Each image is an array of 401 lines, each with 341 binary floating-point numbers, containing rainfall at 0.1 degree resolution for the area 10 to 50 degrees longitude and 0 to -34 degrees latitude. The number of band sequential images in each annual file and the associated dates can be found in the file MIRA_data_dates.csv.* [SAFARI 2000 Daily Rainfall Estimates, 0.1-Deg, Southern Africa, 1993-2001](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nvzt-gnee) - ABSTRACT: The Microwave InfraRed Algorithm (MIRA) is used to produce an imagery data set of daily mean rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution over southern Africa for the period 1993-2001.

Ground measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) were made using the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer and Sunfleck PAR ceptometer, respectively, during focused periods from August 20 to August 28, 2000 at a dry grassland site adjacent to the Sua Pan. The 1 km by 1 km sampling grid was a homogeneous, relatively dense grassland, with a height of 20-100 cm and two prevalent grass types, Odyssea paucinervis and Sporobolus spicatus. Associated reflectance measurements were made with the PARABOLA and ASD instruments (Helmlinger et al., 2004a; 2004b).The data files contain measurements of LAI and PAR reflectance and transmission and a description of sky conditions during the sampling periods. With one exception, all measurements were made under clear sky conditions.  PAR data were measured only on the transect scale while LAI are provided at both pixel and transect scales. PAR readings were performed at 93 transect sample points, and LAI readings were performed at 135 (93 transect and 42 subgrid) sample points. Each file also contains mean LAI and PAR values. The data files are ASCII tables, in comma-separated-value format.* [U.S. Population Grids (Summary File 1), 2000: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, Alpha Version](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gyx3-sg3c) - U.S. Population Grids (Summary File 1), 2000: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, Alpha Version contains an ARC/INFO Workspace with grids of demographic data from the year 2000 census.

Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.* [Model Based Aircraft Upset Detection and Recovery System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xagj-v2zf) - This proposal describes a system for detecting upset conditions and providing the corresponding control recovery actions to maintain flight integrity for general application to aircraft.  To maintain and improve aircraft safety as air capacity grows as part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS), it is necessary to address the primary causes leading to in-flight loss of control accidents, including aircraft upsets, degraded flight operations, and environmental disturbance effects.  A model-based upset detection and recovery control architecture is proposed that combines fault detection algorithms to identify the onset of an upset condition with optimal and near-optimal control responses.  On-line parameter identification algorithms are used to adapt the core detection and recovery algorithms for degraded flight operations and/or modeling uncertainties.  Distributed MEMS-based sensing and SMA-driven control effectors are used to augment the installed aircraft state measurements and control capability for rapid detection of and recovery from upset conditions.  During Phase I, preliminary system design and application to a small unmanned aircraft will be performed, including flight test demonstration of the upset detection and control algorithms and hardware.  This work will form the foundation for subsequent development of a family of aircraft upset mitigation systems for both manned and unmanned aircraft.* [Hydrogen Sulfide Micro-Sensor for Biomass Fouling Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/itqi-yn7s) - Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)is the leading chemical agent causing human fatalities following inhalation exposures.  The overall aim of this project is to develop and produce an inexpensive, highly selective and sensitive solid-state chemical micro-sensor with low power consumption that is suitable for rapid detection of very low-level (ppb) concentration of H2S in ambient air.
The technology principle used to develop the micro-sensor is based on the knowledge that H2S is adsorbed into gold at an operating temperature range.  By using a gold thin-film, and MEMS technology, we will produce a micro-sensor with the following specifications 1 mm x 1 mm micro-sensor, 3 seconds response and recovery time, 10 mW power consumption, and detection in the ppb range.
Phase I will investigate the feasibility of the design, fabrication, testing, and validation of the micro-sensor in collaboration with researchers from the Integrated Nanosystems Research Facility at the University of California Irvine.
During Phase II, the innovative solid-state micro-sensor will be integrated in a miniaturized battery powered wireless instrument for applications in biomass fouling detection.* [Precollimator Manufacturing for X-ray Telescopes, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rshe-fnu4) - Space-based x-ray telescopes currently involve the use of a precollimator (PC) to shield the optics from stray light. Each PC consists of cylindrical aluminum ribs (blades) with varying radii, alignment frames to guide the blade positions and the blade housing body. The alignment frame and the housing are made of Aluminum 6061 and 7075 alloy, respectively. A heat-forming process with thin aluminum sheets is used to produce the ribs that run between the alignment frame.

We are proposing a new method to build a PC out with emerging technologies, using Additive Manufacturing (AM) to build a blank that is the rough shape of the PC but with thickened ribs and then using wire Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) to cut the final shape. This will result in an easier to produce PC, with more rigidity due to its integral structure and potentially thinner and better positioned blades. It will also be made of Titanium instead of Aluminum and have a less shiny surface finish, both of which are more favorable characteristics in stray light blocking.
We plan to design a Test Article that mimics the size and location configuration of the current PC technology. We plan to investigate the competing AM processes of Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) and Electron Beam Welding (EBM) to determine which one is a better process for the blank fabrication and if there are any potential limitations to either technology. Then we will use a cutting-edge technology wire EDM machine to cut the final shape in the blank and determine what limitations exist in positioning accuracy and thickness of the blades. We anticipate both to be better than the current PC technology.* [Accelerating Memory-Access-Limited HPC Applications via Novel Fast Data Compression, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3dnc-dufy) - A fast-paced continual increase on the ratio of CPU to memory speed feeds an exponentially growing limitation for extracting performance from HPC systems. Ongoing developments and trends make it clear that this ratio will keep increasing over the next decade. Breaking this memory wall is one of the most important challenges that the HPC community faces today. In this project we introduce novel and highly effective ways of attacking the memory wall through the use of "compressive computing," a theory that we have invented, developed, and successfully put into practice in other areas of HPC with paradigm-shifting results. Once integrated into memory-bound HPC applications, the proposed technology will support significant acceleration factors (typically beyond 2x) without compromising the numerical accuracy of the application code.  In Phase I we will develop the fundamentals of the theory of compressive computing for memory access acceleration, deploy a set of functional components, and produce a fully functional prototype that demonstrates convincingly that the technology works for acceleration of memory-bound applications. The prototype will be integrated in at least one NAS Parallel Benchmark. In Phase II we will focus our work on maturing and refining the technology, and will be driven by a concrete target of accelerating at least two memory-access-bound NASA applications. Five of the top eight most-used application codes in NASA supercomputers have already signed-in as early integrators of the technology. We have secured complementary funds in the amount of $150,000 that we will be able to use to increase resources and ensure that all Phase I proposed work will be successfully accomplished in a timely manner, and a total of $500,000 to ensure a successful and early penetration of the proposed technology into the market.* [Aircraft Flight Envelope Identification through On-Board Model Based Estimation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6pd2-jz9h) - To improve aviation safety with anticipated growth in capacity, it is necessary to develop flight control technologies that enable safe operations as anomalous conditions occur.  These developments are particularly important to reduce fatal loss of control accidents due to aircraft degradation and abrupt aerodynamic changes including upsets.  It is necessary to develop methods to identify and characterize anomalies in flight, as well as to estimate the impacts on the flight envelope and the ability to effect control forces for recovery and/or flight planning to achieve safe landing.  An approach to identify anomalies including aerodynamic upsets based on model-based fault detection methods will be combined with physics-based models to assess the impact on the aircraft flight envelope and controllability.  These tools will permit off-line analysis and will facilitate the development of on-board guidance and control algorithms to support NASA goals for greater aircraft resiliency during adverse flight conditions.  In Phase I, development and demonstration of a generalized system architecture to identify and assess the effects of aircraft anomalies will be performed, which builds upon previous work toward model-based aircraft upset detection.  Phase I demonstrations will include simulation evaluation for a generic transport aircraft and test demonstration for a small unmanned aircraft.* [Poverty Mapping Project: Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pg7t-47w5) - The Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition dataset consists of estimates of the

United Silicon Carbide, Inc. proposes to develop and commercialize a unique JFET-based monolithically-integrated radiation-tolerant solar blind active pixel sensor (APS) UV imager.  Silicon carbide is the ideal materials system due to its negligible dark currents, excellent radiation tolerance, intrinsic insensitivity to visible and near IR light, and technological maturity.  The Silicon carbide JFET is an ideal choice as an IC building block, as it is immune to the presence of stacking faults in wafer material and is free from possible threshold voltage drifting associated with the SiC MOSFET.
The proposed PiN and LJFET based APS circuitry has the potential for reliable operation at temperatures exceeding 150 C.  The proposed design of the active pixel sensor can be adopted for detection of more energetic particles, such as EUV and soft-X-ray, by increasing the thickness of the active low doped layer. Such APS detector arrays could be custom designed, including pixel size and epilayer thickness, and would be of nearly UNIVERSAL USE in nuclear particle detection and spectroscopy. 
While the active pixel sensor market is niche, applications in related Silicon Carbide LJFET based analog processes offering temperature operation above 200 C have tremendous value in the commercial, industrial & high temperature market space.  LJFET IC building blocks such as voltage references, oscillators, comparators and regulators form the cell circuits for such products as PWM controllers, power transistor gate drivers, voltage regulators and amplifiers.* [A Three-Dimensional Nanoporous Silicon Anode for High-Energy Density Lithium-ion Batteries, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fdyg-ufmq) - This SBIR phase I program is directed toward the development of novel, nanoporous silica anodes for low-earth-orbiting (LEO) spacecraft power applications. Silica has attracted a lot of attention as a next-generation anode material because of its very high theoretical capacity compared to state-of-the-art graphitic carbon anodes. However, its use in Li-ion battery applications is limited by its poor cycle stability caused by large volume changes experienced during Li insertion and extraction. The unique pore structure of materials developed in this program will overcome this limitation and realize rechargeable Li-ion cells with high-specific energy and extremely stable cycle life for LEO spacecraft power applications.* [LBA-ECO LC-23 Characterization of Vegetation Fire Dynamics for Brazil: 2001-2003](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9qis-bhm9) - ABSTRACT: Satellite fire detection was determined from two sensors, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA-12 and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on both the Terra and Aqua platforms, for 2001- 2003 to characterize fire activity in Brazil, giving special emphasis to the Amazon region. Active fire data for AVHRR/NOAA-12 was produced using a fixed threshold fire detection technique based on the algorithm developed by the Centro de Previsao do Tempo e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC/INPE) (Setzer and Pereira, 1991; Setzer et al., 1994; Setzer and Malingreau, 1996). Active fire data for MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua was produced using a contextual fire detection technique based on NASA-University of Maryland algorithm (Justice et al., 2003; Giglio et al.2003).Resulting fire counts were compared for major biomes of Brazil (Figure 1), the nine states of the Legal Amazon (e.g., Tocantins, Figure 2), and two important road corridors in the Amazon region (Figure 3). In evaluating the daily fire counts, there is a dependence on variations in satellite viewing geometry, overpass time, atmospheric conditions, and fire characteristics (Schroeder et al., 2005).

TRMM was successfully launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.

The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a nine-channel passive microwave radiometer, which builds on the heritage of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument flown aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. Microwave radiation is emitted by the Earth's surface and by water droplets within clouds. However, when layers of large ice particles are present in upper cloud regions - a condition highly correlated with heavy rainfall - microwave radiation tends to scatter at frequencies above 19 GHz. The TMI detects radiation at five frequencies chosen to discriminate among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood of rainfall. The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by this method is the deduction of cloud precipitation consistent with the radiation measurement at each frequency. The TMI frequencies are 10.65, 19.35, 37 and 85.5 GHz (dual polarization), and 21 GHz (vertical polarization only).

The Level 1A product file (1A11) is a concatenation of the Level 0 data with a header record and, as such, is reversible to Level 0. The header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbit number, times of the first scan and number of scans, among other things. The Level 0 data contain the actual channel data expressed as "sensor counts." A file contains data for a single orbit with a file size of about 7 MB (uncompressed).  There are 16 files of TMI 1A11 data produced per day.

Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.

Many such applications require data storage solutions that provide high storage capacities while abiding strict power consumption limitations. Specifically, the need for radiation-hard non-volatile memories is a long-standing problem in the space community. The proposed work describes a progression toward a radiation-hard, high performance non-volatile memory device by implementing principles from terrestrial memory technology using two-dimensional nanomaterials with proven radiation hardness.

Graphene, consisting of a single-atom thick hexagonal carbon lattice, has been shown to exhibit a number of superlative qualities as a nanoelectronic material for many applications. Perhaps most relevantly, graphene has recently been incorporated as the floating gate (FG) layer of a flash memory cell, resulting in improved device performance. Single layer MoS(2) is a three-atom thick material that shares many of the desirable electronic qualities of graphene. In addition, MoS(2) thin-film transistors (TFTs) have demonstrated superior switching capability compared to graphene. These qualities make MoS(2) an exceptional candidate as a channel material for a FG flash memory device. Finally, self-assembled nanodielectrics (SANDs) are a unique class of hybrid organic/inorganic dielectric thin films that boast low leakage current and high dielectric constant. The integration of SANDs with graphene and many other low dimensional nanomaterials has demonstrated improved TFT device performance compared to traditional gate dielectric materials. Initial tests suggest SANDs are hard to ionizing radiation, and the total ionizing dose (TID) response of graphene has been studied, resulting in strong evidence that graphene is TID-hard as well. By analogy to the two-dimensional structure of graphene, MoS(2) is likely to be TID-hard as well. As long-term TID effects are the primary concern in a FG flash memory cell, the incorporation of graphene, MoS(2), and SANDs into a FG flash memory device holds promise for a radiation-hard nonvolatile memory.

This integration will require that that SANDs be deposited atop graphene and MoS(2). Existing variants of SANDs are presently deposited only on SiO(2) terminated surfaces, limiting thin-film transistor devices to those having a global back gate geometry on a Si wafer. Moreover, deposition of ultrathin oxide materials on graphene (and possibly MoS(2)) has historically proven problematic, as its surface chemistry impedes the deposition of uniform, high quality dielectric films. Recently, the Hersam Laboratory has developed a fabrication scheme that uses a self-assembled organic seeding layer to facilitate the deposition of ultrathin, conformal oxide materials on graphene via atomic layer deposition (ALD). The extension of this scheme to the vapor deposition of SANDs on graphene and MoS(2) represents a significant challenge that will necessitate the development of a new SAND material and deposition process that is compatible with ALD. Overall, the proposed device structure motivates the following research objectives: 
Development of a novel SAND variant that is compatible with atomic layer deposition. 
Integration of SAND on graphene by deposition on organic self-assembled monolayers. 
Integration of SAND on MoS2 by deposition on organic self-assembled monolayers. 
Complete assembly and testing of MoS(2)/SAND/graphene FG flash memory device.* [Advanced Aqueous Phase Catalyst Development using Combinatorial Methods, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3nas-93hw) - Combinatorial methods are proposed to develop advanced Aqueous Oxidation Catalysts (AOCs) with the capability to mineralize organic contaminants present in effluents from current and future primary wastewater treatment processes at temperatures less than 70aC, pressures below 20 psig, and contact times under 30 minutes.  The Phase II effort will build upon the successful Phase I feasibility demonstration and identify rate-limiting factors for contaminant oxidation identified in the best Phase I AOCs.  A new series of combinatorial catalysts will be prepared with the goal to systematically improve catalyst performance.  Improvements will focus on contaminant and reaction byproduct adsorption, mass transfer resistances, and reaction rate limitations associated with noble metal concentration, dispersion, and support interaction.  A second-generation combinatorial library with 102 AOCs will be prepared based on this analysis.  Oxidation activity will then be compared using a difficult to oxidize ersatz solution containing contaminants known to occur in the current U.S. water processor aboard the ISS.  These tests will select the best AOC based upon analysis of oxidation kinetics.  This AOC will undergo long-term testing to verify performance.  Scale-up activities will follow, resulting in a full-scale, deliverable prototype.  The advanced AOC will lower water processor ESM and provide multiple commercial opportunities.* [Nanorack Compatible Standardized Data Processing, Communication, and Control Module, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/b9a8-em5d) - This Phase I study will design and develop a NanoRacks Control Module
(NCM) that provides communications, control functions and data
processing in a NanoRacks compatible CubeLab form factor. This standard
module is intended to dramatically reduce the development time and cost
for an experiment to be flown in a Nanoracks module. Certain aspects of
a NanoRacks compatible experiment stay the same regardless of the type
of experiment. The proposed NanoRacks Control Module provides
communications compatible with the NanoRacks module. This includes
methods for preparing data generated in the NanoRacks CubeLab module for
download, as well as communications and commands to the NanoRacks
CubeLab module. The NanoRacks Control Module is configurable by the user
to generate and receive various signal and data types that may be
required for the experiment. The NanoRacks Control Module has its own
series of sensors that can provide baseline data about the experiment in
process, such as vibration and temperature. In addition, the NCM has a
battery operating mode that allows for the environment to be monitored
before flight and attachment to the NanoRacks frame.* [ANSIBLE: A Network of Social Interactions for Bilateral Life Enhancement, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mjw8-cp3j) - ANSIBLE (A Network of Social Interactions for Bilateral Life Enhancement) can be used pre, during, and post flight to connect the flight crew with their family, friends, and the ground crew to provide a sense of social consistency and permanence. ANSIBLE is a multi-modal toolset that 1) adapts, rearranges, and modifies human interaction streams to minimize the disruptive impact of communication latencies and 2) leverages virtual worlds (VW) to provide a space where humans and intelligent virtual agents (VA) can be companions, advisors, provided psychological support, and share experiences.  VAs capable of detecting changes in astronaut psychosocial states can increase astronaut self-awareness, suggest countermeasures, and provide rehearsal scenarios to maintain and enhance interpersonal skills.  University of Southern California(USC)'s Institute of Creative Technologies (ICT) have been at the forefront of applying VWs and VAs to training, therapy, and even detection of depression.  SIFT will leverage its ongoing work with NASA's BHP group in unobtrusive detection of psychosocial dimensions, and  work together with Dr. Jacquelyn Morie to apply and enhance these technologies to define the future social landscape that connects the flight crew with Earth.* [Quantifiable and Reliable Structural Health Management Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cxpd-rt5q) - Major concerns for implementing a practical built-in structural health monitoring system are prediction accuracy and data reliability. It is proposed to develop robust state-of-the-art structural health management (SHM) technologies to overcome these concerns.  The proposed solution will be capable of detecting and quantifying damage with a high probability of detection (POD), accurately predicting the residual strength and remaining life of the structures with confidence, and providing information which will allow appropriate preventative actions on the monitored structure. To achieve the objectives the proposed technology will first optimize the sensor network configuration for the SHM system to achieve the highest probability of detection.  Next, robust diagnostic techniques will be developed to achieve quantifiable damage location and size estimation that account for the uncertainties induced by the environments or the system itself continuously during flight or at scheduled maintenance intervals. Finally, efficient probabilistic prognostic methods will be integrated with diagnostic outputs to provide real time estimation of residual strength and remaining life of the damaged structure. Both metallic and composite stiffened aircraft panels will be instrumented and tested under simulated flight conditions to validate the proposed technology. The work will be performed collaboratively between Acellent and Stanford University.* [SMEX03 Surface and Soil Temperature Measurements: Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vfqy-gzkw) - This data set contains land surface temperature and soil temperature data at depths of 1 cm, 5 cm, and 10 cm collected during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03). The data were collected from 21 June 2003 to 2 July 2003 in northern Alabama and southern Tennessee, USA at crop, pasture, and forested sites. Data are provided in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and an ASCII text file, and are available via FTP.

These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.* [High power density metal junction thermoelectric (TE) power generators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/42th-2q4h) - <p>High efficiency direct energy conversion is still a daunting challenge. The efficiency of state-of-the-art, semiconductor based thermoelectrics (TE) is in the range of only about 7~10% efficiency.&nbsp; The poor performance of conventional TE devices is due to the fundamentally limited potential well that is intrinsically determined by the population of doping materials. Developmental efforts in TE materials have so far only focused on lowering thermal conductivity in order to increase the figure of merit. Implicitly, this practice also lowers the overall energy flow through the TE system, resulting in low power density. &nbsp;A new approach based on metallic junctions will be implemented in this project to enhance thermoelectric performance beyond the state-of-the-art limit of the conventional concept and approach.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The performance of conventional TE devices is determined by the figure of merit (ZT): <em>ZT</em> = <em>S<sup>2</sup>&sigma;T</em>/<em>k</em> (<em>S</em>: Seebeck coefficient, <em>&sigma;</em>: electrical conductivity, <em>k</em>: thermal conductivity, and <em>T</em>: temperature). It must be noted that this figure of merit relates to the fundamental performance of the thermoelectric domain, and not necessarily to actual power delivered by a thermoelectric generator. The challenge in developing conventional thermoelectric materials with enhanced performance is being able to engineer the thermal and electrical parameters separately. Research to date has focused on morphological design and nanometer sized structures to lower thermal conductivity (<em>k</em>) in order to improve <em>ZT</em>. The reduction of the lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity directly improves <em>ZT</em>, and can be achieved through nanostructural design. However, lowering the thermal conductivity by introducing nanostructured dislocations and boundary conditions for phonon scattering, which disrupts the thermal transport, has not improved the figure of merit as anticipated. More importantly, these physical dislocations have not enhanced the power delivery of the thermoelectric devices.</p>

<p>This is largely due to a fact that lowering the thermal conductivity also reduces heat flow into a TE domain. Since the initial loading of thermal energy into a domain is substantially reduced by lowered thermal conductivity, there is a reduction in thermal energy in the domain to be converted into power. This is why the conventional TE principle has NOT worked favorably, despite the expenditure of significant resources and enormous effort. The charge carrier density in semiconductor-based TE materials is limited to the electron densities of 1 C/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>The aim of this project is to develop a new TE concept based on metal junctions, which will substantially increase the TE efficiency and power density resulting in substantially increased power delivery by TE generators. Metals have intrinsically high electron densities &gt;10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> C/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is several orders of magnitude higher than the best semiconductors. Metal junctions are also easier to make than semiconductor junctions, which need an additional doping process. These factors combine to enable the fabrication of high efficiency, high power density energy conversion systems at reasonable cost. The actual power and power density delivered by the thermoelectric generator, rather than ZT, is going to be the target metric in this study. The power density predicted for metal junctions TE will be greater than thermoelectrics with semiconductor junctions for the reasons given above.</p>* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI Biophysical Parameter Fields, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v2hq-pjgn) - The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data set and derived biophysical parameter fields were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. This multiple resolution (1/4, 1/2 and 1 degree in latitude and longitude) biophysical parameter data set contains essential variables for the calculation of photosynthesis, and the energy and water exchange between the Earth's surface (in particular of vegetation) and the lower boundary layer of the atmosphere. The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) is related to the light absorption and the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation. It also serves as an intermediate variable to calculate vegetation cover fraction (Vcover), total Leaf Area Index (LAI_T), green leaf area index (LAI_G), roughness length (z0), zero plane displacement (d), and snow-free albedo. The biophysical parameters were derived assuming one canopy layer. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.* [Polarimeter on a Chip: Antenna-Coupled Microbolometers and Polarimeters for Submillimeterwave and Millimeterwave Focal Planes, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/45hi-aeh4) - Future missions to study astrophysical sources at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths require focal planes of 1000's of detectors that must operate at the background limit from cooled telescopes in space, couple efficiently to optical systems spanning wavelengths from 1 cm to 0.1 mm, allow precise measurements of polarization, and interface with a suitable readout technology. These properties are critical, for example, for missions to decode completely the temperature and polarization of the 2.7 K cosmic microwave background radiation, such as the Einstein Inflation Probe (EIP, or CMBPol). Achieving these goals will require a revolution in detector technology, and scalable approaches that are compatible with planar microlithographic fabrication are therefore essential. The most promising schemes include antenna-coupled bolometers cooled to ~100 mK. We propose to develop the superconducting transition-edge hot-electron microbolometer (THM), which overcomes many of the limitations of current bolometer technology. Using superconducting transmission-line circuitry for focal-plane processing of the RF signal, we propose to integrate these detectors into a polarimeter on a single, monolithic circuit. The innovation directly addresses Topic 4 "Exploration of the Universe Beyond Our Solar System," subtopic S4.01 "Infrared and Sub-mm Sensors and Detectors."* [Low Power X-Ray Photon Resolving Imaging Array, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ydj9-q8qt) - Instruments employing X-ray detection are countless, in different sectors from medicine to industry and from basic to applied science. Given this importance, and despite existing technologies, there is still need for X-ray detection with increased system performance. The solid-state detector array is the primary technology to implement the current generation of space borne high-energy astronomy missions that are managed by NASA in partnership with the international community. Readout integrated circuitry (ROIC) specifically designed for photon resolving X-ray detection with solid-state detectors will create a new generation of high-performance X-ray imaging sensors. AC coupled detector input circuitry, similar to that used by Black Forest Engineering (BFE) for laser detection and ranging (LADAR), is ideally suited to NASA X-ray astronomy imaging system requirements. BFE proposes on Phase I to design, process and test detector input circuitry to meet a wide range of NASA X-ray imaging applications. The input circuit, when implemented into an ASIC X-ray imaging ROIC, manufactured and integrated with a solid-state detector array on Phase II, will provide single photon sensitivity, accurate X-ray energy determination, X-ray event time stamping, low power dissipation and ambient temperature operation.* [Autonomous Facility Health-Enabled Test Instrumentation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q34w-fdyf) - The combination of smart devices and embedded metadata and networked (wire and wireless) technologies present real opportunities for significant improvements in reliability, cost-benefits, and safety for remote testing, performance measurement, and facility management. Adding robust and autonomous network protocol for routing will further simplify testing installation process and increase test facility reliability.  However, the realization of a practical autonomous facility test system requires the synthesis of several technologies. One must bring together knowledge in the fields of sensors, data processing, distributed systems, and networks. Mobitrum proposes to develop "an autonomous facility health-enabled test instrumentation" for characterization and measurement of ground test facilities.  The proposed device includes: (1) facility health-enabled sensor, (2) signal conditioning and analog-to-digital (digital-to-analog) conversion, (3) microprocessor, (4) on-board memory (e.g., Flash or EEPROM) for metadata storage and executable software, and (5) embedded network interfaces to create a powerful, scalable, re-configurable, and reliable distributed test instrument. Autonomous facility health-enabled test instrumentation is built upon an open-system architecture with standardized protocol modules easily to interface with industry standards.* [Chip Integrated, Hybrid EHD/Capillary Driven Thermal Management System Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/iak3-sqer) - <p>Chip-Integrated, Hybrid EHD/Capillary-Driven Thermal Management System is a two year that will leverage independently attained yet related prototype hardware advances for electronics thermal management into a ground breaking hybrid thermal control system for spacecraft applications.</p><p>Objectives</p><ul><li>Design, fabricate, and validate the chip integrated hybrid EHD/capillary device</li><li>Quantify the reduction in required radiator area by utilizing chip integrated thermal management system (TMS)</li><li>Fabricate and validate in thermal vacuum environment the Chip Integrated Hybrid EHD/Capillary TMS</li></ul> <p>The proposed research will develop novel enabling thermal management technology addressing subsystem (on-board processing and electronics thermal management) as well as spacecraft level design.

Furthermore, processing capability is limited by thermal control considerations, such as the amount of heat rejected, the heat flux along the path of heat rejection, and the temperature difference between the electronics components and the thermal sink. Thus, technologists seek to integrate the thermal management solution directly into the chip layout, substrate structure, and/or package design. This will substantially boost the cooling performance, while introducing significant reduction in the package size, and requiring much smaller overall system temperature driving potential: a 3-D integrated solution that is lighter, more compact, and capable of greater heat transport. In addition, a two-phase device would provide thermal uniformity, reducing thermal stresses and thus enhancing overall component reliability. Functionally, this concept will reduce the thermal resistance between the chip and the radiator, raising the heat rejection temperature with little cost in power consumption. The net effect is to increase the available temperature for heat rejection, presenting the spacecraft with the advantages of increased power levels and/or reduced radiator mass and volume. The prototype TMS hardware will consist of an integrated heat sink chip embedded hybrid EHD/capillary-driven fluid management device that would ensure liquid supply and system self- regulation at the evaporative surfaces.<br />&nbsp;</p>* [Autonomous Systems: Autonomous Cryogenic Loading Operations](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qmdx-rzx5) - <p>Multi-center team will develop and demonstrate new, state-of-the-art control architecture that enables next generation of health management techniques, intelligent devices and autonomous control technologies to perform autonomous control of a cryogenic propellant loading system.</p> <p>The main objectives are to develop and integrate Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) tools and component technologies into a seamless health management architecture and to create an autonomous cryogenic loading capability.

It also addresses the need for multiple sensing points with minimum tank or bulkhead feedthroughs. The proposed innovations will increase the response speed of reported hydrogen sensors by a factor of 5 and the sensitivity by a factor of 10. In the Phase I feasibility work, it is proposed to demonstrate these attributes for single sensors.  In Phase II, the multiplexing, detection reliability and special packaging necessary to make the sensors practical for NASA and other applications will be demonstrated in preparation for commercialization in Phase III.* [Optical Sensors for Hydrogen and Oxygen for Unambiguous Detection in Their Mutual Presence, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jqzt-bgh4) - The objective of the Phase I SBIR project is to develop sensors that can discriminate the presence of combustible gases like oxygen (O2) in hydrogen (H2) or H2 in O2 backgrounds. These sensors will meet NASA applications for on-orbit crew and mission safety. Currently, H2 and O2 are produced by electrolysis of water. The O2 is used in the environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) of spacecraft while the hydrogen is vented. H2 is a flammable gas while oxygen aids in combustion. InnoSense LLC (ISL) will utilize its Chemical Fingerprint (TM) sensor array fabrication technology in Phase I to engineer a miniature device with multi-analyte detection capability. The Phase I working model would be evaluated to demonstrate NASA use potential. Upon fine-tuning various parameters in Phase II, the system performance will be tested with a prototype hardware.  ISL has received technology endorsement letter from a prime contractor in the NASA application area.  For assuring success of this project, ISL has assembled a technical team with a cumulative 60 person-years of experience in developing commercially viable sensor systems.* [Micromechanical Models for Composite NDE and Diagnostics, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ada3-i9hs) - Modern aircraft (and next generation spacecraft) increasingly rely on composite components due to their excellent specific strength and stiffness, as well as improvements in costs and manufacturing quality.  However, life management for composites is in its infancy compared to life management for metal structures.  Limitations in the ability of standard nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods to observe manufacturing quality and in-service damage evolution of composite structures may prevent designers from realizing their full potential.  Current NDE practices are incapable of overcoming these limitations.  Thus, a new framework and methodology is needed for high resolution imaging and tracking of manufacturing quality and damage evolution.

The goal of this program is to enable assessment of the matrix, fiber, and bonding conditions for composites using a combination of detailed physics-based models, high resolution imaging, and controlled loading sources to isolate the composite characteristic of interest.  Micromechanical models allow quantitative determination of composite constituent properties.  This program focuses on magnetic field sensing (i.e., eddy-current) methods that can be combined with structural analysis to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of these NDE methods.  JENTEK and MR&D are well-positioned to deliver this methodology in the form of commercial software and NDE equipment.  We will also work with a major aircraft OEM to maintain our focus on practical solutions to high priority needs.* [Rapid Concentration for Improved Detection of Microbes in ISS Potable Water, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/afkz-jkxi) - Providing a reliable supply of safe drinking water is a critical requirement for space exploration. Systems that provide recycled, treated water aboard the International Space Station, & that will supply water aboard future spacecraft, are inherently complex and can be susceptible to biofilm formation and microbial contamination.  Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments. These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, make rapid & reliable methods of detecting microbes at low levels a critical need.

Rapid microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour. Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample concentration techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in drinking water. Currently, without sample concentration, rapid detection techniques alone produce results that are hundreds to thousands of times less sensitive than the minimum desired detection limit for microbial water contaminates.

InnovaPrep proposes development of a rapid microbial concentration system designed for use aboard the International Space Station. The system will concentrate microbes from up to 5 Liters of potable water into volumes as small as 200 &#956;L &#150; providing concentration factors as high as 15,000X.  It will be based on technologies developed and commercialized by InnovaPrep, but will contain innovations to allow for operation in microgravity. Large volumes of potable water are processed through a hollow fiber membrane filter concentration cell as microbes are captured within the lumen of the fibers. Following capture, the microbes are efficiently eluted using a novel Wet Foam Elution process and then delivered to a rapid detection system for analysis.* [Intelligent Agents for Improved Ground-Test Operations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s7je-heg4) - The proposal outlines a research program for developing a novel soft-computing technology composed of an Artificial Immune System and Bayesian Belief Networks for monitoring, knowledge and information processing, and decision support infrastructure for testing of rocket engines of future spacecrafts. An engine failure during test operations may cause catastrophic results for the test article, supporting infrastructure, and potentially to supporting resources. The ability to effectively monitor health and status of a testbed and test article during a test firing and to take corrective measures for peak performance and improving reliable operations is of utmost importance. Using an existing SR-30 Jet Engine testbed utilizing artificial intelligence control techniques, novel algorithms are being developed by The University of Alabama that can function under faulty sensor conditions, can work effectively with thousands of sensors at high data rates, are self-checking, and are self-correcting can be of further support. The proposed effort builds on an existing joint MSFC/University of Alabama project where NASA's NSSTC is only funding graduate student research. This proposal will further enhance technology research for realization and synthesis of needed advanced algorithms in larger scale test platforms for propulsion health management, thereby furthering educational research addressing NASA's education missions.* [Portable Programmable Multifunction Body Fluids Analyzer, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/acp5-amss) - Advanced Liquid Logic proposes to develop a very capable analyzer based on its digital microfluidic technology. Such an analyzer would be:

&#61656;	Capable of both simple and complex biological assays
&#61656;	Small, lightweight, power efficient, and easy to operate
&#61656;	Fully programmable and remotely reprogrammable

Under NIH funding we have demonstrated clinical chemistry blood diagnostic testing on our lab-on-a-chip platform. Our vision is to develop a portable diagnostic analyzer that performs the same tests as central lab-based analytical equipment with even broader functionality by integrating hematology, pathology, molecular diagnostics, cytology, microbiology, and serology onto the same platform.  These diverse tests would be multiplexed to use the same very small body fluid or solid sample. We believe that digital microfluidics is uniquely capable of meeting NASA's requirements because:

&#61656;	We will be able to address a larger breadth of tests than conventional microfluidics on even smaller sample volumes
&#61656;	Our technology miniaturizes both the assay and the associated equipment 
&#61656;	Our droplet-based technology provides positive control of each droplet 
&#61656;	Our lab-on-a-chip can be designed for multiple uses, reducing or eliminating the need for disposable components
&#61656;	Our platform could be integrated with implanted or automated minimally invasive sample extraction techniques* [NACP Regional: Original Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dvpp-4eft) - This data set contains the originally-submitted observation measurement data, terrestrial biosphere model output data, and inverse model simulations that various investigator teams contributed to the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis activities. The data set provides nine (9) data packages of remote sensing and ground observation measurements (OM) (MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP), MODIS net primary production (NPP), MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPar), MODIS leaf area index (LAI), MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), MODIS normalize difference vegetation index (NDVI), Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) forest biomass, National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) crop NPP, and Flux Anomaly). The data set also provides data packages of simulation results from 19 terrestrial biosphere models (TBM) and eight (8) inverse models (IM). The data packages are respectively OM, TBM, and IM data files listed in Tables 4-6. Each OM, TBM, and IM data package contains all of the original data (and documentation, if any) that the NACP Modeling and Synthesis Thematic Data Center (MAST-DC) acquired or received. These originally-submitted data were processed by the MAST-DC to produce the three standardized gridded data sets of carbon flux for inter-comparison purposes (see Related Data Products below). These original data and documentation are provided to allow users of the standardized gridded data products to be able to trace back to the data origins when needed. The Data Center (ORNL DAAC) transformed some of the originally-submitted data files to file formats that are more suitable for long-term archiving. For example, *.xlsx files were saved as *.csv, ERDAS Imagine files were converted to GeoTIFFs, and MATLAB files were converted to GeoTIFF and NetCDF formats as appropriate.

Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) and Hybrid Electric architectures rely heavily on batteries to achieve fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions.  DEP Aircraft of the future have demands for Energy Storage Systems with large counts of cells put in series and parallel to achieve needed voltage and energy levels.  The X57 Maxwell Battery comprises of over 6000 cells. As the pack goes through repeated charge/discharge cycles, as well as environmental cycles, each individual cell begins to lose its capacity.  Cell to cell capacity variation causes the entire pack to limited by the weakest cell. Traditional Passive Balancing topologies are limited in their ability to address cell mismatch on the discharge cycle.  Active balancing allows a dynamic measurement & control system to discharge cells at variable rates. With a more robust measurement & control architecture, Active topologies have the ability to integrate more advanced algorithms. These algorithms include predictive health monitoring, life based management, physics based cell modelling.  Batteries can last longer, avoid thermal runaway, and avoid maintenance.  EPS is proposing development of an active BMS concept, with associated algorithms to achieve a 40% life improvement on the X57 pack.* [Electro-Kinetic Ice Gun for Frozen Ice Plume Simulations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g6cd-ki4t) - This proposal evolved as a result of a conversation with a NASA scientist regarding plans for a mission to Europa to seek signs of life based on observed water plume emissions. With Jupiter as a bright light behind the moon, NASA was able to observe Europa in silhouette, and with ultraviolet light saw what appeared to be evidence of the plumes. If plumes exist, this is an exciting find, lead researcher William Sparks said. It means we may be able to explore that ocean, that ocean of Europa, and for organic chemicals, he added. It would allow us to search for signs of life without having to drill through miles of ice. The apparent plumes seem to be mostly around the south pole, Sparks said, although one appears farther north and may be a likelier candidate for a mission. "We presume it to be water vapor or ice particles because that's what Europa's made of, and those molecules do appear at the wavelengths we observed.
In preparation for such a mission, spacecraft will have to pass through dense clouds of ice particulates, which could damage vital instruments. Accordingly, NASA has indicated there is a need for simulating the production of ice in the size range of 50nm up through 2 microns. The NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range was designed to sent solid projectiles for studying the effects of meteorite impacts on celestial bodies and potential micro-meteoroid damage to spacecraft. At the far end of the barrel, a gunpowder explosion is used to compress hydrogen gas to as much as 1 million times atmospheric pressure. The compressed gas gets released and sent down the launch tube, firing a projectile pellet at speeds between 7,000 and 15,000 mph.  No ice particulate could survive being subjected to such massive transitory input of kinetic energy. The Ames gun was not designed for accelerating ice projectiles, so a new technology is required. Here is proposed an electrospray ice plume generator, with electrostatic acceleration.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2nji-q2mq) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [GPM SAPHIR on MT1 (PRPS) Radiometer Precipitation Profiling L2A 1.5 hours 10 km V05 (GPM_2APRPSMT1SAPHIR) at GES DISC](https://data.nasa.gov/d/trr5-sxps) - The Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate
of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence
of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation
retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals
from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial
coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument
are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.

Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the
retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and
index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information,
unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is
advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model
data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).

The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution
(regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation
estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database
provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.* [CERES Bidirectional Scans Terra FM2 Edition1-CV](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vqst-p4pn) - CER_BDS_Terra-FM2_Edition1-CV data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.

In this Phase I award, Impact Technologies, in collaboration with GE Aviation, will develop a fault-tolerant smart transducer node through a Distributed Engine Control Simulator (DECSim) design tool that will utilize a commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) open-system communications standard and will interface with the C-MAPSS engine model.  In Phase I, Impact will successfully develop: i) the DECSim utility, ii) the smart node self-validation and cross-validation capabilities, iii) the overall distributed control architecture, and iv) the firmware code that will reside on hardware.  At the end of the Phase I program, Impact will demonstrate the functionality of a candidate DEC smart node in hardware within the DECSim framework.  The final smart node technology will alleviate the severe system-level limitations of current centralized architectures that include a large weight imposition, limited design flexibility, and life cycle cost burdens associated with certification and obsolescence management.* [Hall-Effect Thruster Modifications for Dual-Mode Electric Propulsion, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ccf2-f3d6) - The integrated NASA/DoD electric propulsion objectives are for a
specific mass less than 3 kg/kW while demonstrating a throttlable
thrust-to-power ratio of 100:1 at a specific impulse of 1,000 sec down
to 40:1 at 4,000 sec with an operational lifetime exceeding 20,000
hours.  Modern Hall-effect thrusters (HETs) are a proven technology with
flight heritage, established manufacturing readiness and testing
channels that nearly meet the desired specifications (as shown in Figure
1).  However, the major limitation is that HETs fail to achieve all four
of objectives simultaneously. This Phase I feasibility study is focused
on a proof-of-concept experiment to alleviate the HET dual-mode
operational envelope limitation for both high thrust-to-power and high
specific impulse.   Starfire Industries believes that a &quot;low
hanging fruit&quot; modification to HETs exists, and such an improvement
would be evolutionary to enable multi-mission EP systems for NASA's
Science Mission Directorate and DoD platforms.  Towards this end,
Starfire has partnered with Aerojet Corporation to rapidly demonstrate
feasibility in Phase I through experimental modification to an existing
HET system.  If results are confirmed, a Phase II design can be driven
to yield immediate upgrades for flight-qualified HET systems for
near-term payback.* [TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) Level 1 Raw and Calibrated Radiance Products (TRMM Product 1A11) V7](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tmvk-xx27) - The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation and to estimate its associated latent heating. TRMM was successfully launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.

The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a nine-channel passive microwave radiometer, which builds on the heritage of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument flown aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. Microwave radiation is emitted by the Earth's surface and by water droplets within clouds. However, when layers of large ice particles are present in upper cloud regions - a condition highly correlated with heavy rainfall - microwave radiation tends to scatter at frequencies above 19 GHz. The TMI detects radiation at five frequencies chosen to discriminate among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood of rainfall. The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by this method is the deduction of cloud precipitation consistent with the radiation measurement at each frequency. The TMI frequencies are 10.65, 19.35, 37 and 85.5 GHz (dual polarization), and 21 GHz (vertical polarization only).

The Level 1A product file (1A11) is a concatenation of the Level 0 data with a header record and, as such, is reversible to Level 0. The header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbit number, times of the first scan and number of scans, among other things. The Level 0 data contain the actual channel data expressed as "sensor counts." A file contains data for a single orbit with a file size of about 7 MB (uncompressed).  There are 16 files of TMI 1A11 data produced per day.

Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.

TRMM V6 vs. V7 Major Data Format Changes: http://pps.gsfc.nasa.gov/Documents/formatChangesV7.pdf* [Sealing Technologies for Repetitive Use in Abrasive, Electrostatic, High Vacuum Environments, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4vba-8yjj) - Clearly, the presence of lunar dust has the propensity for major adverse impacts on dynamic mechanical systems required for future lunar operations such as Rovers, Robotic Systems, In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) and science experiments. As such, the development of innovative techniques for mitigating dust affects is warranted. In abrasive environments such as the presence of regolith dust on the moon, mechanism seals must be either designed for robustness to avoid premature damage and leakage, or, the dust particles must be removed. For this SBIR, Starsys proposes an enabling all-metal, knife-edge seal capable of maintaining seal integrity even in the presence of the abrasive, lunar dust. The proposed Knife Edge Seal concept provides for an innovative mechanism by which to seal critical ISRU mechanisms even in the presence of lunar dust contamination. Starsys' knife edge seal approach will utilize a hard metal knife edge and seal gland filled with an Indium alloy. The knife edge geometry is sized to allow for low forces required to penetrate the Indium, while the gland geometry is sized to properly and reliably capture the Indium. The Indium is a phase change material available in a variety of alloys to target specific melting points. 

The Knife Edge Seal offers two distinct advantages when attempting to mitigate the affects of lunar dust; 1) the knife edge will penetrate any dust layer developed on the seal gland surface and embed itself into the gland material, and 2) the Indium can be heated and re-flowed in between mate and de-mate cycles, allowing the dust particles to mix in with the soft Indium material and most likely eliminating sufficient barrier between the knife edge and Indium to allow for sufficient sealing to occur.* [SMEX03 ThetaProbe Soil Moisture Data: Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6uzm-2kqy) - This data set includes soil moisture data measured with Delta-T Devices ThetaProbe ML2 sensors for the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03), conducted during June and July 2003 in northern Alabama and southern Tennessee, USA.

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under settled or partially settled conditions, various mass-gauging techniques are under development. However, these techniques require installation of hardware inside the tank which is undesirable.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; In microgravity (unsettled) conditions, both the location and shape of the ullage are <em>a priori </em>unknown. Presently, there are no technological solutions capable of determining the volume of unsettled liquid propellant for arbitrary ullage shapes in a tank<sup>1</sup> to within a few per cent accuracy as required for deep space NASA missions.<sup>2-3</sup></p>

<p>The proposed approach aims to overcome the two major limitations of the present technologies: (1) the need of installation of hardware inside the tank; (2) assumption of particular ullage shape. In addition, the approach is (3) applicable to both conducting (MMH) and non-conducting liquids (LOx, LH2) (in contrast to RFMG approach); (4) based on different physical principles from the existing approaches, therefore enabling the required redundancy in mass-gauging in&nbsp; those cases (settled or partially settled liquids), where alternative approaches are satisfactory.</p>
 <p>Overall Concept: Spectral Mass-gauging (SMG) &ndash; computes propellant volume using the acoustic resonances counting function in the propellant tank; it is based on rigorous results from spectral theory (Weyl&rsquo;s Law), providing a shape-invariant spectral characteristics4. Weyl&rsquo;s law provides a rigorous tool to infer the volume of the liquid in partially filled tanks: (i) for arbitrary shapes of the ullage, (ii) systematically controlling accuracy, limited only by the acoustic dissipation, which is found to be very low in space applications and allows reaching theoretical limit of fractions of percent of the tank volume. While Weyl&rsquo;s law is well-known in mathematical community and has been tested in fundamental research5, it has never been applied to acoustic mass-gauging of liquids in space applications, where it offers big promise due to the large dimensions of the tanks; nature of the fluid (liquid) and character of the boundary conditions (vacuum).</p>* [Spatial Heterodyne Spectrometer for Aviation Hazard Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ubk3-ut3a) - Physical Sciences Inc (PSI) proposes the development of a longwave infrared (LWIR) imaging spatial heterodyne spectrometer (I-SHS) for standoff detection of clear air turbulence (CAT) and wake vortices from an airborne platform.  PSI will team with Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) who has produced significant research on the application of LWIR hyperspectral imaging for detection of these and other air hazards.  The research has produced extensive simulations, however, the predicted spectral radiance signatures are an order of magnitude below the noise floor of state of the art in LWIR hyperspectral imagers.  The proposed LWIR I-SHS will offer this order of magnitude improvement in noise equivalent spectral radiance through a combination of high throughput and minimal noise-inducing sampling errors owing to the stationary interferometer.  A preliminary systems analysis predicts a per-pixel NESR of 1E-9 W/(cm^2 ster cm^-1) at 16 cm^-1 spectral resolution.  

In Phase I, PSI will formalize a system performance model and will produce and characterize a breadboard I-SHS which will be used to demonstrate a molecular imaging measurement as a surrogate for a wake vortex.  With the support of GTRI, PSI will generate requirements and a conceptual design for a TRL 5 system to be developed in Phase II.* [Real-Time Fault Contingency Management for Integrated Vehicle Health Management, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yv2n-erq4) - Impact Technologies, with support from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Honeywell, propose to develop and demonstrate a suite of real-time Fault Contingency Management (FCM) algorithms for application within an Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) system. The proposed FCM software will implement a novel vehicle subsystem fault accommodation approach based on a seamless integration between real-time system health identification and adaptive controller techniques.  Specifically, the continuous health assessment algorithms include a real-time adaptive recursive system identification algorithm and an enhanced real-time moving horizon estimation (MHE) algorithm that will be developed and implemented on a prototype embedded system. 

The proposed FCM software hierarchy will act from the subsystems level up through the vehicle level and will implement fault-accommodating control, health management, and contingency management to accomplish its goal. The significant technology advancement proposed herein is based on the use of dynamic simulation models in a real-time computing environment to not only update health status predictions, but also to determine "on the fly" how accommodate for them.  At the conclusion of Phase I, the project team will deliver a proof-of-concept demonstration of the proposed techniques running on an embedded platform using high fidelity propulsion and aircraft simulation models.* [A Novel Technology for Simultaneous TOC Reduction and Biofouling Prevention, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dazf-46eb) - Long-duration space missions such as the upcoming Moon and Mars missions require reliable systems for the preparation of potable water through efficient recycling, and prevention of biofilm growth on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and water lines.  Lynntech, Inc. proposes a novel technology to simultaneously reduce the total organic carbon (TOC) content of biological water processor (BWP) processed water, and control biofilm formation on water lines, surfaces and membranes within the water reclamation unit utilized on board spacecraft and within future planetary habitats.  This technology is based on Lynntech's proprietary electrochemical on demand oxidizer generator, which does not require consumable chemicals. The on-demand produced oxidizer can be added to the primary processed water from the BWP unit.  Using this innovative approach in the form of a compact TOC and microbial count (MC) reduction module which will be situated in line with the BWP unit, Lynntech aims to achieve an order of magnitude reduction in the TOC content within the BWP processed water.  The residual oxidizer/disinfectant and reduced TOC will prevent the formation of biofilms on the RO membrane and water lines and will reduce the equivalent system mass by lowering the load on equipment downstream to the BWP, enabling a reduction in their size and weight.  Phase I work will concentrate on providing proof-of-concept for the technology while Phase II will involve the fabrication of a prototype TOC and MC reduction module and its integration with the Integrated Advanced Water Recovery Test System operational at NASA-JSC.* [Robust Optimal Fragmentation and Dispersion of Near-Earth Objects](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v5gs-qqib) - <p>During the past 2 decades, various concepts for mitigating the impact threats from NEOs have been proposed, but many of these concepts were impractical and not technically credible. In particular, all non-nuclear techniques require mission lead times larger than 10 years. However, for the most probable impact threat with a warning time less than 10 years, the use of high-energy nuclear explosives in space becomes inevitable for proper fragmentation and dispersion of an NEO in a collision course with Earth. However, the existing nuclear subsurface penetrator technology limits the impact velocity to less than 300m/s because higher impact velocities destroy prematurely the detonation electronic equipment. Thus, an innovative space system architecture utilizing high-energy nuclear explosives must be developed for a worst-case intercept mission resulting in relative closing velocities as high as 5-30km/s. An advanced system concept is proposed for nuclear subsurface explosion missions. The concept blends a hypervelocity kinetic-energy impactor with nuclear subsurface explosion, and exploits a 2-body space vehicle consisting of a fore body and an aft body. These 2 spacecraft bodies may be connected by a deployable boom. The fore body provides proper kinetic impact crater conditions for an aft body carrying nuclear explosives to make a deeper penetration into an asteroid body. For such a complex mission architecture design study, non-traditional, multidisciplinary research efforts in the areas of hypervelocity impact dynamics, nuclear explosion modeling, high-temperature thermal shielding, shock-resistant electronic systems, and advanced space system technologies are required. Expanding upon the current research activities, the Iowa State Asteroid Deflection Research Center will develop an innovative, advanced space system architecture that provides the planetary defense capabilities needed to enable a future real space mission more efficient, affordable, and reliable.</p>* [An Optical Wake Vortex Detection System for Super-Density Airport Operation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bhxi-t6ia) - OSI proposes to develop a wake vortex detection system including a group of double-ended and single-ended optical scintillometers properly deployed in the airfield to measure ground and near ground crosswind, turbulence, and wake vortex using atmospheric turbulence-induced optical scintillations. As part of efforts, OSI also proposes to develop a single-ended optical scintillometer, together with a retro-reflector, for the measurement of near ground real-time crosswind and wake vortex. OSI will perform system analysis and design of the proposed system to detect occurrences, location, magnitude, and persistence of wake turbulence. With the simultaneous measurements of crosswind and turbulence, the sensor system is also able to forecast the arrival time of the airplane generated wake vortex drifting to a nearby runway.

In the Phase I effort, OSI will determine the optimum siting criteria of deploying the double-ended and single-ended sensors on the airport. This includes combinations of parallel to runway, cross the runway, and retro-reflector on high towers installations. The goal is to form a network of sensors to cover essential areas of airport field to provide wake vortex data for the predictive modeling of wake vortex hazard. 

As a side benefit, the vortex detection system could measure downdraft by deploying two sets of scintillometers on both sides of the runway. The line-averaged crosswind measured by the two sets will provide real-time continuous measurements of convergence and divergence of the wind field between the two optical paths. Vertical winds, and hence the downdraft, can be derived from the measured divergence. The proposed vortex detection system will also be able to provide critical large area wind information. By incorporating this valuable information into the low-level wind shear modeling, it will greatly enhance the performance of the present airport low-level wind shear systems.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Population](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7cx4-bfp8) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Population data sets provide baseline population information as one of the drivers of ecosystem change.

These observatories allow us to collect more light and extend angular resolution to detect fainter objects in the cosmos. While ground-based telescopes are fundamentally limited by atmospheric distortion and absorption, space-based telescopes avoid these disadvantages but introduce new challenges. The aperture size of a space-telescope is driven by scientific requirements for resolution and sensitivity, but it is constrained by the capabilities of launch vehicles. Segmented apertures relax some of the volume constraint, but a natural question is whether the primary should be a single large foldable mirror structure (like James Webb Space Telescope), or a modular structure suitable for in-space robotic assembly. The second option, which will be investigated in this research, overcomes volume and mass limitations of a single launch vehicle, allowing telescope components to be launched incrementally.

The goal of my research project is to provide ground-breaking designs for modular, ultra-light, and precision space structures, suitable for the development of extremely large optical reflectors (i.e. 10 m and above) that are robotically assembled in space. There are three main advantages related to this proposed approach: first, substantially reducing the cost of building large space optical reflectors by developing new and less expensive solutions, second, implementing a lightweight technology by utilizing ultra-thin composite materials, and third, increasing system redundancy by adopting an architecture that consists of separate modules that can be replaced.

There are many steps involved in the design of innovative structures. Here, I identify the four main tasks required to complete the proposed research: numerical simulations, material characterization, composite manufacturing, and testing and validation. Numerical simulations will help identify optimal design configurations and predict possible failure modes of the modular unit. Material characterization will be necessary to study the viscoelastic effects of long-term storage. Finally, manufacturing and testing of the modules will complete the design process and help find solutions.

The modular unit promises to meet NASA's requirements for packaging-efficient, lightweight, low-cost, reliable, and precision structures, by incorporating established techniques and ground-breaking approaches. The success of this project will help in achieving NASA's goals for future space exploration by developing low technology readiness concepts and enabling large space-based observatories.* [A Miniature Multimodal Imaging System for Medical Diagnostics and Interventions in Space](https://data.nasa.gov/d/werm-8xkg) - Long-term health of astronauts in space relies on effective in-situ diagnoses, management and interventions. However, clinicians are not always present during space exploration. Furthermore, the constraints of space travel make it difficult to bring large scanners such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) to space. Ultrasound is small and compatible with space exploration. However, ultrasound suffers from a small field of view, and ultrasound images are not easily correlated with anatomical structures, making it difficult to use for astronauts. Recently, significant efforts have been directed towards optical modalities, such as fluorescence imaging, due to their high sensitivity and small size. Miniature imaging systems that can combine the advantages of several modalities will be beneficial for clinical use in space. For effective deployment in space, an imaging system must be accurate, small, safe and easy to use, providing for in-situ diagnosis and treatment assistance.

To facilitate long-term health management in space, we propose to develop a prototype miniature multimodal imaging goggle device for guiding medical examinations and interventions during space exploration. We will adapt the imaging goggle concept for aerospace use and expand the present goggle system by integrating multiple imaging modalities, including pre-flight MRI and real-time ultrasound, with the goggle. The 3D multimodal images will be processed, co-registered and displayed in the goggle eyepieces in real-time. The project will be guided by three specific aims: (1) develop a prototype goggle device that can offer fluorescence imaging and wireless communication capacity, (2) integrate MRI and ultrasound with fluorescence imaging, and (3) use multimodal imaging goggle to guide medical examinations and interventions by first responders.

With the versatile multimodal imaging goggle at astronauts disposal, wide arrays of medical procedures in space can be enabled. Local and space-earth collaborations can be established to guide various procedures. Minimal medical training will be needed for operating the system owing to its user-friendliness. The proposed multimodal goggle will revolutionize long-duration health management by enabling astronauts to perform complex image-guided examinations and interventions in space.

The proposed academic and research program will offer me comprehensive training in aerospace-related bioengineering research, which bridges the gap between medicine and space. I will have opportunities for training in a new research setting that involves multiple disciplines, including medical imaging, aerospace engineering, optical instrumentation, emergency clinical care and translational research.  Such experience will not only augment my expertise in biomedical and aerospace instrumentation but also will enhance my vision in interdisciplinary innovative research. Utilizing close collaborations with top aerospace technology researchers and clinicians, I will be able to integrate my capacity in bioengineering with my knowledge in aerospace technology to solve clinical challenges in space.  The visiting technologist experience will further sharpen my perception in long-duration health management from an aerospace perspective. Furthermore, the collaborative nature of the proposed training will inspire me to develop management and leadership skills, which will greatly benefit my future career as a researcher who leads a multidisciplinary team solving aerospace-related bioengineering problems.* [Tractor Beams for Optical Micromanipulation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/r7yq-t9dq) - This proposal seeks support to develop methods to project propagation-invariant electromagnetic fields that can transport illuminated objects upstream against the direction of energy flow over large distances. Such fields constitute practical realizations of "tractor beams" that have long been the subject of speculation, and could find wide-ranging applications in space and planetary exploration. Among their applications, laser-based tractor beams are potentially suitable for sampling dust from comet tails and planet surfaces. Relative to mechanical systems, tractor beams offer substantially longer ranges, far fewer moving parts, and nondestructive manipulation of delicate samples. While optical tractor beams are currently classified as technology readiness level (TRL) 1, we are here proposing to advance the technology to TRL 3. In order to achieve this goal, the Principal Investigator will employ a combination of theoretical research, computer modeling, and experimental verification, with emphasis on two promising realizations of optical tractors beams: solenoid beams and optical conveyors. In particular, we will explore a novel method of hologram projection, here termed Intermediate Plane Holographic Optical Trapping (iHOT). In this technique, holograms are projected by modulating the phase of an intermediate plane in a 4-f projection system, instead of the back-focal-plane. We anticipate that iHOT will circumvent hardware limitations within the present implementation that have restricted the complexity and range of tractor beams. Furthermore, we will examine the origin of the experimentally measured optical forces on micrometer-scale colloidal and aerosol particles, enabling us to optimize the tractor beam performance. Additionally, we will apply our knowledge of long-range optical tractor beams to the microwave regime by manipulating the phase with a micromirror array.* [SMEX03 ALMNet and SCAN Soil Moisture Data: Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/m9d5-u7w4) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC.

different voltage levels.  It is, however, important to interface,
maintain, and update these systems.  For example, the Sun Earth
Connection (SEC) missions are likely to have a variety of experiments
needing to be accomplished with a single nanosatellite. A rad-hard
reconfigurable bi-directional level shifters would allow them to
accomplish this goal despite the various multi-voltage level systems
employed within the satellite.  Additionally, a level shifter could be
used to extend and/or expand the life of existing space systems.
Presently and in the future, nanosatellites and other spacecraft have
need for rad-hard reconfigurable bi-directional level shifters to enable
there existing systems the ability to communicate logic signals to other
lower voltage level systems.  This proposal is to develop such a level
shifter.   This will allow these systems to continue to conduct
operations and missions for the existing and a growing number of future
users.  Space system applications for SEC missions have mass, power,
cost, and rad-hard limitations on all of their circuits.  A rad-hard
reconfigurable bi-directional level shifter design would provide for
these needs between multilevel voltage technologies to aid in their missions.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Time Average 1-hourly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3md3-d44d) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

The Quantum Dot Spectrum Converter (QDSC) disperses quantum dots into the transparent silicone layer that normally functions as coverglass adhesive. The Quantum Dots (QD) act as a fluorescent spectrum converter for solar cells, to allow the use of the 20-50% of the solar spectrum unavailable to today's highest efficiency solar cells. By selecting QD's of particular compositions and sizes, we customize absorption and emission spectra to down-convert UV photons, including multiple exciton generation, and up-convert IR photons in a multiple photon process. This approach overcomes the fundamental 'red-loss' and 'blue-loss' limitations, allowing more efficiency from conventional single- and multi-bandgap photovoltaic devices. We also explore the use of a QDSC in a non-tracking fluorescent concentrator for enhancing flux and shielding for solar cells and in thermophotovoltaic systems as a means of enhancing efficiency while eliminating selective emitters. These approaches address the topic need for significantly improved efficiency and radiation hardening for deep space missions ? the QDSC can significantly enhance conversion efficiency of qualified, high-efficiency cells, while its implementation in a luminescent or thermophotovoltaic concentrator allows solar cells to be shielded from adverse radiation and thermal environments.* [NACP MsTMIP: Global and North American Driver Data for Multi-Model Intercomparison](https://data.nasa.gov/d/refm-6t2f) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides environmental data that have been standardized and aggregated for use as input to carbon cycle models at global (0.5-degree resolution) and regional (North America at 0.25-degree resolution) scales.

The temporal ranges of the data are sufficient for carbon cycle model simulations from 1801 to 2010. These data were compiled specifically for the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Multi-Scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) as the prescribed model input driver data (Huntzinger et al., 2013). The driver data were used by 22 terrestrial biosphere models to run baseline and sensitivity simulations. The standardized data provided consistent model inputs to minimize the inter-model variability caused by differences in environmental drivers and initial conditions. Together with the sensitivity simulations, the standardized input data enable better interpretation and quantification of structural and parameter uncertainties of model estimates. Data are provided in Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata convention compliant (version 1.4) netCDF-4 file formats.

Our novel sensor technology offers a number of advantages including compactness, lightweight, low power consumption, and high sensitivity.  We achieve this by fabricating Bragg gratings on stress-wave-sensitive polymer planar waveguides, which is capable of detecting both surface and below surface cracks and stress in aerospace structures.  In Phase I, using a guided wave method we will demonstrate the polymer gratings' capability to measure strain and stress waves indicating the presence and severity of damages caused by cracks, disbonding, or corrosion in a thin metal structure, when the structure is probed by a conventional  ultrasonic wave generation device. In Phase II, an integrated optic Bragg grating-based load monitoring and guided wave sensor prototype and a crack detection algorithm will be developed to provide structural health monitoring and nondestructive evaluation for spacecraft composite systems and components.* [SAFARI 2000 AVHRR Daily Site (1.5 km) and 15-Day Regional (1.5- and 6-km) Imagery](https://data.nasa.gov/d/x83t-yg6f) - The Global Inventory Mapping and Modeling (GIMMS) group at NASA/GSFC provided SAFARI 2000 with remotely sensed satellite data products at the site and regional level.

These PGWs leave a signature on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) called the primordial "B-modes." The quest for detection of this signature has launched substantial technological development because this signal is predicted to be one part in a billion of the unpolarized signal.

The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a ground based telescope array which will measure the polarization of the CMB to unprecedented accuracy. This measurement will require the development of several technologies which will be required for the possible space mission outlined in the Epoch of Inflation Technology push. CLASS will be an important test-bed for these technologies and will raise the technology readiness level of several relevant instruments.

CLASS will use extremely sensitive antenna-coupled transition edge sensors and a rapid front-end polarization modulator to make a multifrequency measurement of the polarized CMB on the largest angular scales. By searching for the predicted peak in the primordial B-mode power spectrum, CLASS will detect the PGW signature if the tensor to scalar ratio is greater than 0.01.

A detection of primordial gravitational waves from the epoch of inflation would have transformative effects on the field of cosmology. The technological advances made through the development of CLASS could achieve this detection while simultaneously raising the technology readiness level for future missions.* [A Novel Microfluidic Device for Fully Automated Extraction of RNA from Cell Cultures, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/94qm-7vfw) - Obtaining high quality, intact RNA from cells is an ubiquitous need in the pursuit of space biology. Our overall objective is to develop and commercialize a microfluidics based miniaturized platform (MED-RNA) that can fully automate the complex process of RNA isolation. Starting from harvested whole mammalian cells in a culture medium, MED-RNA will lyse, capture, and isolate RNA content for later analysis, in a fully integrated fashion with minimal user intervention. In addition to higher yields and faster process times, losses and contamination will be minimized as a result of the miniaturization and automation. A novel and unique plastic card based fabrication technology from Micronics Corp. will be leveraged for low-cost microfabrication. 

The Phase I study successfully demonstrated concept development and design of three critical aspects of the MED-RNA, (1) on-card reagent based cell lysis, (2) non-toxic electric field driven cell lysis, and (3) RNA capture and elution in a microfluidic extraction chamber. Physical prototypes of the components were fabricated and experimentally demonstrated. During Phase II, we will further optimize the individual component designs. Optimal components, along with necessary valving will be integrated on a plastic, microfluidic lab card. The fully integrated prototype lab card will be demonstrated on chosen cell lines.

This digital alloy InAsSb material system is capable of infrared detection between 0.4-5 um, depending on layer thickness of the period of each digital ultra thin superlattice. The goal of this program is to develop InAsSb-based FPA for 0.4-5 um detection at room temperature. Photo detector arrays using this material are of great interest to the NASA for various applications including, in particular, imaging and optical detection, and object discrimination when tracking targets in space or performing astronomical observations. These MWIR photo detectors can also find application to infrared-based chemical identification systems and terrestrial mapping. Applying the dark current suppression and cutoff wavelength extension process to the InAsSb-based detectors should result in higher operating temperature, extended cutoff wavelength, and radiation-hard devices, all important factors that should significantly enhance FPA operation.  We intend to characterize the positive effects of proposed techniques in Phase I.  In Phase II we will refine the techniques to realize high-performance MWIR FPAs operating at ambient temperatures.* [Transcription profiling of mouse osteoblasts under static vs simulated microgravity](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ytn6-338w) - The below table includes a smaller list of data that was analyzed by dChip and filtered by pvalue such that a file with about 4600 genes was obtained which allowed for ease of use from 40,000 genes.

The RNA was then sent to Affymetrix microarray core facility at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston TX) for microarray analysis.* [Liquid Crystal Elastomer Membranes and the Wrinkling Instability](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f373-gbju) - In its technology roadmap, NASA has expressed a desire to develop tailorable materials to better enable design and deployment of lightweight, efficient space structures.  For instance, lightweight, easily deployable and inflatable reflectors have garnered particular interest to replace conventional unwieldy mirrors for use on space probes.  Recent attempts to utilize polymer membrane technology as deployable substrate for a reflector have faced many technical hurdles: one limitation has been achieving the high surface accuracy required; another has been the presence of surface wrinkling under the complex boundary conditions necessary to pull the membrane taut.

We conjecture that the wrinkling phenomenon can be limited or even suppressed completely by utilizing a novel polymer based Liquid Crystal Elastomer material as constituent for the membrane.  Consequently, we propose to research the mechanics of Liquid Crystal Elastomer membranes, with emphasis on understanding the wrinkling behavior exhibited by these structures. We believe the prospect of developing a wrinkle-free membrane utilizing this material is exciting, and merits the attention and funding of NASA as it seeks to update its space technology infrastructure with innovative lightweight structures and tailorable materials. In a broader context, the interplay between structural and material non-linearities highlighted by this proposed research raises fundamental questions in mechanics worthy of thesis.

In the proposal, we will show a scaling argument that supports the hypothesis.  We  then propose to develop a numerical scheme that can accurately capture wrinkling mechanics as well as the material nonlinearities of liquid crystal elastomers.  This will enable us to investigate realistic space structure geometries, as well as novel complex shapes only possible due to use of liquid crystal elastomer material.  We also propose a clamped stretching experiment to further validate our claims.* [Nano-Engineered Materials for Rapid Rechargeable Space Rated Advanced Li-Ion Batteries, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4jjp-msqg) - Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are attractive candidates for use as power sources in aerospace applications because they have high specific energy, energy density and long cycle life. However, conventional Li-ion batteries experience loss of capacity and increased impedance and poor cycle life when they are charged/discharged at high rates over C-rate. These problems are magnified at low temperature operation. The limitations in the high rate capability of Li-ion batteries are mainly caused by slow solid-state diffusion of Li+ within the electrode materials Yardney/Lithion Inc., the world leader in cutting edge Li-ion battery technology proposes to investigate new non-toxic nano-engineered electrodes that significantly shortens the Li+ diffusion length within the electrode materials and increases the rate capability of Li-ion batteries. The goal of this Phase II project is to manufacture rapid recharge Li-ion battery for aerospace application. Yardney will manufacture 5 prototype cells capable of recharge at less than 15 min at room temperature. During the phase I we found that the nanoengineered anode showed excellent rate capabilities compared to planar electrode. Nanoarchitectured current collector provides higher safety due to large surface area contact with the active material and that acts as heat sink in high rate applications and also lower impedance.* [MOPITT CO gridded daily means (Thermal Infrared Radiances) V007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/piy4-skmi) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals.

The increasing use of hydrogen as a fuel places the safety of facilities and personnel at the forefront of concern, making an explosion proof fiber optic system a desirable option.  Further, the actual available fuel can depart significantly from the expected quantity due to variable boil-off and leak rates and inaccurate measurements.  Measurement accuracy can be complicated by low gravity, stratification of the liquid density and temperature, the presence of a gas phase, the wetting of tank surfaces by the liquid and the lack of suitable sensors and instruments.  The Phase II objective is to deliver a prototype that will withstand the high pressures and flow rates at liquid hydrogen and oxygen temperatures demanded by rocket propulsion systems.* [SMEX03 AMSR-E Daily Gridded Soil Moisture and Brightness Temperatures, Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/iuzc-fbha) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC.

However, attitude control is still performed using traditional methods involving reaction wheels and propellant ejection, which severally limits mission lifetime. To solve this problem, we propose propellantless attitude control using a polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) film, which is electrically switchable between transparent and diffusely reflective upon application of a voltage. This technology removes the need for propellant, reducing weight and cost while improving performance and lifetime.* [Explainable and Scalable Planning with Probabilistic Temporal Logic Specifications](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9qaj-ntiz) - Human spaceflight operations challenge currently available planning technology. They typically rely on a large number of integrated functions including mission planning, crew planning, solar array management, power and thermal management and system health monitoring. These functions serve under heterogenous uncertainties (stemming from anomalies and faults in equipment and intrinsic unknowns about the environment), time-varying requirements and multiple, possibly competing objectives. Co-work with the crew introduces unique difficulties as well. Humans’ capabilities and limitations in these capabilities add to the uncertainties. Humans’ preferences and need for compatibility between the humans and autonomous control protocols introduce unconventional constraints. The proposed effort introduces a paradigm shift in the planning-execution loop by addressing a number of these challenges. Our emphasis particularly on unambiguous, formal specifications and compilation of executable control software with provable guarantees and systematic sensitivity analysis diffuses the critical concern of reliability throughout the planning execution loop. The proposed algorithms will incorporate models with stochastic as well as nondeterministic uncertainties and rich specifications with temporal and logical relations as well as probabilistic and real-time modalities as needed. Integrated planning for the coupled functions introduces possibilities for system-level optimization, e.g., in performance, weights and overall cost. Finally, the proposed algorithmic and architectural advances will improve not  only the scalability of the resulting synthesis algorithms but also their interpretability by and explainability to the crew and designers.* [Conformal Carbon Nanotubes for Stray Light Suppression](https://data.nasa.gov/d/83yi-g96c) - <p>We have developed ultra-black CVD (chemical vapor deposition) and embedded carbon nanotube surface treatments for use in the near UV to far infrared for stray light suppression, near-ideal radiators and calibrators and detector absorbers.  We propose to develop techniques using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and electric field alignment to apply nanotubes to non-flat substrates to broaden their utilization to many additional components for space flight use.<p/><p>Our objective is to apply CVD and non-CVD carbon nanotubes to complex shapes that numerous scientists have requested for stray light control.  Currently, CVD nanotubes can only be grown on flat surfaces due to limitations in line-of-sight physical vapor deposition techniques such as e-beam evaporation.   For CVD our adhesion and catalyst layers must be applied on the on the component with extreme uniformity to a thickness of 1 to 2 nm for ideal performance.   Then the component must be placed in the thermal reactor furnace flow in a way that allows uniform exposure to the carbon bearing gas.  Our first focus area is to utilize atomic layer deposition (ALD) to apply our adhesion and catalyst layers conforming to the desired substrate surface.  This will allow fabrication of components that are dark on all surfaces instead of just on one surface.</p>* [In-flight Diagnostic capability for Crew Health by DESI-mass spectrometry](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nfrg-f7fa) - <p>The goal of this project is to develop a flight-compatible, direct analysis&nbsp;mass spectrometer that can enable in situ diagnostic analyses for crew health and environmental monitoring of chemicals. Mass spectrometry is a powerful technique for the identification and quantitation of biomarkers and chemicals, and direct analysis sources including&nbsp;desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)&nbsp;minimize the amount of sample preparation required. This project would allow in-flight diagnosis of DNA damage from radiation, monitor nutrient uptake and stress hormone production, track bone loss through biomarker analysis, and perform metabolic panel analysis to track organ health and function. Because analyses are performed with automated programs, new assays could be designed and implemented during the course of a flight mission through software updates, without needing to supply new reagents consumables. In-flight diagnostic capability is critical for spaceflight beyond the Earth-Moon system, both for the maintenance of crew health during the mission, and for understanding the effects of space travel on humans. Alternative approaches such as cold stowage of crew samples for future analysis become unfeasible as the number of crew members and duration of the mission increases due to volume limitations of Orion and other crew vehicles and also preclude informed real-time intervention. Without in-flight diagnostic capability, we will be severely limited in our ability to understand the effects of deep-space flight. The goal of this project is to develop a flight-compatible desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (DESI-MS) that can enable in situ diagnostic analyses for crew health and environmental monitoring of chemicals. Mass spectrometry is a powerful technique for the identification and quantitation of biomarkers and chemicals, and direct analysis sources minimize the amount of sample preparation required. This project would allow in-flight diagnosis of DNA damage from radiation, monitor nutrient uptake and stress hormone production, track bone loss through biomarker analysis, and perform metabolic panel analysis to track organ health and function. Because analyses are performed with automated programs, new assays could be designed by crew health experts on Earth and implemented during the course of a flight mission, through software updates. Assays of compounds of interest would be pre-programmed into the instrument and the data sent to Earth in an automated fashion. &nbsp; The proposed DESI-MS directly addresses the need for in-flight diagnostic capability called out in 6.3.1.3. Year 1 of this project will be an evaluation of the DESI-MS technique on laboratory instruments at JSC. Year 2 will be developing the prototype miniaturized DESI-MS instrument to position it for future funding opportunities (STTR, REDDI, etc.) to further mature the TRL. The proposed technology will miniaturize recently developed ionization technology to enable direct analysis of samples in situ with no sample preparation required. We plan to evaluate the Desorption ElectroSpray Ionization &ndash; Mass Spectrometry (DESI-MS) system for effectiveness on biomarkers of interest (bone loss, DNA damage, nutrition, etc.) and then packaged in a spaceflight-compatible form. The resulting instrument and assays we develop will be applicable for field / remote medicine applications all over the world, and will complement work done by National Institute of Health, Department of Defense and others for remote field medicine.</p>* [AMIGHO: Automated Metadata Ingest for GNSS Hydrology within OODT](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hhhm-5v6w) - GNSS sites installed by surveyors and geophysicists to measure land motions can also provide valuable and cost-efficient information about three critical hydrologic variables: soil moisture, snow depth/snow water equivalent, and vegetation water content. A pilot project in the western U.S. has demonstrated that these GNSS reflection data can be produced operationally, with data latency necessary for weather forecasting and measurement frequency appropriate for climate studies and satellite validation. 

Reflections from coastal GNSS sites can also be used to accurately measure water levels such as tidal motions.  Some of the 12,000+ existing continuously-operating GNSS sites globally could be producing hydrology and sea level measurements at minimal cost (GNSS H2O), but information technology limitations preclude inclusion of more than a handful of subnetworks in current systems.  To address this problem, we will advance the technology of the software that acquires and processes data from disparate and variable sources.  

Our objectives are to
1.   Enable operators of GNSS networks to provide current and past data to the GNSS H2O system.
2.   Build an infrastructure system to automatically ingest GNSS observations, evaluate station metadata, and produce hydrologic products from the GNSS data.
3.   Enable improved understanding of the GNSS water products through development and maintenance of a portal for visualization, mining, and data sharing.

We will leverage the proven Apache OODT (Object Oriented Data Technology) framework. This open-source system currently serves as the infrastructure backbone for various JPL, NASA, and non-NASA science data systems. Apache OODT framework provides configuration-driven components that can fulfill the GNSS H2O system's requirements and provide the scalability and extensibility required to ingest and process thousands of new data streams. Although OODT has proven to be a robust suite of software components for developing and operating a diverse array of science data systems, it does require a software developer's expertise and effort to configure an existing system for new data streams. This project looks to advance the technology of this software suite by designing and developing an automatic configuration layer that incorporates the software developer's expertise for configuring OODT components. In order to automate this process, we will first define a standard set of metadata for describing a GNSS station and its data and design and develop a web-based interface for submitting this metadata to the system. We will utilize a portion of this metadata to determine the suitability of a station's reflection data for generating hydrologic products. For example, we will pre-process the station metadata to determine (using Google maps and other publicly available geological data) the close proximity of roads and other geographical factors near the station that would render any of the GPS reflection data unusable for hydrologic products or sea level measurements. Our technology will also benefit any current or potential OODT user with variable, heterogeneous data sources. 

This project will demonstrate technology that enhances NASA's ability to efficiently provide Earth science data to scientists and the broader water management community, including urban planners that study coastal resilience for sea level rise and storm inundation.  It is directly responsive to the Data-Centric Technologies core topic of this opportunity in that it will improve information re-use, facilitate collaboration within the research community, and increase the speed with which scientific results are produced.   Airborne or in situ science data systems based on the OODT framework, similar to the Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE), will also benefit greatly from our automated configuration technology.* [SMEX03 Landsat Thematic Mapper Imagery: Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bzh8-sjhb) - This data set provides imagery developed from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data for use in studying land cover features during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03).

This tightly integrated system will consist of an airframe, avionics, and sensors specifically designed to measure selected gases and atmospheric properties. It is based on the commercial SuperSwift airframe and SwiftCore Flight Management System, which have been proven in the field to provide a cost-effective, powerful, and easy-to-operate solution to meet the demanding requirements of nomadic scientific field campaigns. The airframe capabilities will be expanded to achieve high altitude flights through strong winds and damaging airborne particulates. The SuperSwift's well-documented power and data interfaces will be employed to integrate the sensors required for the measurement of atmospheric volcanic phenomenon that will have broader applications for atmospheric research.


The atmospheric models that are employed by dispersion studies provide information that can affect human safety. Examples not only include volcanic ash aviation hazards, but pollution alerts, toxic releases, dust storms and wildfire smoke hazards that often depend on the accuracy of these models. Accurate data input from the location as well model validation are needed for these important safety systems. Even basic atmospheric conditions such as wind and temperature are estimated or modeled from nearest weather stations that could be far from the location of interest and at limited elevations. Ground systems, manned aircraft, balloons and even dropsondes supply this data but have limitations. Satellites such as ASTER, MODIS, AIRS and OMI are invaluable but can still suffer from infrequent coverage, cloud masking and limits in resolution. The SuperSwift XT will be designed to collect data in harsh environments and will enhance the performance and utility of NASA's Airborne Science fleet* [Investigation of the Hall Effect Thruster Breathing Mode and Spoke Mode Instabilities in the Very Near Field](https://data.nasa.gov/d/766g-3d6i) - One of the most practical forms of electric propulsion is the Hall Effect Thruster (HET), which makes use of electric and magnetic fields to create and eject a plasma. One of the most common HET designs is the stationary plasma thruster, in which an annular channel acts as an ionization zone where a radial magnetic field and axial electric field establish an electron Hall current. Despite the prevalence of this design in university and commercial settings, the physical mechanisms governing its operation are still not entirely understood.

I propose to conduct research involving time-resolved plasma measurements in the very-near field of a modern high-power Hall thruster. The goal of this research is to directly observe the variation of plasma properties in the ionization zone of a Hall thruster so as to quantitatively characterize some of the major instabilities known to occur in these devices. In doing this, the impact of these instabilities on performance can be determined, providing the insight needed to design more efficient Hall thrusters. The two main types of instabilities that I plan to examine are the spoke and breathing mode instabilities. These two turbulent effects originate in the ionization zone of a Hall thruster and generally occur with frequencies on the order of tens of kilohertz. To capture these effects in any capacity, time-resolved diagnostic tools must be employed. Although these instabilities have been examined before, there is limited data characterizing them in a time-resolved manner and virtually no existing data doing so in the very-near field. For each instability, I propose to examine its steady-state behavior, origin, and effect on thruster performance.

This research will be conducted at the Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion Laboratory (PEPL), where the material and personnel resources are well-suited for facilitating the proposed research. PEPL has the 6-m diameter, 9-m long cylindrical stainless steel clad Large Vacuum Test Facility, which has a pumping speed of 240,000 L/s on xenon using LN2 baffled cryopanels. To evaluate thruster efficiency, I will require diagnostic tools such as a Faraday probe, ExB probe, and retarding potential analyzer. These will allow me to measure current density profiles, current as a function of degree of ionization, and acceleration voltage. These quantities can then be used to determine various efficiencies, including mass utilization efficiency, current utilization efficiency, and divergence efficiency, as outlined by Liang and Gallimore.

For time-resolved measurements, I propose to use a high-speed dual Langmuir probe (HDLP). Technical limitations for a single Langmuir probe generally prevent it from being swept at frequencies greater than 0.01 to 70 kHz for a Hall thruster plasma. A HDLP can be used to identify time-resolved electron density, potential, and ion flux in the channel, and has been used to do so sweeping at up to 400 kHz. This represents the highest frequency full sweep data published to date, providing unheard of temporal resolution.

In-space propulsion is a major element of NASA's Technology Area Breakdown Structure (TABS), and specifically electric propulsion is a significant component of the In-Space Propulsion Systems Roadmap (ISPSR). The proposed research is therefore highly relevant in that it not only uses electric propulsion devices for a proposed investigation of plasma physics but it is intended to improve Hall thruster efficiency. In the ISPSR, two of the top three technical challenges highlighted are electric propulsion related. In particular, one of these challenges is related to high-power solar electric propulsion. The proposed research aims to explore the physics underpinning instabilities in Hall thrusters, and thus has the goal to provide new insight for next-generation Hall thruster designs. For this reason it will enable the development high-power solar Hall thruster propulsion solutions.* [MEMS Gyroscope with Interferometric Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sbcn-zzcy) - The proposed innovation is a novel MEMS gyroscope that uses micro-interferometric detection to measure the motion of the proof mass. Using an interferometric detection technique enables the measurement of proof mass motion with resolution equal to or better than systems that have CMOS detection electronics fabricated on the MEMS substrate. Furthermore, this detection technique can be applied to MEMS designs fabricated in a variety of processes, freeing up more design space and enabling a MEMS design not limited by MEMS fabrication constraints. This combination of factors allows for a broader design space and thus the sense resonant frequency will not have to be closely matched to the drive resonant frequency. This separation of frequencies results in a device that is inherently more stable and easier to manufacture. Specific objective of phase II are: (1) Produce a low cost, low power MEMS gyroscope using interferometric sensing that meets the needs for NASA applications. (2) Deliver multiple prototypes to NASA and other potential customers for evaluation. (3) Demonstrate that the gyroscope prototypes have acceptable performance. The challenges to successfully developing this technology are substantial. Advanced MEMS fabrication technology, innovative micro-optical designs coupled with novel MEMS packaging, and design and simulation techniques will enable successful development of this technology.* [Global Aerosol Measurement System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3b79-8d2b) - <p>The Global Aerosol Measurement System (GAMS) project is developing a new, low cost satellite capability for measuring the properties and distributions of particles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (collectively, the UTLS).&nbsp; This altitude region is important because there have been observed increases in the amount of particles in the UTLS.&nbsp; These particles typically reflect sunlight back into space and cool the Earth.&nbsp; GAMS will measure the altitudes and amounts of these particles by looking to the side of the spacecraft, through the thickness of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, and provide detailed information about how particles are changing in the UTLS.</p> <p>The goal of the Global Aerosol Measurement System (GAMS) project is to develop needed technologies and obervation strategies to optimally measure the distributions and properties of particles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS).&nbsp; The GAMS concept is based on the limb-scattering measurement techniques used on past sensors, most directly from the heritage of the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) Limb Profiler (LP) currently flying on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) spacecraft.&nbsp; OMPS-LP was launched on Suomi NPP in 2011, with the next planned launch of this instrument in 2022 on the next generation Joint Polar Satellite System-2 (JPSS-2).&nbsp; Because of the length of time between the NPP and JPSS-2 launches there is the potential for a significant data gap for these important measurements.&nbsp; The GAMS concept is intended to be a simple and low cost measurement system that could be ready to fill such a gap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The current OMPS-LP system measures light reflected by particles in the UTLS by looking behind the Suomi NPP path, looking through the thickness of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere (i.e., the limb).&nbsp; Although OMPS-LP has proven capable of detecting the presence of background particles in the UTLS, as well as particles from volcanic eruptions and meteorites entering Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere from space, it has very limited spatial coverage and suffers from sensitivity issues since it preferentially sees particles in one direct with respect to the sun.&nbsp; GAMS seeks to overcome both limitations by making measurements of reflected light In two or more directions relative to the spacecraft flight.&nbsp; Because GAMS focuses only on the limb profiling capabilities (versus the more comprehensive by more complicated OMPS system) it can be contained in a relatively smaller spacecraft, which will reduce deployment costs.&nbsp; Additional increased spatial coverage can be realized by flying multiple copies of the GAMS instrument in different orbits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At this stage of the GAMS project we are refining science requirements and measurement capabilities.&nbsp; Working with simulations of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) atmospheric model we are refining both the number of viewing directions and the number of spectral channels needed to adequately measure the particles in the UTLS.&nbsp; Engineering work is being performed to refine the GAMS measurement strategy, focused on detector design.</p>* [Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution](https://data.nasa.gov/d/x49s-bpqi) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI) 

Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation (WASP). Utilizing average monthly precipitation data from 1980 through 2000 at a resolution of 2.5 degrees, WASP assesses the precipitation 

deficit or surplus over a three month temporal window that is weighted by the magnitude of the seasonal cyclic variation in precipitation. The three months' averages are derived from the 

precipitation data and the median rainfall for the 21 year period is calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells where the three month running average of precipitation is less than 1 mm per 

day ae excluded. Drought events are identified when the magnitude of a monthly precipitation deficit is less than or equal to 50 percent of its longterm median value for three or more 

consecutive months. Grid cells are then divided into 10 classes having an approximately equal number of grid cells. Higher grid cell values denote higher frequencies of drought occurrences. 

This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate 

Prediction (IRI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Development of Reconfigurable Ka-Band Antenna Array](https://data.nasa.gov/d/myc7-huf9) - NASA requires small and lightweight communication and remote sensing systems to accomplish its missions. Often performance drives engineering designs, but for NASA, there is an inherent tradeoff between performance and weight. As would be expected, weight and size limitations impact system functionality and performance. Also, in many recent NASA missions, there is a need for communication system reconfiguration after launch.

These limitations have prompted a desire for multibeam and wideband antennas that can realize reconfigurable functionality. Reflector and lens antennas are typically used for satellites. However, phased arrays offer many advantages over reflectors and lenses. They provide higher aperture efficiency and power amplification at the element level. Also, they have no spillover loss, no aperture blockage, and better reliability. However, they have not been adapted as much due to their limited bandwidth and technology costs for reconfiguration.

Recent developments in wave slow down techniques using metamaterials have now allowed for very thin conformal antenna apertures that are concurrently broadband (as much as 10:1). This overcomes the ensuing conundrum of narrowband printed antenna technologies. Also, low cost multibeam approaches and software reconfigurable feeds are now possible to enable low cost conformal Ka band arrays. 

Here, I am proposing a novel wideband metamaterial technology that relies on our group's experience and recent developments on wideband small arrays and multibeam technologies. The proposed metamaterial array technology is based on the novel concept of emulating in-plane anisotropy to introduce many more design degrees of freedom to achieve significant wave slow down and wide bandwidth. As part of this fellowship, I will adapt these new metamaterial concepts to develop wideband (>4:1 bandwidth) Ka-band arrays. The array will also include low cost software-defined RF electronics for beam synthesis and reconfiguration.* [SiC Matrix Composites for High Temperature Hypersonic Vehicle Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rj5v-dk7c) - Durable high temperature materials are required for reusable hypersonic structural thermal protection systems. In particular, temperatures exceeding 2700ºF, and approaching 3000ºF, are targeted for capable structural materials that can survive stresses on the order of 10 ksi (70 MPa) for at least 100 hours in an oxidizing environment.  Such materials have been identified as an enabling material for future hypersonic vehicles  As this application is structural, a strong degree of damage tolerance is desired, and thus ceramic matrix composites
are the primary choice due to the desire for reduced weight, high temperature strength and oxidation resistance. Silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix (SiC/SiC) composites are believed to be the most suitable solution due to meeting the requirements
with the limitations of creep at the highest temperatures/loads, and oxidative attack at stresses that exceed the materials proportional limit. The proposed effort will define the temperature-stress limit of SiC/SiC composites, and examine methods to further extend this limit.* [Cyber Partners: Harnessing Group Dynamics to Boost Motivation for More Efficient Exercise](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6r4s-yjz8) - Original Project Aims/Objectives: The focus of the project is to use recently documented motivation gains in task groups (dyads in particular) to heighten the exercise experience for astronauts and help keep them motivated to exercise at levels necessary to mitigate reductions in aerobic fitness and muscle loss over long space missions. A secondary focus is to determine the most effective features in exercise partners for enhancing, enjoyment, confidence, and social connectedness. Specific aims: (1) Develop software to create Software Generated (SG) exercise partners and interface with exercise equipment (cycle ergometer) similar to equipment available on the International Space Station; (2) Test various design features of an SG partner within designed exercise video games to determine the most effective features for enhancing motivation to exercise, enjoyment, confidence, and connectedness; and (3) Test whether exercising with an SG partner over a 24-weeks, compared to exercising alone, leads to better aerobic capacity and muscle strength, adherence to exercise regimen, enhanced exercise enjoyment, self-efficacy, and sense of social connectedness.    
Key Findings since last report: In Year 3, we continued work on Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2 was a short-term study (6 days) to determine the most effective partners to enhance exercise intensity.    
In Aim 2, we tested an SG partner in one of three modes against an individual control condition: (a) coacting mode, where the subject cycled with the SG partner but whose performance was independent of the partner (i.e., they were not teammates), (b) conjunctive-teammate mode, where scores were based on the slower performer, and (c) choice mode where subject could choose coacting mode or conjunctive teammate mode for all trials. The experiment used activity routines developed by Ploutz-Snyder that consist of (a) 30 min. of continuous aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer at or above 75% of maximum heart rate (HR max) and (b) high-intensity interval training involving 4 repetitions of 4 min. at or above 90% HR max. In Aim 2 (Year 3), we tested an additional 38 chronic exercisers (22 female). Subjects (N = 82, 47 female; M age = 44.89, 9.45) were allowed to adjust the power output (watts) during workouts. The main outcome variable was average watts cycled above target prescribed watts. Results showed no condition main effects from baseline; however, during the 4 min. interval sessions conjunctive (Mdiff = 5.23 watts) trended toward greater exercise effort than control (Mdiff = 4.45 watts) and coactive conditions (3.46 watts). The 4 min. intervals probably represent the most motivationally demanding workout at 90% HR max. Increases in effort above target watts positively correlated with Enjoyment (r = .44), Self-efficacy (r = .51), and Team perceptions (r = .21) during the 4 min. intervals. No relationships were found with less intense continuous exercise. Although this pilot study did not find significant between group increases in performance effort, participants significantly increased their effort with our exercise video game (i.e., simulated bike paths).    
In Aim 3, long-term study, we tested an SG exercise partner in one of two modes: (a) conjunctive-teammate mode and (b) conjunctive teammate who is not always superior (NAS) and is sometimes surpassed by the subject (~15% of the time), plus (c) individual control condition. We finished both cohorts of subjects (Cohort 1 = 23; 11 female; Cohort 2 = 18; 7 female). Subjects (N = 41; M age = 45.53 8.12) exercised 6 days/week for 24 weeks, using the following aerobic routines developed by Ploutz-Snyder: (a) 30 min. of continuous aerobic exercise on a stationary cycle at or above 75% HR max, (b) 4x4 min. intervals at or above 90% HR max with 3 min. active rest, (c) 6x2 min. intervals at varying intensities with 2 min. active rest, and (d) 30 sec. sprint intervals at maximal effort with 20 sec. active rest. We first tested whether the Conjunc* [Extreme Energy Particle Astrophysics with ANITA-V [University of Delaware] Co-I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/masx-mwzg) - This is the Co-I for the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) mission. ANITA seeks to detect and elucidate the sources of the highest energy particles in the universe via measurements of cosmogenic ultra-high energy neutrinos. Such neutrinos are in many cases predicted to be the only unattenuated astrophysical messengers that arrive at Earth with precise directional information, since neutrinos are neutral particles with very weak interactions with matter in intergalactic space. Neutrinos that ANITA seeks to detect will signal the presence of the most extreme astrophysical accelerators and environments, and complement the information available via electromagnetic messengers from gamma-rays to radio waves.

ANITA uses a long-duration balloon payload equipped with 48 dual-polarization horn antennas to detect radio impulses in the frequency range 200-1200 MHz, within which the properties of cold Antarctic ice include extreme radio-transparency and depths of up to 4 km. If a neutrino interacts anywhere within the ice sheet in ANITA's view from stratospheric altitudes, we can detect the emerging radio impulse and determine its direction and other characteristics with high precision. This in turn allows us to select candidate neutrinos from among the thermal and anthropogenic backgrounds with high confidence, and to derive angular information about the arrival direction of such candidates as well.

Recently ANITA analysis investigated a new detection channel, which focuses on tau-lepton-generating neutrinos, which lead to a unique experimental signature for which ANITA has potentially very high sensitivity, and a candidate event has been detected in prior data. This new detection channel has added to the variety of methods by which ANITA continues to improve its sensitivity and reach into predicted models for cosmogenic neutrinos, for which ANITA has among the best constraints of any detector to date.

ANITA is currently the only active NASA mission with the capability to measure ultra-high energy neutrinos, and ANITA's ultra-high energy neutrino sensitivity while on orbit is unmatched by any other instrument, ground- or space-based. As such it is a direct contributor to our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe, through astrophysical messengers that provide unique information about the most extreme and energetic objects in the cosmos.* [Single-Process, Unitized, Composite Fuselage, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/snvy-6aj8) - NASA seeks tailored airframes and structures to reduce structural mass in support of the NASA Aeronautics Strategic Implementation Plan (2015), following the Roadmap for Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles, Subsonic Transport. Tailored structures are comprised of the right materials, at the right place, in the right orientation, in the right amount. Whatever the material or structural configuration, excess weight is driven out through optimization, within the limitations of the manufacturing approach. CRG has been laying the foundation for the design and production of tailored structures for more than a decade. CRG's vision for tailored airframes and structures begins with unitization, enabled by Smart Tooling for affordable manufacturing of complex composites. CRG began work on Smart Tooling for fuselages in 2005, targeting fully-integrated, single-process skins, stringers, and frames. CRG subsidiary Spintech launched in 2010 to commercialize Smart Tooling into the aerospace industry, and soon after demonstrated a quarter-scale unitized fuselage. Today, CRG brings robust capabilities in composite structural optimization, expanding capabilities in aerospace composite fabrication, leading-edge understanding of hybrid nano-composites, and Spintech's Smart Tooling technology to provide NASA with advanced, highly-tailored fuselage configurations with unmatched structural efficiency.* [Europan Molecular Indicators of Life Investigation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4kk9-yw3c) - The Europa Lander mission represents an enormous opportunity to capitalize on scientific discoveries at Europa by enhancing its planned exploration, toward a direct search for signs of life. The full understanding of Europa’s habitability will be established by the Europa Multiple Flyby Mission (EMFM). The EMFM payload, including highly capable imagers, spectrophotometers, mass spectrometers, and particle and wave sensors, will make critical observations of Europa’s subsurface ocean, its complex icy surface, and its surface-bounded exosphere to produce a clear picture of the extent and cycling of its water and chemical inventories. With this foundation, a follow-up lander will then be able to address hypotheses about key astrobiological markers in the icy surface. If deep plume activity is confirmed, the lander could potentially sample fresh, ocean-borne surface deposits for biosignature detection.
With these ambitious objectives, relative to the timeframe for lander payload selection, it is absolutely imperative to focus attention on instrument technologies that both (1) address expected complex molecular detection and characterization requirements with exquisite sensitivity and specificity, and (2) are on a realistic technical path to compatibility with the extreme payload resource and environmental constraints of a Europa surface mission. We propose to mature a Europa-specific implementation of the Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (LITMS) investigation to meet these dual requirements in the search for signs of extant life.
LITMS is a dual-ion source precision molecular analyzer derived from the substantial heritage of the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) investigation under development in our lab for the ExoMars rover. LITMS brings the power of both gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) of solid samples to fine spatial scales (sub-mm) with its precision analyses. As on Mars, detection of complex organics at fine scales offers significant advantages in examining features key to distinguishing biogenic and abiogenic molecules, compared to bulk analysis. LITMS further provides enhanced capabilities, compared to MOMA, including detection of both positive and negative ions, a wider range of molecular weights (to over 2 kDa), and direct evolved gas analysis – all of which substantially increase the sensitivity of LITMS to the widest possible range of molecular organic biosignatures within their geochemical context. LITMS has been developed for the past three years with support of the MatISSE program, and will achieve TRL 6 for Mars surface operations at the end of this year.
To re-achieve TRL 6 for a Europa lander mission focused on extant life, we will focus our COLDTech effort in three critical areas: (1) Refinement and validation of the precision sampling GCMS + LDMS operational modes for characterization of trace complex molecular biosignatures in cryogenic Europan samples; (2) Analysis, testing, and optimization of the appropriate LITMS hardware and operational mitigation approaches for the intense penetrating radiation at Europa; and (3) Design and development of a flight-like LITMS brassboard for Europa that (3a) rigorously meets PDR-level TRL 6 criteria, and (3b) enables a flight design demonstrably compliant with the most stringent planetary protection and contamination control requirements of the mission.
Lacking a requirement to redesign the core LITMS analyzer, which has already been developed at flight scale and meets extremely challenging measurement requirements for Mars missions, our proposed COLDTech development is able to devote significant and necessary attention to the Europa-specific features to minimize technical and cost risk of an eventual flight model. With COLDTech support we anticipate that LITMS could be among the few investigations that would be fully ready for the challenge of contributing to direct detection of life on Europa.* [Performance Quantification of Solar Sail Heliogyros for Planetary and Interplanetary Missions Using Multi-Scale Dynamics and Control Analysis](https://data.nasa.gov/d/94tm-ppn9) - The focus of this proposal is the guidance and control of a particular type of solar sail and supports NASA's exploration goals as outlined in TABS element 2.2.2: Solar Sail Propulsion. Solar sails are large, extremely thin sheets of reflective material that use sunlight to provide continuous thrust. To provide meaningful thrust levels, the sails must be lightweight, gossamer structures with several hundred square meters or more of reflective area. The primary advantage of sails is that they do not use propellant for thrust or attitude control allowing for theoretically infinite mission duration and infinite impulse. It is this elegance and limitless potential that make sails so attractive.

Research into this cutting-edge propulsion system has extraordinary promise for a wide variety of applications. Solar sails could make many prohibitively expensive missions cost-effective and enable many more that are impossible without sail power. For example, a sail-craft placed between the Earth and the Sun could enhance solar storm early-warning and help protect the nation's space assets. Also, a sail-craft could attack the growing threat of space debris by capturing defunct satellites, shuttling them to a super-GEO graveyard, and repeating indefinitely. Further down the road, sails offer the prospect of inexpensive, reusable cargo transport to Mars and beyond. These are just a few of the many applications of this technology. Nevertheless, much work remains before government and commercial agencies will commit to a large-scale sail-craft mission.

This research aims to further develop guidance and control for a specific type of solar sail: the heliogyro. In this case, the sail is divided into long blades supported by the centripetal acceleration of the spacecraft's spin alone. The heliogyro's attitude, and therefore thrust vector, is controlled by changing the cyclic and collective blade pitch similar to a helicopter. One advantage of this design over a more traditional square sail is the lack of blade support structure. This cuts mass and increases acceleration or payload capacity. Additionally, sail deployment is much simplified; simply spin the spacecraft up, and allow the blades to unspool.

The inability to effectively ground test such large, delicate structures makes a deeper analytical understanding essential. This research will attempt to show that heliogyros are a viable method of both attitude control and main propulsion. The objective is to answer three essential questions about heliogyro controllability: 
How much can heliogyros improve mission performance? 
What are the feasible attitude control methods to achieve that performance? 
How can we control the pitch of highly-flexible blades to attain the desired attitude? 
NASA, especially JPL and Marshall Space Flight Center, have been developing this technology intermittently for decades. As early as the sixties, JPL conducted preliminary design work on a heliogyro for a Halley's Comet rendezvous mission. More recently, they developed the S5 (Solar Sail Spaceflight Simulation Software) toolkit. Marshall launched a solar sail proof-of-concept, NanoSail-D, only weeks ago and is developing its successor, FeatherSail. This research will combine an analytical exploration of the fundamental concepts, simulations of the orbital and attitude mechanics, and finite element analysis of the sail structural dynamics to develop a comprehensive theory of the factors involved in solar sail control. The goal is to provide engineers with the tools required to design and plan a heliogyro sail-craft mission so that someday soon we may begin to realize the vast potential solar sails have to offer.* [On Applying the Prognostic Performance Metrics](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u9bu-4253) - Prognostics performance evaluation has gained significant attention in the past few years. *As prognostics technology matures and more sophisticated methods for prognostic uncertainty management are developed, a standardized methodology for performance evaluation becomes extremely important to guide improvement efforts in a constructive manner. This paper is in continuation of previous efforts where several new evaluation metrics tailored for prognostics were introduced and were shown to effectively evaluate various algorithms as compared to other conventional metrics. Specifically, this paper presents a detailed discussion on how these metrics should be interpreted and used. Several shortcomings identified, while applying these metrics to a variety of real applications, are also summarized along with discussions that attempt to alleviate these problems. Further, these metrics have been enhanced to include the capability of incorporating probability distribution information from prognostic algorithms as opposed to evaluation based on point estimates only. Several methods have been suggested and guidelines have been provided to help choose one method over another based on probability distribution characteristics.* [Microfluidic Label-Free Sensing for Rapid Multiplexed Pathogen Detection in Space Missions](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e2ry-j347) - For the success of most space programs involving environmental control and waste water management, the rapid detection and identification of pathogens under resource limitations is essential. From the basic scientific research standpoint, the capability to monitor and detect microbial responses to microgravity and other low-shear environments in situ would significantly advance the present state of knowledge. Current cell culture or molecular biology based methods are time and labor-consuming, vulnerable to contamination, demand laboratory equipment, and require sophisticated manual preparation such as lysing, staining or labeling.
To overcome these barriers, the PI proposes an integrated microfluidic sensor combining automated sample handling and label-free detection via molecular and plasmonic imaging that acquires molecular fingerprints from the whole organism, surface biomarkers and intra-organism biomarkers, thus achieving multiscale “compartmentalization”. The PI will actively collaborate with a group of microbiologists at NASA and other institutions to study microbial and viral responses to microgravity, high-energy radiation, genetic alteration, and emerging carbon materials such as nanotubes and grapheme.* [GPM PR on TRMM Precipitation Statistics, at Surface and Fixed Heights 1 day 0.25x0.25 degree V06 (GPM_3PRD) at GES DISC](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rm6m-bthu) - Version 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.

This is the GPM-like formatted TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) daily gridded data, first released with the "V8" TRMM reprocessing. The daily radar grid data is new for TRMM nomenclature and is introduced for consistency with the GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). The closest ancestor was 3A25 which was a monthly radar statistics.

This product consists of daily statistics of the PR measurements at (0.25x0.25) degrees horizontal resolution.

The objective of the algorithm is to calculate various daily statistics from the level 2 PR
output products. Four types of statistics are calculated:
1. Probabilities of occurrence (count values)
2. Means and standard deviations
In all cases, the statistics are conditioned on the presence of rain or some other quantity such
as the presence of stratiform rain or the presence of a bright-band. For example, to compute
the unconditioned mean rain rate, the conditional mean must be multiplied by the probability
of rain which, in turn is calculated from the ratio of rain counts to the total number of
observations in the box of interest. 

The grids are in the Planetary Grid 2 structure matching the Dual-frequency PR on the core GPM observatory that covers 67S to 67N degrees of latitudes. Areas beyond the ±40 degrees of latitudes  are padded with empty grid cells.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Final Weekly Combined Earth Rotation Parameters Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5sj6-5zbm) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Weekly Combined Station Position Earth Rotation Parameter (ERP) product (produced during the reference frame combination) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

The input to the Active Fires production are Level-1B moderate-resolution reflective band M7, and emissive bands M13 and M15. The fire algorithm first calculates bands M13, M15 brightness temperature (BT) statistics for a group of background pixels adjacent to each potential fire pixel. These statistics are used to set thresholds for several contextual fire detection tests. There is also an absolute fire detection test based on a pre-set M13 BT threshold. If the results of the absolute and relative fire detection tests meet certain criteria, the pixel is labeled as fire. The designation of a pixel as fire from the results of the BT threshold tests may be overridden under sun glint conditions or if too few pixels were used to calculate the background statistics.

The VNP14_NRT product contains several pieces of information for each fire pixel: pixel coordinates, latitude and longitude, pixel M7 reflectance, background M7 reflectance, pixel M13 and M15 BT, background M13 and M15 BT, mean background BT difference, background M13, M15, and BT difference mean absolute deviation, fire radiative power, number of adjacent cloud pixels, number of adjacent water pixels, background window size, number of valid background pixels, detection confidence, land pixel flag, background M7 reflectance, and reflectance mean absolute deviation.

The product provides day and nighttime active fire detection over land and water (from gas flares). The VNP14 product provides fire data continuity with NASA's EOS MODIS 1 km fire product.

RNA-Seq was used to define the large-scale gene expression profiles of Mizuna harvested after 27 days cultivation in the international space station to understand the molecular response and adaptation to space environment.Results: Total reads of transcripts from the Mizuna grown in the international space station as well as on the ground by RNA-Seq using next generation sequencing technology showed 8,258 and 14,170 transcripts up- and down-regulated in the space-grown Mizuna respectively when compared with those from the ground-grown Mizuna. A total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative marker genes were up-regulated including high expression of 4 hallmarks and preferentially expressed gene associated with ROS-scavenging genes was thioredoxin glutaredoxin and alternative oxidase genes. In the transcription factors of ROS gene network MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 OXI1-MKK4-MPK3 and OXI1-MPK3 of MAP cascades induction of WRKY22 by MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 cascade induction of WRKY25 and repression of ZAT7 by Zat12 were suggested. RbohD and RbohF genes were up-regulated preferentially in NADPH oxidase genes which produce ROS.Conclusions: Our large-scale transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the space environment induced oxidative stress and ROS gene network was activated in the space-grown Mizuna some of which were common genes up-regulated by abiotic and biotic stress and were preferentially up-regulated genes by the space environment even though Mizuna grew in the space as well as on the ground showing that plants could acclimate to the space environment by reprograming the expression of ROS gene network.* [Efficient Quantification of Uncertainties in Complex Computer Code Results, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3ae6-qwkf) - Propagation of parameter uncertainties through large computer models can be very resource intensive. Frameworks and tools for uncertainty quantification are generally geared to individual codes, are research codes, or are single-purpose tools such as LHS matrix generators. The Reduced-Order-Clustering-Uncertainty-Quantification (ROCUQ) methodology discussed in this proposal is specifically designed to circumvent many of the issues associated with uncertainty quantification of large simulation codes. The ROCUQ methodology has been applied in several different physical disciplines with good results. The computational methodology is a combination of reduced-order modeling, stratified sampling (Latin Hypercube Sampling -- LHS), statistical clustering of results (K-means clustering) and a few (five to ten) full-physics runs of the high-fidelity model under investigation. The method should be applicable to hundreds of uncertain variables when required. ROCUQ enables estimates of system response quantities (SRQ) uncertainty distributions for situations where it is not feasible to use purely sampling, collocation, or other techniques where many runs would be required. For some organizations, uncertainty analysis has never been possible due to resource limitations, and thus is not part of the organizational culture. Many analysts know that uncertainties can be important, but have no way to expend sufficient resources (money, CPU cycles, time) to do the work needed to quantify uncertainties. A methodology such as ROCUQ promises to open doors in organizations that know that they have the need, and may now be able to actually perform the analyses. Successful completion of the Phase II project will produce not only new software that will be able to be used by researchers and industry, but will assemble insights on the use of reduced order models in a variety of disciplines, and provide guidance and rules for the use of ROCUQ for the estimation of SRQ uncertainty distributions.* [Hiawatha Aircraft Anti-Collision System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/meqd-gy77) - For SUAVs, the FAA mandate to equip all aircraft with ADS-B Out transmitters by 1 January 2020 to support NextGen goals presents both logistical and mission security issues.  Aircraft without ADS-B Out capabilities, ranging from commercial or general aviation aircraft with failed transponders to adversarial aircraft deliberately operating without required transponder equipment, will continue to exist within the general airspace and pose navigational hazards and tactical threats to SUAVs. Nokomis proposes to adapt its ultra-sensitive RF sensor system, called Hiawatha, to provide an unsurpassed trajectory management and anti-collision avoidance capability.  The Hiawatha system provides flight-tested state-of-the-art ultra-sensitive RF detection, identification and geo-location performance.  Nokomis will develop a system-level design of an anti-collision system to aid in trajectory management and safe traffic flow of autonomous UAV operations capable of meeting the SWaP requirements for incorporation into a representative SUAV payload platform.  The RF-based traffic management and anti-collision avoidance system will be capable of monitoring the entire spectral range from 30 MHz to 3 GHz, while providing the necessary detection, identification, and locating abilities from all angles while operating in a non-interfering manner with other potential payloads. Specifically, Nokomis will demonstrate system sensitivity including long range detection and identification of representative UAV emissions, system geo-location and contact bearing capabilities, Doppler-based bearing and range to aircraft, and design Trajectory Prediction and Avoidance System and efficient Traffic Flow System for maintaining aircraft spacing. The Phase I effort proof of concept demonstrations will focus on a demonstration of the Hiawatha airborne system, detection, identification, and location of relevant targets using existing AoA algorithms, and existing source classification algorithms.* [Colloid Thruster for Attitude Control Systems (ACS) and Tip-off Control Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q6sy-k4ti) - Busek proposes to develop and deliver a complete engineering model colloid thruster system, capable of thrust levels and lifetimes required for spacecraft operational tasks such as tip-off de-tumbling and attitude control.   The self contained thruster system shall be capable of delivering ~75µN with sufficient total impulse to de-tumble spacecraft such as LISA.
 
The proposed Phase 2 work builds upon a highly successful Phase 1 effort where the key principals of the innovation, a propellant isolation membrane and a passive capillary feed system, were unequivocally demonstrated.  The proposed system is completely passive with no moving parts and requires no valves to ensure its high reliability.  In order to inhibit propellant contamination prior to operation in space, a unique isolation membrane will separate propellant from the emitter.  Upon heating the isolation membrane dissolves, allowing propellant from a collocated reservoir to flow forward to the electrospray thruster without contamination.  The thruster consists of an array of self adjusting emission sites that are activated by application of an electric field that initiates emission.  The delivered thrust is modulated by varying the applied electric field. 

The significant innovations of the proposed colloid thruster include: a compact, low power, modular thruster system containing no moving parts, which is capable of delivering sufficient thrust for spacecraft tip-off control and ACS applications.* [Model-Based Specification Checker for Multi-Domain Systems (SpecCheck), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bchn-8qa4) - NASA's software-intensive extraterrestrial exploration and observation systems are raising performance and reliability bars to unprecedented levels.  Exaggerating the complexity, in order for such systems to be robust and responsive they must have the ability to use intelligent processes to self-detect and heal, or literally create new programs in response to new situations.  Validating the readiness of such complex automated software for long term remote deployment demands not just covering code or branches, or even inputs and outputs, but rather to cover algorithms, rule bases, and states within the system.  Even when reducing the order of the problem through traceable model extraction and abstraction we are left with state explosion that drives the test of mission-critical software to unacceptable cost and time extremes. Yet it must be done. This has been a matter of active research at EDAptive Computing, Inc. (ECI), NASA, and elsewhere.  Modern specification and software modeling techniques combined with formal methods have yielded promising results.  We have demonstrated parts of the solution with smaller scale flight-critical [USAF] software and [MDA] satellite systems.  ECI is now uniquely poised to merge and bring the needed technology to fruition at the scale necessary for NASA Exploration Systems.* [Crucial Component Damage Detection, Monitoring and Mitigation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vmd7-wm5x) - This SBIR project delivers an on-board structural health-monitoring (SHM) system with embedded sensors that sense mechanical impedance deviations to flag incipient damage in time to recover from or prevent in-flight failures. This Component Damage Mitigation (CDM) system integrates early damage detection with failure recovery measures such as self-healing fasteners.

Implications of the innovation
Next Generation Air Transport Systems bring increasingly demanding weight and performance needs that encourage aircraft to operate relatively close to their design limits--minor structural failure can mean rapid catastrophe. On-board sensing, diagnostic, and damage mitigation capabilities are needed for early correction of incipient damage. However, no practical system exists. We address this deficiency by building on our existing SHM unit and incorporating damage mitigation.

Technical objectives
CDM leverages our work in impedance-based SHM. Our current prototype consists of a single custom electronics board, and is a TRL 5 unit. We have demonstrated field operation in Boeing launch simulation tests and on full-scale wind turbine blades. We propose to integrate our current approach with damage mitigation measures and to create a practical single-chip solution. We include computer modeling that generates virtual data in our sensor validation.

Research description
Phase 1 establishes feasibility for a single-chip approach based on the impedance method, and demonstrates damage mitigation on a model self-healing fastener. Phase 2 completes and validates single chip development, integrates damage detection and mitigation, and delivers an operational unit.

Anticipated results
Phase 1 demonstrates damage detection/mitigation integration and provides a detailed chip roadmap. Phase 2 delivers an operational unit that performs integrated damage detection, monitoring, and mitigation in crucial propulsion system and airframe components.* [Cradle-to-Grave Monitoring of Composite Aircraft Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qnzk-i9mb) - NextGen is proposing a simple yet powerful damage identification technique for advanced composite structures.  We propose to develop a damage index based on vibration signature comparison with original signatures of the structure. Our approach is to autonomously perform damage detection as well as identification of non-service loading events by minimum number of sensors. We will start with the preliminary work done by Dr. Mal at UCLA and improve upon it to achieve the objective of cradle-to-grave degradation monitoring. The overall goal of the program is to develop an accurate, rapid, inexpensive method for detection of composite internal damage including bonds strength in built-up structures. The objective of the Phase I program is to develop and demonstrate that the proposed technique is accurate and reliable.  We will achieve TRL of 2 in Phase I and subsequent technology transition to TRL of 4 in Phase II. NextGen's strength lies in related prior work, an in-depth understanding of damage modes in advanced composite structures, and comprehensive knowledge of damage detection techniques.  Dr. Ajit Mal of the Mechanical Engineering Department at UCLA has an exceptional background in structural health monitoring built on decades of cutting edge research in NDE* [NONA Cure of Prepreg Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n3fr-ckaj) - CRG's no-oven, no-autoclave (NONA) composite processing technology enables the fabrication of high-performance composite parts without the limitations imposed by autoclaves and ovens. The NONA infusion and cure of autoclave prepreg materials allows the manufacture of large primary composite structures without the expensive and energy-intensive capital equipment currently required for fabrication. The NONA process enables the remote fabrication of complex, integrated structures, dramatically shifting the composites manufacturing paradigm. Qualified autoclave or OoA prepreg tapes can be applied simultaneously with dry unidirectional (UD) tapes in an automated process. The presence of dry fibers throughout the layup before infusion allows improved breathing, removal of volatiles from prepreg, and improved compaction with only atmospheric pressure, mimicking the double vacuum debulk (DVD) process without the added equipment. NONA resin is then introduced to the evacuated layup at ambient temperature to wet out all available contact surfaces and cure itself and the prepreg in place. The NONA epoxy resin uses its own chemical energy to propel itself through a complete cure with no external heat required. With a high degree of crosslinking, the baseline NONA resin provides good strength, chemical resistance, and thermal performance up to 350 degrees F. Pairing NONA resin with a compatible prepreg, such as IM7/Cycom 977-3 or Hexcel IM7/8552-1, a cure of both systems can be achieved at room temperature. Because the cure occurs at room temperature, the NONA resin locks in its shape near room temperature, thus allowing the use of low-cost tooling materials, typically avoided because the of high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).* [Component-Based QoS-Driven Synthesis of High Assurance Embedded Software, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wpkf-tajw) - Software is an integral part of many complex embedded systems, such as avionics, scientific exploration, and on-board systems. However, poor software reliability is a major impediment to the success of these mission-critical systems. Testing, formal verification, and code synthesis techniques have been proposed to achieve more reliable software, with automated code synthesis being the most promising method. But synthesizing a complex system from scratch is costly.  A more practical approach is to synthesize systems from existing components, i.e., component-based system synthesis (CBSS).  Existing research in CBSS focuses on synthesizing systems bottom-up, which has severe limitations.  We propose to achieve CBSS by combining the top-down and bottom-up approaches. Specifically, we develop techniques to achieve automated system decomposition and semi-automated system architecture synthesis.  The IDEAL decomposition technique decomposes a system into ``IDEAL'' units that are mathematically composable and can be developed and evolved independently.  Consequently, the technique assures system reliability and enables on-the-fly feature/technology upgrades. The QoS-based architecture synthesis technique seeks to assure system QoS properties by synthesizing an architecture that optimizes QoS objectives.  It also facilitates on-board system adaptation due to resource and power constraints. Combined with bottom-up techniques, such as Amphion and pattern-based code synthesis, a dramatic leap in automated CBSS capability can be achieved. The proposed research will lead to sophisticated automation for synthesizing highly reliable, multi-mission capable avionics and exploration systems.* [HELIX: The High Energy Light Isotope Experiment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vaef-dbnm) - This is the lead proposal for a new suborbital program, HELIX (High-Energy Light Isotope eXperiment), designed to make measurements of the isotopic composition of light cosmic-ray nuclei from ~200 MeV/nuc to ~10 GeV/nuc. Past measurements of this kind have provided profound insights into the nature and origin of cosmic rays, revealing, for instance, information on acceleration and confinement time scales, and exposing some conspicuous discrepancies between solar and cosmic-ray abundances. The most detailed information currently available comes from the ACE/CRIS mission, but is restricted to energies below a few 100 MeV/nuc. HELIX aims at extending this energy range by over an order of magnitude, where, in most cases, no measurements of any kind exist, and where relativistic time dilation affects the apparent lifetime of radioactive clock nuclei. The HELIX measurements will provide essential information for understanding the propagation history of cosmic rays in the galaxy. This is crucial for properly interpreting several intriguing anomalies reported in recent cosmic-ray measurements, pertaining to the energy spectra of protons, helium, and heavier nuclei, and to the anomalous rise in the positron fraction at higher energy.

HELIX employs a high-precision magnet spectrometer to provide measurements which are not achievable by any current or planned instrument. The superconducting magnet originally used for the HEAT payload in five successful high-altitude flights will be combined with state-of-the-art detectors to measure the charge, time-of-flight, magnetic rigidity, and velocity of cosmic-ray particles with high precision. The instrumentation includes plastic scintillators, silicon-strip detectors repurposed from Fermilab's CDF detector, a high-performance gas drift chamber, and a ring-imaging Cherenkov counter employing aerogel radiators and silicon photomultipliers. 

To reduce cost and technical risk, the HELIX program will be structured in two stages.  The first stage, which is the subject of this proposal, will focus on the design and construction of the main HELIX instrument, and the measurement of key light isotope ratios from ~200 MeV/n to ~3GeV/n.  A future stage 2 will build on this work, incorporating evolutionary enhancements to the instrumentation to extend the energy reach into the challenging ~10 GeV/n range.  The stage 1 instrument achieves a maximum detectable rigidity of ~800GV and charge range from Z=1 to Z=10. The high field of the HEAT magnet will make it possible to reach the required mass resolution dm/m = 2.5% over the energy range of concern with very small systematic limitations due to multiple Coulomb scattering in the thin tracker. This is a decisive advantage over the current AMS-02 instrument which employs a permanent magnet with an average field ~7 times smaller than that of HELIX.

The primary scientific goals of the full HELIX program are:

- a high-statistics measurement of the 10Be/9Be 'clock ratio' to ~10 GeV/nuc

- a high-statistics measurement of the 3He/4He ratio to ~12GeV/nuc

- the first measurements of 22Ne/20Ne above 1 GeV/nuc

- the first measurements of 7Li/6Li, and 10B/11B above 1 GeV//nuc

A number of secondary goals will also be pursued including the measurement of several other isotopic and elemental abundance ratios and fluxes, as well as the primary Helium flux to ~125 GeV/nuc, where there is currently disagreement between AMS-02 and PAMELA on the shape of the energy spectrum.

The proposed work will be conducted by a team of US scientists and engineers with extensive experience in cosmic-ray observations on balloons or in space, and, specifically in magnet spectroscopy, with the SMILI, P-BAR, and HEAT programs.  Significant participation from a crew of more than 10 graduate and undergraduate students forms an important educational element of the program.* [A Multiscale Approach to Magnesium Intercalation Batteries: Safer, Lighter, and Longer-Lasting](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mgy7-kmy8) - Lithium-ion batteries are the gold-standard for electrochemical energy storage; however, the ceiling for their storage potential is constrained by the most fundamental of limits: each lithium-ion only supplies one electron. Safety issues associated with lithium-ion batteries caused by uncontrollable growth of lithium-metal spikes that cause shorts the batteries and can lead to overheating and explosions of the battery as well as the flammability of many lithium-ion battery components are of great concern for the development of space technology and in particular the development of deep-space EVA suits. Broadly, my proposal is to move from lithium and towards magnesium-ion battery technology, by further developing a novel cathode material (one of only a handful in existence), Z-V2O5 which we have previously synthesized in our lab. This material is remarkable, and is capable of reversibly intercalating Mg at room temperature up to a high volumetric capacity. My primary objective is to further develop the nanostructuring of this material and optimize the battery chemistry in order to realize a fully functioning prototype magnesium-ion battery. Furthermore, I will use a variety of characterization and modeling techniques to evaluate this incredible material and inform principles for the intelligent and directed discovery of additional Mg-ion battery cathode materials. 

To accomplish these goals, I plan to utilize hydrothermal synthesis techniques coupled with structure-directing agents to optimize to optimize the nanostructuring of these materials. I plan to use a diverse palette of topochemical transformations to stabilize the desired empty host structures as well as facile techniques for chemically evaluating magnesium insertion behavior. I will quantify and evaluate the behavior of each phase using DFT+U and Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations to determine expected operating voltages and diffusion barriers. Finally, to evaluate the effects of phase segregation during magnesiation, I will utilize Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) to map electronic structure domains. 

Not only does moving from magnesium to lithium theoretically double the amount of charge per unit volume attainable in a cell, but it also allows for the use of Mg metal as an anode, eliminating the need for heavy anode components found in lithium ion batteries (Sn, C) inherently improving the weight of the overall battery. Most importantly, making the switch to magnesium makes batteries inherently safer because magnesium anodes do behave in the same way, forming metal spikes and so avoid the risk of thermal runaway. For these reasons, my proposed research addresses NASA interest in nanostructuring of cathode materials,  the development of safer batteries for human life-support systems, and the development of batteries pack more energy into lighter devices (TABS: 10.2.1.4, 3.2.1.1, and 3.2.1.4).* [Turbine Engine Performance Estimation using Particle Filters, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gsku-u4jr) - Development of a nonlinear particle filter for engine performance is proposed. The approach employs NASA high-fidelity C-MAPSS40K engine model as the central element, and addresses the issue of lack of observability of some of the engine health parameters in previous Kalman filter formulations. Proposed approach does not require linearity of the dynamics or Gaussian noise assumptions for satisfactory operation. The feasibility of real-time implementation of the proposed approach will be demonstrated using commercial, off-the-shelf General Purpose Graphical Processing Units.  Phase I feasibility demonstration will show that the particle filter formulation of the engine performance monitoring system can overcome the limitations of previously employed approaches. Phase II research will develop a prototype implementation for hardware-in-loop simulations and eventual flight test.* [An Approach to Health Management and Sustainability for Critical Aircraft Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fz6u-am26) - Impact Technologies, in collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology and its industrial partners, proposes to develop and demonstrate innovative technologies to integrate anomaly detection and failure prognosis algorithms into automated fault mitigation strategies for advanced aircraft controls. Traditional reactive fault tolerant control approaches fail to provide optimal fault mitigation over a long period of time to guarantee the integrity of the platform for the mission duration. We will create a generic simulation environment to demonstrate fault detection and progression at the component level, using electromechanical actuators as a testbench.  The proposed Anomaly Detection/Mitigation system accepts sensor inputs, extracts features from raw data and employs an anomaly detection module to determine the presence of an anomaly with performance guarantees; a prognostic routine, built on Bayesian estimation (particle filtering) techniques to estimate the remaining useful life of the component; finally, a mitigation strategy trades off between performance and control authority to extend the life of the failing component until the mission is completed. This innovative prognostics-enhanced approach to fault mitigation uses Model Predictive Control techniques running in real time. Core algorithms will be implemented on embedded systems and used in hardware-in-the-loop demonstrations.* [Doppler Lidar for Measurement of High-Altitude Aircraft Wake Vortices](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9aei-ybvm) - <p>We are developing a Doppler lidar technology for detecting and measuring wake vortices of aircraft. This lidar has been largely developed for meteorological applications, and we are exploring its adaptation to use in this aeronautics application. Wake vortex considerations are important in preventing harmful turbulence encounters in our nation's airspace.<p/><p>While ground-based Doppler lidar has been used to probe wakes of landing aircraft for many years, these lidars are of a low pulse energy (a few millijoules) that limits their use to short ranges and low altitudes within the atmospheric boundary layer. With NASA's advancement of high pulse energy (250-millijoules) lidar, aircraft wakes could now be measured at long ranges and high altitudes. A ground-based lidar could be used to measure wakes of overflying aircraft to altitudes as high at 20,000 feet. Furthermore, the high-energy lidar could be installed in an aircraft to measure the wakes of other aircraft in flight. The Airspace Systems Program (ASP) is committed to the development of Super Density Operations (SDO) concepts for NextGen. Wake vortices are a fundamental physical limitation that will need to be resolved to enable these SDOs. Understanding wake vortices is a crucial step in the path to NextGen. Under ASP, NASA's wake vortex prediction model development is world-class and is actively involved in both development and validation of these wake models. Access to previously unavailable enroute wake data that would result from this effort represents a huge opportunity to help enable the NextGen goals by providing the ability to conduct robust model validation critical to enabling SDO concepts. To start the development of measuring aircraft wakes from a distant location, we are having an aircraft fly over the lidar in such a way that the aircraft's wakes will drift over the lidar's beam. By placing the target wakes at a known location, we will capture the signal's indicative of a wake vortex. An automated algorithm could then be developed to automatically scan for and lock onto a wake vortex signature. We are also making preliminary designs of adapting the lidar's operation in an aircraft for currently-used meteorological wind measurements to wake vortex measurements. These changes are in the scan pattern of the lidar beam and signal processing.</p>* [Novel 3D C-SiC Composites for Hot Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/usch-2kaa) - Future NASA hypersonic vehicles offer a potential to incorporate advanced ceramic matrix composites (CMC).  The key characteristics include excellent mechanical properties, excellent thermal shock resistance  and ability to survive cyclic oxidation environments.  Among the CMC composites carbon fiber-SiC matrix composites offer excellent high temperature capabilities.  The highest specific strength C-SiC composites are fabricated via conventional Chemical Vapor Infiltration (CVI) SiC method.  There are several limitations to SOTA CVI SiC technology.  First, fixturing is required during the processing.  Secondly, transverse mechanical properties are quite often design limiting criteria, thirdly manufacturing times are very long and fourth the fabrication of very large parts is limited due to huge capital investments required for very large equipment needed to operate at very low pressure.  This proposal addresses all the above stated limitations of classical CVI.  First it offers unique 3-D preform capable of increasing transverse properties with minimum degeneration of the in plane properties.  Secondly the proposed processing eliminates the need of fixturing.  Thirdly, modified CVI SiC significantly reduces processing time.  And fourth, Phase II will extend to incorporate extremely novel atmospheric pressure CVI SiC, offering a paradigm shift in CVI SiC by allowing to utilize conventional, low cost atmospheric pressure furnaces routinely used in heat treating applications.* [A Diagnostic Approach for Electro-Mechanical Actuators in Aerospace Systems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sz6n-f9rn) - Electro-mechanical actuators (EMA) are finding increasing use in aerospace applications, especially with the trend towards all all-electric aircraft and spacecraft designs. However, electro-mechanical actuators still lack the knowledge base accumulated for other fielded actuator types, particularly with regard to fault detection and characterization. This paper presents a thorough analysis of some of the critical failure modes documented for EMAs and describes experiments conducted on detecting and isolating a subset of them. The list of failures has been prepared through an extensive Failure Modes and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) reference, literature review, and accessible industry experience. Methods for data acquisition and validation of algorithms on EMA test stands are described. A variety of condition indicators were developed that enabled detection, identification, and isolation among the various fault modes. A diagnostic algorithm based on an artificial neural network is shown to operate successfully using these condition indicators and furthermore, robustness of these diagnostic routines to sensor faults is demonstrated by showing their ability to distinguish between them and component failures. The paper concludes with a roadmap leading from this effort towards developing successful prognostic algorithms for electromechanical actuators.* [Integrated Health Monitoring and Fast on-Line Actuator Reconfiguration Enhancement (IHM-FLARE) System for Air Vehicles, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w67i-in5m) - SSCI proposes to develop innovative algorithms for the integration of Health Monitoring (HM) subsystem with the existing FLARE (Fast on-Line Actuator Reconfiguration Enhancement) system that achieves rapid stabilization of the closed-loop flight control system in the presence of flight-critical failures. While both systems generate on-line estimates of the failure-related paramaters, the HM system can generate false failure information, while the FLARE system may result in poor performance in subsequent flight regimes if its parameter estimates are far from their true values. The main idea is to combine the failure parameter estimates from the HM and FLARE systems to assure robustness to false alarms, missed detections and detection delays in the HM system, and to use the combined estimate in the adaptive reconfigurable control law to assure the desired closed-loop performance. In order to achieve the project objectives, we plan to carry out the following tasks in Phase I: (i) Modify F/A-18 aircraft simulation to test the feasibility of the proposed approach; (ii) Develop the IHM-FLARE architecture and algorithms; and (iii) Evaluate the performance of the flight control system under false failure information. Phase II will result in algorithm enhancements, and implementation and testing using high-fidelity and piloted F/A-18 simulations. Boeing Phantom Works (Mr. James Urnes, Sr.) will provide technical and commercialization support throughout the project.* [SMEX03 Regional Ground Soil Moisture Data: Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f3ue-xv3k) - This data set comprises gravimetric soil moisture and soil bulk density data collected during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03), which was conducted during June and July of 2003 in northern Alabama and southern Tennessee, USA.* [Cold-Lightweight Imagers for Europa (C-LIFE)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qf9r-9wh8) - Europa and other Ocean Worlds may possess extant life; sending a lander has become a high priority. Several types of imaging are needed to advance the science and operations. Cold-Lightweight Imagers for Europa (C-LIFE), is an instrument suite containing a stereoscopic color imager (SI) and a uniocular microscopic polarizing imager (MI). The SI achieves resolutions of 1 mm/pixel from a range of 3m in 3 color filters, while the MI illuminates samples with filtered LEDs and characterizes ice grains and non-ice materials down to plate scales of 10 microns/pixel. C-LIFE objectives are to: (1) Search for evidence of biomarkers and/or life, particularly with the microscopic imager; (2) Characterize surface properties and local geologic context; and (3) Guide surface activities for sample collection.

Small cameras on landed missions represent a mature technology for missions to Mars, but not in the thermal and radiation environments of Europa and other Ocean Worlds, especially given severe mass and power limitations. For example, mass and power limitations drive us to use small pixel format CMOS detectors that lack adequate testing. We expect electronics inside the shielded lander will have a high TRL, but the external camera components require development to meet the challenging requirements such as very low mass and power, radiation tolerance, and planetary protection protocols.

The University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (UA LPL) plans to propose such an instrument concept for a Europa lander and other Ocean-World landers in the future. The UA team has extensive relevant experience, including Phoenix SSI and RAC, Cassini-Huygens DISR, Mars Pathfinder IMP and, most recently, OSIRIS-REx OCAMS.  In this COLDTech effort, we advance the qualification of several key elements of C-LIFE in readiness for flight opportunities to Ocean Worlds by: (1) Developing a detector testbed capable of down-selecting candidate CMOS devices, (2) Testing CMOS detectors, filters and micro-polarizing arrays in relevant environments, (3) Measuring the refractive indices of rad-hard lenses at ocean-world temperatures, (4) Fabricating and testing a Sample Transport Mechanism to deliver samples to the MI and (5) Constructing engineering models of the MI and SI and testing in relevant environments.

We expect the key subsystems to progress from TRL 3 or 4 to TRL 5 or 6 via this proposed effort. To achieve these goals we are partnering with the Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL), which provides some key capabilities and facilities to complement those at UA. Together with our SDL partners, we will thermal and radiation test a number of promising new commercial off-the-shelf CMOS detectors to identify the best candidate for C-LIFE. We will also collaborate with industrial partners such as e2v and ONSemi for detectors, 4D Technology for micropolarimeter arrays and PIXELTEQ for filters.  Prototypes of the successful SI and MI design will be fabricated and tested under relevant environments at UA to achieve TRL 5/6.

  Increasing the technical readiness of C-LIFE directly addresses COLDTech objectives to develop and advance the maturity of science instruments focused on understanding habitability and the detection of evidence of life in the ocean worlds of the outer Solar System. Recommendations of the upcoming Europa Lander Science Definition Team Report will be folded into our design to the extent possible when the report becomes available.* [Rapid Electrochemical Detection and Identification of Microbiological and Chemical Contaminants for Manned Spaceflight Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/etez-iz7e) - &lt;p&gt;A great deal of effort has gone into the development of point-of-use methods to meet the challenge of rapid bacterial identification for both environmental monitoring and clinical applications.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, most of the methods developed rely on Preliminary Chain Reaction (PCR) and face inherent limitations because of the requirement for enzymatic components and thermal control.&amp;nbsp; Other methods based on surface plasmon resonance, quartz crystal microbalance, and fluorescence has been reported with good detection limits, but, these methods are immunological and cannot provide genetic-level information.&amp;nbsp; Further, they require labeled markers, complicated fluid handling systems, and sensitive optics that drive up cost and complexity and preclude them from outside the laboratory.&amp;nbsp; Recent work by a group at the University of Toronto has focused on developing an electrochemical platform that combines ultrasensitive detection, straightforward sample processing, and inexpensive components to create a cost-effective, user-friendly device for detection and identification of microorganisms.&amp;nbsp; The platform combines an electrical cell lysis chamber, and electrochemical reporter system, and nanostructured microelectrodes (NMEs) to detect specific nucleic acid sequences.&amp;nbsp; The nucleic acid sequences are unique to a given type of microorganism and can be used to identify the microorganisms present in a sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of the anticipated prototype device &amp;nbsp;(Lam, et al. 2012. &lt;em&gt;Polymerase Chain Reaction-Free, Sample-to-Answer Bacterial Detection in 30 Minutes with Integrated Cell Lysis&lt;/em&gt;. Anal. Chem. &lt;strong&gt;84(1)&lt;/strong&gt;: 21-5), detection of microbial contaminants will begin with a lysis chamber designed to release DNA and RNA from microorganisms present in the sample using ultrasonic or electrochemical technology.&amp;nbsp; The DNA and RNA mixture is then passed into an analysis chamber containing an array of nanostructured microelectrodes (NMEs).&amp;nbsp; The surface of the NMEs will be functionalized with probe molecules for DNA or RNA sequences specific to the bacteria being targeted.&amp;nbsp; Binding of the DNA or RNA to the appropriate detection probe on the NME surface in the presence of an electrochemical reporter system will change the electrochemical properties of the NMEs.&amp;nbsp; A potentiostat is used to measure the current at each individual electrode before and after addition of the DNA and RNA mixture.&amp;nbsp; The difference in current before and after addition of the mixture to the NMEs is compared against a pre-determined threshold to check for the presence of target bacteria in the sample.&amp;nbsp; The process for detection of chemical contaminants is very similar.&amp;nbsp; The lysis chamber would be bypassed and the sample would flow directly into the analysis chamber.&amp;nbsp; The NMEs will be functionalized with molecules to selectively bind the desired targets (analytes) and the change in the electrochemical response of each NME can again be used to detect and quantify the contaminants.&amp;nbsp; Depending on the analyte of interest, it may be possible to directly measure analyte binding on the surface of the NMEs without the use of an electrochemical reporter system. The overall project will focus on optimization of the individual aspects of the detection platform in preparation for construction of a prototype for a flight experiment.&amp;nbsp; The scope of the work in this proposal is limited to characterization and optimization of the lysis step/sample preparation, probe selection, and NME structure.&amp;nbsp; Lysis conditions will be optimized by evaluating parameters associated with the oscillation frequency and lysis time for ultrasonic techniques and applied voltage for the electrochemical techniques.&amp;nbsp; Cell viability, as determined by fluorescent detection of DNA or R* [Precise Automatic Image Coregistration Tools to Enable Pixel-Level Change Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nab4-t3ug) - Automated detection of land cover changes between multitemporal images (i.e., images captured at different times) has long been a goal of the remote sensing discipline.  Most technology in this area has focused on methods for detecting and identifying land cover or surface object changes in two or more images, but precise co-registration of images remains a key challenge. In fact, image-to-image registration and image-based change detection are intricately related, as the success of conducting both relies on the precision of the other; software that supports these functions should do so in an integrative manner. Image registration is the key factor influencing the success of detecting land cover changes at or near pixel scale.  We will develop tools in the form of a "software development kit" (SDK) specifically optimized for precise co-registration of two or more images with minimal user interaction, with the primary motivation to enable change detection algorithms to focus on salient changes rather than highlight image registration errors.  The SDK will be available to NASA at no cost, after which we will build user applications based on the SDK for commercial offering.* [Advanced Physical Models and Numerical Algorithms to Enable High-Fidelity Aerothermodynamic Simulations of Planetary Entry Vehicles on Emerging Distributed Heterogeneous Computing Architectures](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9jg2-fj2y) - The design and qualification of entry systems for planetary exploration largely rely on computational simulations. However, state-of-the-art modeling capabilities introduce substantial limitations in providing accurate and reliable predictions for aerothermodynamic flow environments of such entry, decent, and landing vehicles. These challenges are attributed to (i) the complexity of coupled multiphysical processes; (ii) limited experimental data for model validation; and (iii) the absence of advanced numerical algorithms and physical models for the accurate and efficient simulation of aerothermodynamic flows. By addressing these issues, the overall objective of this research is the development of advanced high-order numerical methods and high-fidelity physical models for the reliable prediction of aerothermodynamic flows that are relevant to hypersonic and atmospheric entry vehicles. Novel programming paradigms will be used for accelerating multiphysics simulation codes on emerging heterogeneous computing architectures. Combined, these modeling capabilities will provide improved predictions of heat-transfer, particle-laden reacting flows, and hypersonic environments to support the development of next-generation entry, descent, and landing systems.* [Tensegrital Wheel for Enhanced Surface Mobility, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gavm-dr2f) - ProtoInnovations introduces the "tensegrital wheel" an inventive concept for wheeled locomotion that exploits the geometric and mechanical attributes of a tensegrity structure to engage with the terrain in an effective and efficient manner. The tensegrital wheel emulates the behavior of a variable pressure tire without the need for an inflation system. The construction of the tensegrital wheel is such that it absorbs and diffuses ground forces fairly evenly. The stiffness of the tensegrital wheel can be tuned to match the demands of a given environment that the wheel is to operate in or can be adjusted on-the-fly. These attributes allow for better adaptation to the terrain thus increasing the amount of thrust that can be generated at the wheel/ground interface, and improving a vehicle's dynamic response and obstacle negotiation abilities. We assert that the tensegrital wheel can be designed to achieve a very high strength-to-weight ratio and exceptional capacity for long-life specifically in the context of planetary exploration. For the Phase I of this SBIR project we aim to prove the feasibility of the tensegrital wheel and quantify its capabilities and limitations through analysis, prototyping, and testing.  The technology proposed here is of particular value to planetary missions involving mobility over various terrain geometries and ground compositions.* [Adverse event detection, monitoring, and evaluation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bcbg-ye6c) - This SBIR project delivers a single-sensor structural health-monitoring (SHM) system that uses the impedance method to monitor structural integrity, wave propagation methods to assess surfaces, and acoustic SHM to detect adverse events (impacts). This Adverse Event Detection (AED) unit supports nondestructive evaluation (NDE) systems and evaluates advanced composite structures.
Implications of the innovation
Increasingly demanding weight and performance needs encourage widespread use of composite materials. New systems are needed to detect incipient flaws in composites before damage becomes critical. Health analyzers that actively examine structures across several length and time scales in an autonomous fashion greatly reduce the number of sensors required and lower system complexity and cost; however, no practical system exists. We address this deficiency by building on our existing SHM system.
Technical objectives
AED leverages our previous NASA SHM research. Our initial Phase 1 prototype takes the form of a single custom printed circuit board, and is a TRL 5 unit. We have demonstrated both the impedance method and wave propagation SHM as implemented by a single sensor. Phase 1 will focus on performing similar demonstrations for acoustic SHM using the same single sensor element.
Research description
We have established feasibility for a chip-level approach that combines the impedance method and wave propagation, and demonstrated damage detection on a model composite. Phase 1 will validate chip-level feasibility for acoustic operation, and demonstrate this additional capability in a laboratory prototype.
Anticipated results
Phase 1 attacks the problem of monitoring structural integrity across multiple time and distance scales and completes a TRL 5 prototype that can be deployed wirelessly. Phase 2 delivers a TRL 6 unit that autonomously senses damage across several length and time scales by integrating impedance based, wave propagation, and acoustic SHM.* [Wearable Beat to Beat Blood Pressure Monitor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/izxw-8qga) - A key component of NASA's human exploration programs is a system that monitors the health of the crew during the space missions. The wearable physiological monitor proposed by Linea Research Corporation can be used to continuously observe the beat to beat blood pressure. The monitor can be used to observe the physiological effect of various countermeasures against prolonged exposures to reduced gravitational environments. The proposed device will allow the monitoring of the pharmacological effect on blood pressure over prolonged periods. Currently, beat to beat monitoring of blood pressure is done primarily in hospital settings through invasive procedures involving percutaneous insertion of catheters into the radial or brachial arteries. While non-invasive beat to beat blood pressures based on either the Penaz method or arterial applanation tonometry are currently available, they each have limitations. In addition, all monitors are based on large stationary equipment that requires the subject to be immobile. Successful implementation of the proposed program will result in an accurate wearable beat to beat blood pressure measurement.* [Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) as an Analogue of Post-flight Sensorimotor Dysfunction](https://data.nasa.gov/d/aisg-3uje) - Aim 1A (complete): Tolerance to GVS. Dilda, V, MacDougall HG, Moore, ST. Tolerance to extended Galvanic vestibular stimulation: optimal exposure for astronaut training. Aviat Space Environ Med. 2011 82:770-774.     
Aim 1B (complete): Cognitive effects of GVS. Dilda, V, MacDougall HG, Curthoys IS, Moore, ST. (2012) Effects of Galvanic vestibular stimulation on cognitive function. Exp Brain Res, 216:275-285.    
Aim 2 (complete): GVS as an analog of post-flight spatial disorientation. Moore ST, Dilda V, MacDougall HG (2011) Galvanic vestibular stimulation as an analog of spatial disorientation after spaceflight. Aviat Space Environ Med, 82; 535-542.     
Aim 3 (complete): Adaptation to repeated exposures to GVS. Postural and locomotor function recovered in an exponential pattern over 12 weeks of weekly 10-min GVS exposures, and this improvement was maintained at week 18 and 36 follow-ups. The exponential pattern of postural recovery was similar to that observed in shuttle astronauts post-flight. GVS adaptation did not occur at the vestibular end-organs or involve changes in low-level vestibulo-ocular or vestibulo-spinal reflexes. Faced with unreliable vestibular input, the CNS reweighted sensory input to emphasize veridical somatosensory and visual information to regain postural and locomotor function. After a period of recovery subjects exhibited dual adaptation and the ability to rapidly switch between the perturbed and natural vestibular state for up to 6 months, analogous to veteran astronauts. GVS trained subjects performed significantly better than untrained controls (p=0.01) on a visuomotor task in a full motion simulator during unpredictable motion, suggesting a protective effect of GVS exposure in novel vestibular environments.* [Self-Regulating Capillary Flow Networks for Electrospray Micropropulsion Devices](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gjvy-wsq2) - Advances in miniaturization of electronics and MEMS devices enable microsatellites and CubeSats to perform tasks that previously required massive satellites. Low launch costs of these microsatellites will make existing applications cheaper and revolutionize access to space, leading to an explosion of diversity in orbital systems. But a reliable micropropulsion system is needed to allow CubeSats to perform the same orbital maneuvers as traditional satellites, and even be used for swarming and deep-space missions.

One promising technology is electrospray micropropulsion. Traditional large-scale electrospray propulsion induces an electric field with a negative electrode above the surface of a conductive propellant, causing emission of ions or droplets. It has been tested successfully in space on the LISA Pathfinder mission. Electrospray micropropulsion miniaturizes this technology; the thrusters are so small and light that you could easily fit five or six in the palm of your hand. A leading design is external-flow microfluidic electrospray propulsion (MEP).

Emission technology is advancing steadily, but a key roadblock is the development of a propellant management device (PMD) to regulate flow from storage to the emitters. The laws of fluid dynamics prevent large-scale PMDs with their pumps, valves, and pipes from working at the micro scale. Development of effective micro PMDs is the final technological step required for the electrospray micropropulsion. We propose a novel self-healing microfluidic PMD, and the results of our research will be easily adaptable to other microfluidic projects such as lab-on-a-chip devices for extraplanetary or medical uses, focus beam spectrometers, electron microscopes, and milling devices. 

An earlier approach to micro PMDs relied on internal wicking, precluding fine control of the design or self-regulatory flow characteristics. Our proposed PMD will consistently and robustly feed propellant to the emitter, automatically adjust for varying emitter conditions, self-heal and resist perturbations, and avoid clogging. This can be accomplished by using external wicking instead of internal flow.

Although internal and external capillary wicking are both related to surface tension, they are fundamentally different processes. Internal wicking (flow through a narrow pipe) is well understood. The enclosure forces the flux to be constant in space, so the fluid dynamics are governed by a single parameter (the distance the fluid has wicked) and local flow control is impossible.

	External wicking (capillary flow with a free surface, e.g. in a groove) is not well understood, but its complexity increases the possibilities for flow control. The existence of a free surface allows flux and local pressure to vary dynamically. And external groove flow is automatically self-healing: fluid avoids regions with too much propellant and flows to underfilled regions, making it a natural fit for PMDs.

	External flow is also controllable. Unlike internal flow, the free surface can couple both to the geometry of the substrate and external electromagnetic fields; hence flow can be precisely controlled at every point from start to end. This potential for extremely fine fluid control is not trivial; the highly nonlinear partial differential equations governing the dynamics are very difficult to solve. But with thorough analysis and numerical modeling, the power of free surface control can be unlocked.

We have proposed designing an external-flow PMD specifically for the MEP. But rather than stop at designing a single PMD for a particular application, we also propose developing a comprehensive analytical and computational toolkit for self-regulating external flow networks. This toolkit will contain analogues of electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) so that fluid management systems for various situations can quickly and easily be developed by considering analogous electronic circuitry.* [Robust Multicore Middleware, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9khk-yp7b) - Current and emerging spaceflight processors are leveraging heterogeneous multicore/co-processor architectures to satisfy the ever increasing onboard processing demands required by planned NASA missions. These architectures can provide increased processing bandwidth, power efficiency, and fault tolerance for onboard processing applications. However, these advantages come at the cost of increased hardware and software complexity. As software development is a major cost driver for missions, this increased complexity has the potential to significantly increase cost for future missions. To address this risk, Troxel Aerospace Industries, Inc. proposes to develop a robust middleware management technology for spacecraft-focused multicore/co-processor architectures. The proposed middleware technology will enable a fault tolerant computing environment that is agnostic to the underlying hardware and is largely transparent to mission applications executing upon the middleware to provide a standardized, intelligent resource, fault, and power management interface.* [Application of Advanced Electromagnetic Arrays to High Efficiency, High Bandwidth, Redundant Linear Actuators, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y6b7-884p) - The proposed SBIR effort will employ a systems approach to develop motor/controller/screw element systems adequate for demanding launch thrust vector control and control surface actuator applications.  This approach will utilize high bandwidth, high efficiency, redundant motor systems coupled with appropriately paired motor controls.   The actuator system will consist of a high efficiency permanent magnet motor with a high number of current channels for system redundancy, an H-bridge based controller with a high number of parallel current channels and sufficient current capability to enable high system response, and conventional screw-based linear actuator elements.  The linear actuation elements will be designed with corrosion resistance, increased resistance to nut jamming, and inherent features preventing incorrect installation of the device.  These innovations are necessary to overcome the inherent limitations of today's actuator systems, which were developed based on the limitations of traditional motors, power electronics, and available actuator hardware. Phase I of this project will focus on the design requirements, key features, and suggested solutions for thrust vector control actuator systems.  The Phase II portion of the project will deliver a working prototype actuator.* [NUE - Novel Universal Ensemble Capability for Overset Grids, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3p4d-jr42) - Intelligent Light makers of the FieldView CFD/CAE Post-processing tool, proposes to develop NUE (pronounced noo-ae) - a Novel and Universal capability that manages an Ensemble of overset grid tools. NUE's assembly, flow solver and post-processing components accept grids from ANY grid generation package of ANY grid type to facilitate the ease of use of the overset grid methodology. Its components are coupled through an API or a Python Software Interface Framework (SIF) and utilize a standardized output based upon an extended version of pyCGNS. The Grid Assembly utilizes components from FieldView via a python wrapped server process that allows the user to launch grid assembly, flow solvers and to detect flaws in the overset grid system such as orphans points or by using FieldView advanced post-processing features to identify regions in need of grid refinement. FieldView can then create objects, such as CAD Surfaces, which the user can readily load into their grid generator to assist in overset grid modification or refinement. The user would be able to launch the flowsolver from within FieldView and then have automated reports available in a browser window. NUE represents a novel and standardized capability that allows all the components of the overset ensemble of tools to interact in a consistent manner - reducing the overall time that practitioners must spend in managing their simulations.* [An Affordable Autonomous Hydrogen Flame Detection System for Rocket Propulsion, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fmgw-qj3u) - NASA has long used liquid hydrogen as a fuel and plans to continue using it in association with their advanced nuclear thermal propulsion technology. Hydrogen fire detection is critical for rocket propulsion safety and maintenance. A significant fire at a rocket test or launch facility could be catastrophic to infrastructure or even worse, to human life. Detection monitoring is problematic as hydrogen flames can be nearly invisible during the day. Non-imaging, non-visible fire detection technology has limited range and can suffer from false alarms from sources outside the region of interest. Low-cost visible imagers, commonly used for wide-scale routine surveillance, have limited utility detecting hydrogen fires. Although it has been known for decades that multispectral imaging outside the visible range can be used to detect fires with low false alarm rates, the price of such systems and the lack of processing algorithms and the ability to implement them in real-time has largely prohibited their use. During this project we will develop a low-cost imaging capability that fuses data collected from sensors operating in the (1) solar blind ultra-violet, (2) thermal infrared and (3) visible spectrum, using advanced spectral, spatial and temporal processing techniques optimized to detect and generate alerts associated with hydrogen fires in real-time. This multi-sensor, multi-processing approach will enable us to automate flame detection with extremely low false alarm rates. In addition to control room alerts, we will make use of the wireless communication capabilities found within smart phones and other mobile devices to build an App to alert key decision makers and first responders of a fire detected in real-time. This multi-sensor imaging research could also support NASA's important cool flame microgravity research occurring on the International Space Station.* [Software Bus Network Message Routing Protocol](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sqvw-9nbz) - <p>The Software Bus Network (SBN) is a software application that enables seamless flight software communication between multiple processors or spacecraft.&nbsp; The SBN is an application that depends on the Core Flight Software (CFS) developed by Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).&nbsp; A version of the SBN application currently exists, but is limited by the fact that processors or spacecraft must be directly connected in order to make use of the SBN.&nbsp; This effort proposes to remove that limitation by implementing a router capability that will be able to send messages between processors or spacecraft that are not directly connected by relaying them through intermediate nodes.</p><p>The Core Flight Software (CFS) is a framework of reusable flight software services and applications.&nbsp; A key component of the CFS is a message bus that allows different software applications to send messages to one another using a publish/subscribe method.&nbsp; The message bus connects applications that are running on the same processor.&nbsp; As flight software becomes more complex, it becomes necessary to use multiple processors or even multiple spacecraft.&nbsp; The Software Bus Network (SBN) application makes it easier to use CFS software on multiple processors or spacecraft by providing a way for applications to communicate over a variety of interfaces.&nbsp; The SBN acts as a kind of bridge between the message buses on different processors.&nbsp; This allows communication to take place in a way that is transparent to all of the other software applications being used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>* [Data driven modeling of the simultaneous activities in ambient environments](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nazp-bdea) - Resident of a smart home, who may be an old person or an Alzheimer patient needing permanent assistance, actuates the world by realizing activities, which are observed through the embedded sensors of smart home. Typically, this person may sometimes forget completion of the activities; may realize the activities of daily living incorrectly, and may enter to dangerous states. In order to provide automatic assistance for the smart home resident through the embedded electronically controllable actuators and make the smart home resident able to live independently at home we propose to calculate a possibilistic logical space for correct realization of activities, which may be represented in form of a multivariable problem. Regardless from the physical entity (modality and location) of the intelligence source and the quantity of individuals who perform the activities; per each possible goal or activity, we consider a unique source of intelligence (for example a social mind) who directs the order of fuzzy events that occur in the ambient environment, then the plan behind world actuations is modeled applying extensions of the fuzzy logic. The main key point that we deal with is the analysis of the observations in order to make inferences about possible simultaneous activities that may be planned and realized by one or more individuals; so that we can reason in the cases the parallel activities are interrupted.* [Modeling of Activities as Fuzzy Temporal Multivariable Problems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hyv5-k2pu) - Smart Home resident may be an Alzheimer patient needing continuous assistance and care giving. Because of forgetfulness, this person may realize activities of daily living erroneously. In order to assist this person automatically in Smart Home, all his performed actions and activities are observed through the embedded sensors of Smart Home, and applying the data mining techniques his activities are analyzed. Then information about his activities is provided and in the consequence, comparing learned correct patterns and current observations the Smart Home may infer provision of assistance to this person at the appropriate moment. In this paper we propose a data-driven activity modeling approach, which supports reasoning in correct realization of the activities. Activities are presumed as the series of fuzzy events that occur shortly one after another. Per each activity, we calculate a fuzzy conceptual structure, and the model of activity is represented in form of a multivariable problem.* [Lunar Health Monitor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/crmd-cpcq) - Orbital Research has successfully demonstrated a dry electrode (no electrolyte or gel required) for heart rate and ECG monitoring.  Preliminary data has indicated that the electrode can be incorporated into a garment that does not require an adhesive for successful data collection.  Further preliminary data indicates that respiration rate can be deduced from the ECG waveform captured from the dry electrodes. The Orbital Lunar Health Monitor (LHM) will incorporate the patented dry electrode with other commercially available sensors in a garment resulting in fully wearable monitor of Astronaut Health.  The data from each of the sensor is processed, yielding a comprehensive image of overall health. Environment sensors are also incorporated to detect longer term health threats.  The LHM is comfortable and non-inhibiting. The Orbital Lunar Health Monitor is intended to enable continuous monitoring of health status of Astronauts both in  intra- and extra-vehicular sorties.* [NACP Regional: National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Aggregated Gridded Model Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/stn9-87jb) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides two products that were derived from the recently published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis 1-degree terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs (Gridded 1-deg Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et al., 2013). The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional Synthesis - Description of Observations and Models.* [Rapid Development of Flight Software for a Complete Guidance, Navigation, and Control Subsystem Using Simulinkâs Auto-coding Capabilities](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8yqb-e8h3) - <p>The proposed task will create new processes and tools for automatically generating flight code for the entire Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) subsystem&nbsp;using the approach of&nbsp;translating GNC models generated by commercially available modeling and simulation tool(s) into multiple&nbsp;software applications for&nbsp;the standard&nbsp;flight software (FSW) architecture used by the Goddard Space Flight Center.

Anxiety-Management Countermeasure](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9rgt-r3c9) - <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
                      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<p>1. Original Project aims/objectives: Stress and anxiety-related
  problems are some of the most common and costly behavioral health
  problems in society. For those working in operational environments
  (i.e., astronauts, flight controllers, military), stress and
  anxiety-related problems before, during, or after missions can
  seriously compromise efficiency, safety, and performance. To address
  behavioral health issues like stress, it is important to maximize the
  privacy, validity, and acceptability of the countermeasures used. Our
  project had two specific aims: 1) to develop an evidence-based,
  autonomous, multimedia program to train users to manage stress and
  build resilience; 2) to evaluate the program in a randomized
  controlled trial (RCT). The program is called SMART-OP (Stress
  Management and Resilience Training for Optimal Performance). The
  six-session cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based program includes
  education about stress, and interactive training exercises that teach
  users to monitor stress, regulate emotions and relax, think flexibly,
  be realistic, and take effective action to deal with stressors. The
  content of the program can be modified to target different populations
  who work in challenging environments (e.g., astronauts, military, and
  flight controllers) and could be disseminated widely via computer,
  tablet, or smartphone. 2. Key Findings: We recently evaluated SMART-OP
  in an RCT with a sample of stressed but otherwise healthy University
  of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Law and Business School students
  (N=66). SMART-OP was compared to an attention control (AC) group that
  received marketed stress management information (i.e., videos and
  reading material). Interested participants were screened to ensure
  they met study eligibility criteria (no medical or psychiatric
  conditions, were stressed based on a self-report stress score, and a
  UCLA graduate student). Two hundred and thirty individuals expressed
  interest in the study, 169 were screened, and 80 were eligible.
  Participants (N = 66) were randomized to SMART-OP or AC and were
  evaluated on self-report measures and performance on The Trier Social
  Stress Test (TSST). Participants also evaluated the program for
  usefulness and usability. Fifty-nine participants completed all
  training sessions and assessments. The SMART-OP group reported
  significantly less stress, more perceived control over stress, and
  rated the program as significantly more useful than the AC group.
  During the TSST, the SMART-OP group showed a more adaptive within-task
  recovery at post-assessment based on a-amylase data (a biomarker of
  stress). SMART-OP received an excellent score on a measure of
  usability. 3. Impact of key findings on hypotheses, technology
  requirements, objectives, and specific aims of the original proposal:
  Our RCT key findings indicate that SMART-OP is highly usable and is a
  more effective and useful stress management training program than an
  educational comparison. These findings support our initial hypotheses
  that the self-guided interactive multimedia stress management and
  resilience training program would be a useful and acceptable method of
  training to the user, and an effective stress management
  countermeasure. Our findings are consistent with the growing
  literature on technology-based behavioral health interventions which
  report that such programs are effective and acceptable forms of
  treatment. SMART-OP only requires a computer for use so it can be used
  confidentially at a time and place of the user's choosing. The program
  can also be modified for use by nearly any population as well as
  tablet or smartphone platforms. We also met our two main aims and
  objectives of our original proposal-- to develop an evidence-based
  autonomous,* [Biosensors for Exploration Medical System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/78hr-6r2q) - The current International Space Station (ISS) ECG (electrocardiogram) system for donning the biomedical sensors is time consuming and inconvenient, requiring shaving, application of electrodes, and signal checks. A more efficient ECG system will save crew time and reduce the overhead of stowing additional supplies. Additionally, the current ECG hardware requires dedicated ISS power and significant volume, but advances in microelectronics has significantly reduced the volume and power required for ECG applications.  The Biosensors-EMSD (Exploration Medical System Demonstration) will demonstrate the integration of small, battery powered, easy to use biomedical sensors and data acquisition devices that will have the ability to measure, store, and transmit physiologic parameters during operational and ambulatory scenarios.    
Specific Aims:     
1. Demonstrate that commercial off the shelf (COTS) and emerging technologies satisfy exploration physiological monitoring requirements and operational requirements    
2. Reduce the time required of an on-orbit crew and ground personnel to store, access, transfer, and process physiological data    
3. Provide a mechanism for interfacing biomedical sensor technology with a common data management framework and architecture to enable the EMSD objectives.    
The functionality of the ECG system will be verified through a ground demonstration and an ISS flight demonstration, both as part of the Exploration Medical System Demonstration.  The project will begin with a market survey of available COTS ECG systems that meet physiological monitoring requirements followed by a direct COTS procurement.  The ECG system will then be tested and verified for proper capabilities by CMO analogs.  Ground testing will require CMO analogs to don the ECG system and execute a series of predetermined tasks while a variety of ECG data and video is collected.  ECG data and video will be examined to ensure data quality, appropriate data routing, and to demonstrate system efficiency.  Flight testing will be similar to ground testing, but may not be as comprehensive given in-flight resource limitations.  The availability of more varied medical condition simulations, more extensive supply of power, fewer time and space limitations, and enhanced system characterization capabilities will allow the ground demonstration to expand the on-orbit objectives by assessing system effectiveness and performance.* [Autonomous Melt-Probe Penetration of Dirty Ice with Clean Sampling for Life Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c7pf-2ivu) - Access to subsurface material and oceans through water-ice crusts is a goal common to exploration of all ocean worlds. Probes that melt their way through ice are, thus far, the only technology demonstrated to penetrate ice autonomously to depths on the order of kilometers, as will be required to reach an ocean on, e.g., Europa. Moreover, melt probes operate in ice at all relevant temperatures, with internal temperatures for electronics and instrumentation near 273K. Such probes are thus strong candidates for subsurface access and life detection on ocean worlds.

However, an ocean worlds melt probe will have to penetrate ice laden with particulates from, e.g., meteoritic or comet dust infall, which accumulate in front of the probe, insulate the melt head, and arrest progress. At the same time, the probe must acquire melt- or ocean-water samples and deliver them without contamination to life-detection instruments. These functions must be accomplished under more severe constraints on power (in foreseeable landed systems) than previous melt probes can meet.

Melt probe power requirements decrease rapidly with decreasing size. We show that a probe with dimensions near those of our small, newly field-tested probe could attain meter-per-hour descent speeds on ocean worlds, even at 100K temperature, using thermal power comparable to that generated radiogenically in a General Purpose Heat Source. Such speeds are sufficient to reach kilometers-deep subglacial water within a nominal 30-day lander life time.

Such an approach would entail major commitments of engineering effort and national resources of plutonium. Precisely because the commitments would be large, it is critical to establish first that essential, component-level functions of subsurface exploration can actually be demonstrated in sufficiently small probes. Primary technical risks on a path to flight hardware therefore entail simplification and size-reduction of hardware to penetrate ‘dirty’ ice, and to acquire ‘clean’ samples for life-detection. The objective of this project is retirement of those risks.

We bring to this work unique experience in each component. Two members of our team have developed a simple, robust probe, which has reached 400 m depth in Greenland and demonstrated penetration rates of 6.6 meters per hour (these are the second-greatest depth and highest speed achieved by melt probes on Earth to date). We have demonstrated autonomous descent based on the geometry and power-balance in our probe, rather than computationally intensive control algorithms. Our third team member has developed and tested in Antarctica a melt-probe based, microbiologically and geochemically clean sampling system, the size and complexity of which we will reduce.

Our specific objectives are thus: (1) to develop a simplified pump and jetting mechanism (currently TRL 3), integrate it with our field-tested melt probe (TRL 4), and to quantify in the laboratory, the characteristics of particle-laden ice that the system can penetrate as a function of jetting parameters; (2) to develop, initially also in the laboratory, clean acquisition and transfer of water samples (currently TRL 3-4 based on Antarctic field experience); and finally (3) to demonstrate dirty ice penetration and clean sampling in an integrated system small enough to be powered radiogenically on ocean worlds, and in a relevant environment (to a depth of 50 m on a dusty alpine glacier in Washington State, with our exit TRL at or approaching TRL 5).

We presently envision the next step toward mission implementation to be testing in ice simulating that on ocean-worlds surface at relevant temperatures. We are in active conversation with the JPL Space Technology Program Office on mission implementation.* [STARwatch to Deliver Objective Sleep Measures for Spaceflight Operations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8frb-eu93) - This project will achieve a wrist-worn actigraphy device called STARwatch, designed specifically for space exploration environments. It will provide a minimally obtrusive, objective measure that evaluates astronaut sleep-wake activity and light exposure. This project will leverage our second generation actigraphy device that has already been validated in controlled laboratory experiments against gold-standard polysomnography. The compact wrist-worn device includes sensors to collect sleep metrics and will also serve as a wireless hub to collect real-time physiological data from other body-worn sensors (e.g., heart rate, EEG). It will use standardized wireless communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth) to automatically uplink data to the ISS network (no astronaut time required). Data will automatically be integrated into medical operations support systems (e.g., BHP-Dashboard) to provide immediate feedback to astronauts and flight surgeons to aid in decision-making relative to astronaut medical, behavioral health and performance issues. During Phase I, we will develop an enhanced STARwatch, integrate data from other body worn sensors (e.g., heart rate sensor), demonstrate automatic data streaming using approaches compatible with the ISS network environment, and develop a plan for operational validation and spaceflight certification that will be implemented during Phase II (Phase I TRL of 4-5).* [Non-Invasive Transcranial Doppler Sonogram Device for Detection of Embolic Air in Cerebral Arteries, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2bpv-jz6p) - Technology is needed to provide real-time assessment and evaluation of hematological parameters during prolong space flights and planetary missions.  A key hematological parameter is the monitoring and measurement of emboli in the brain especially during Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) on planetary surfaces as well as orbital flights. A non-invasive, compact Transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurement device will provide monitoring of flight crew blood physiology during extended duration missions and deliver this data to onboard flight surgeons.  

To address this need, GeneXpress Informatics (GXI) and Leonid Bunegin and Dr. Claudia S. Miller of the University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSC) at San Antonio proposes to develop a non-invasive, portable TCD sonogram based diagnostic system for real-time monitoring and detection of cerebral artery air embolisms.   The detection system uses intensity audio signals and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to detect and locate the TCD audio signals of air bubbles in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). 

In Phase I, GXI proposes to develop and demonstrate the non-invasive use TCD measurements for the determination of air emboli.  In Phase II, GXI will proceed to a prototype development which will include construction and fabrication of a handheld field portable frequency-domain TCD measurement system.* [Drill Embedded Nanosensors for Planetary Subsurface Exploration](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q4uy-cbfr) - <p>We have developed a carbon nanotube (CNT) sensor for water vapor detection under Martian Conditions and the miniaturized electronics can be embedded in the drill bit for collecting sensor data and transmitting it to a computer wirelessly. This capability will enable the real time measurement of ice during drilling. With this real time and in-situ measurement, subsurface ice detection can be easy, fast, precise and low cost.<p/><p>Current methods for sensing icy deposits on Mars or the moon include volume hydrogen measurements in a 1m3 volume from a surface neutron spectrometer, optical spectral measurements to identify water spectral lines, or direct analysis of samples using mass spectroscopy. The latter two methods require samples to be on the surface or fed into an instrument. The detection limit of optical spectroscopy is ~1% water ice in a cuttings mixture. In contrast CNT sensor's detection limit is 10-6 – 10-9 and the sensors are tiny with significantly lower power usage compared to other instruments. The drill mounted CNT sensor can also detect ice as it is encountered by the drill bit at very low concentrations, obtaining fine scale information on the vertical structure of the icy material. Potentially, CNT sensors combined with drilling afford a new approach for detection and measurement of volatiles. With CIF support in 2013, we started with CNT sensors that operate under Earth conditions optimized to sense organic volatiles and developed a CNT sensor capable of detecting water vapor, requiring special coatings applied to the CNT.  We characterized the sensor performance under Mars pressure (~6mbar) and temperature (-45oC) conditions, showing that it could detect small quantities of water vapor introduced into its vicinity. We compared our CNT sensor with commercially available RH sensors. The test results show that commercial sensors do not work under vacuum conditions. So, our CNT sensors exceed the performance of these commercial sensors for Martian conditions.   We miniaturized the sensor, and constructed data acquisition and wireless communication electronics to fit inside a drill string.  The wireless communications allows us to transmit the CNT sensor signal from the borehole without bringing wires through the rotating interface. We then constructed a simulated borehole and drill string and tested sensor performance detecting small quantities of water vapor under Martian conditions. The wireless communication board can transmit the sensor data to a USB receiver plugged into a computer for data streaming. The work remaining is to complete sensor installation into a drill string and test it drilling into icy material in a Mars environment, which requires a Mars chamber that requires use of unique Mars drill testing facilities at Honeybee Robotics.  Possible applications of CNT sensors for water detection include prospecting for buried ice on the Moon, and characterizing feedstocks for ISRU on the moon or Mars.  An ISRU demonstration proposal to the Mars 2020 rover has expressed interest.  CNT borehole instruments that detect volatiles like methane should interest the fuels industry.</p>* [High Efficiency Hybrid Energy Storage Utilizing High Power Density Ultracapacitors For Long Duration Balloon Flights, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gieh-iq9z) - FastCAP proposes to develop an ultra-high power density and high frequency ultracapacitor capable of surviving over the wide temperature range of -60C to 130C and exhibiting peak gravimetric and volumetric power density of 120kW/kg and 150kW/L respectively. FastCAP is planning to design and prototype a hybrid system comprised of the proposed ultracapacitor in parallel with a high energy density, rechargeable, lithium ion battery showing at least 50% volume reduction and 100% lifetime increase compared to stand-alone lithium batteries, meeting long duration research balloon requirements. During Phase I, FastCAP will evaluate both novel under-development and off-the-shelf lithium chemistries utilized in aerospace applications. The resulting hybrid battery-ultracapacitor (HBU) system combines the benefits of both technologies and will meet NASA's scientific balloon requirements of energy density, power density, shelf life, temperature, reliability and cycle life. This ultracapacitor can also be coupled to a piezoelectric generator, thanks to a high cut off frequency greater than 500Hz. The proposed HBU system will enable significant improvements in the design of power storage for terrestrial and planetary balloons, reducing their weight, volume, and complexity, while improving performance and relaxing design constraints on scarce candidate battery technologies. Compared to today's high-rate reserve and rechargeable battery technologies, the proposed hybrid system will provide much higher power and higher energy density, show tremendous improvement in cycle lifetime, and show reduced risk of explosion and thermal runaway associated with high-rate discharge, thanks to the power buffering role of the ultracapacitor within the HBU system. In applications where batteries are currently oversized for power handling, dramatic reductions in total energy storage system weight will be achieved by complementing those batteries with ultracapacitors.* [MOPITT Gridded Daily CO Retrievals (Thermal Infrared Radiances) V006](https://data.nasa.gov/d/emms-45mp) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals. The averaging kernels associated with each retrieval are also gridded and included in the L3 files. For a description of the file contents, refer to the File Spec Document.

These AVHRR data contain two main sets of data: site extracts of SAFARI core sites (Mongu, Etosha, Kasungu, Maun, Skukuza, and Tshane), and regional 15-day composites from sets of single-day images. These AVHRR data contain four main sets of data:1.5 km daily site extracts of SAFARI core sites (2000)1.5 km 15-day composites of SAFARI core sites (1998-2000)1.5 km 15-day composites of the southern African region (Mar, Sept 2000)6 km 15-day composites of the southern African region (1998-2000)The primary data layers for site extracts and regional composites are fire pixel counts and maximum NDVI. The fire product is different for the daily and for the composited products (see readme file) and a fire product is not included in the 1.5 km regional data set.  NDVI composite-associated data layers for the regional data sets include land surface temperature, reflectance, solar zenith angle, view zenith angle, and relative azimuth angle. NDVI composite-associated data layers for the site extracts include these same variables as well as brightness temperature, fire mask composite, latitude, and longitude. The data are stored in binary image format files. There is a metadata file for each site and date/compositing period, in ASCII format.* [Poverty Mapping Project: Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gte3-q924) - The Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition dataset consists of estimates of the 

percentage of children with weight-for-age z-scores that are more than two standard deviations below the median of the NCHS/CDC/WHO 

International Reference Population. Data are reported for the most recent year with subnational information available at the time of 

development. The data products include a shapefile (vector data) of percentage rates, grids (raster data) of rates (per thousand in 

order to preserve precision in integer format), the number of children under five (the rate denominator), and the number of 

underweight children under five (the rate numerator), and a tabular dataset of the same and associated data. This dataset is produced 

by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [PHOBOS 2 MARS TERMOSCAN THERMAL/VISIBLE IMAGING EDR V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n5eg-j4iz) - In February and March, 1989, the Termoskan instrument on board the Phobos '88 spacecraft of the USSR acquired a limited set of very high resolution simultaneous observations of the reflected solar flux (hereafter referred to as the visible channel) and emitted thermal flux (thermal infrared (IR)) from Mars's equatorial region. These are, so far, the highest spatial resolution thermal data ever obtained for Mars. Four slightly overlapping thermal panoramas (also called scans or swaths) cover a large portion of the equatorial region from 30 deg.S to 6 deg.N latitude. Simultaneous visible panoramas were taken during each of the four observing sessions; due to spacecraft memory limitations, visible channel processing was stopped early relative to the thermal channel for 2 of the sessions (2 and 4). Thus, the visible channel panoramas are shorter than the thermal panoramas for these sessions. These data are saved for historical reasons; they are not considered to be of archival quality.* [Distributed Leak Detection System Using Structure-Borne Noise, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jz98-3stw) - Manned spacecraft are vulnerable to air leaks caused by micrometeorite
and space debris impact.  The ability to detect and quickly locate and
mitigate a pressure vessel breach is critical to the safety of any long
duration spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or a
proposed lunar base or mission to Mars.  Current NASA protocol for
finding a spacecraft leak uses a handheld ultrasonic directional
microphone, similar to those widely deployed industrially, to detect the
40 kHz airborne ultrasonic hiss generated by the downstream leak
turbulence.  However, known limitations exist regarding the use of
airborne ultrasonic emissions for locating leaks in the spacecraft
environment because the downstream side of the leak occurs into the
vacuum of space, creating reduced leak noise inside the pressure vessel.
Blockages of the transmission of airborne ultrasonic energy by
structural components, avionics, and equipment racks also limit the
detection range of such systems.  An alternative approach that we
propose is to monitor the spacecraft structure itself---the pressure
vessel skin---for leak-generated surface-borne ultrasound by means of a
flexible and modular electronics package with fully integrated surface
sensor arrays, data acquisition electronics, and radio frequency
communication capabilities.* [Plug Load Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q9cy-stcj) - We provide MATLAB binary files (.mat) and comma separated values files of data collected from a pilot study of a plug load management system that allows for the metering and control of individual electrical plug loads. The study included 15 power strips, each containing 4 channels (receptacles), which wirelessly transmitted power consumption data approximately once per second to 3 bridges. The bridges were connected to a building local area network which relayed data to a cloud-based service. Data were archived once per minute with the minimum, mean, and maximum power draw over each one minute interval recorded. The uncontrolled portion of the testing spanned approximately five weeks and established a baseline energy consumption. The controlled portion of the testing employed schedule-based rules for turning off selected loads during non-business hours; it also modified the energy saver policies for certain devices.

Three folders are provided: “matFilesAllChOneDate” provides a MAT-file for each date, each file has all channels; “matFilesOneChAllDates” provides a MAT-file for each channel, each file has all dates; “csvFiles” provides comma separated values files for each date (note that because of data export size limitations, there are 10 csv files for each date). Each folder has the same data; there is no practical difference in content, only the way in which it is organized.* [Privacy Preservation through Random Nonlinear Distortion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ugj6-i2sw) - Consider a scenario in which the data owner has some private or sensitive data and wants a data miner to access them for studying important patterns without revealing the sensitive information. Privacy-preserving data mining aims to solve this problem by randomly transforming the data prior to their release to the data miners. Previous works only considered the case of linear data perturbations - additive, multiplicative, or a combination of both - for studying the usefulness of the perturbed output. In this paper, we discuss nonlinear data distortion using potentially nonlinear random data transformation and show how it can be useful for privacy-preserving anomaly detection from sensitive data sets. We develop bounds on the expected accuracy of the nonlinear distortion and also quantify privacy by using standard definitions. The highlight of this approach is to allow a user to control the amount of privacy by varying the degree of nonlinearity. We show how our general transformation can be used for anomaly detection in practice for two specific problem instances: a linear model and a popular nonlinear model using the sigmoid function. We also analyze the proposed nonlinear transformation in full generality and then show that, for specific cases, it is distance preserving. A main contribution of this paper is the discussion between the invertibility of a transformation and privacy preservation and the application of these techniques to outlier detection. The experiments conducted on real-life data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.* [LBA-ECO LC-39 MODIS Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gumw-g2hg) - This data set provides active fire locations and estimates of annual fire frequencies for South America from 2000-2007. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm. There are 14 data files with this data set: 7 GeoTIFF (.tif) files of fire frequency at MODIS 250 m resolution, where each grid cell value represents the number of days in that year on which active fires were detected, and 7 shape files of active fire locations for the years 2001-2007.* [IRAS MINOR PLANET SURVEY ASTEROIDS V5.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s5mh-xmjd) - Derived diameters and albedoes of asteroids, plus associated data on sighting and non-sightings, extracted from the IRAS archives.* [SMEX03 AMSR-E Daily Gridded Soil Moisture and Brightness Temperatures, Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2hi7-36tu) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.

This data set contains Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) Level-3 daily measurements of surface soil moisture and vegetation/roughness water content interpretive information, as well as brightness temperatures and quality control variables. Ancillary data include time, geolocation, and quality assessment. Input brightness temperature data, corresponding to a 56 km mean spatial resolution, are resampled to a global cylindrical 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) cell spacing. Data have been spatially subsetted to the SMEX03 study areas in Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA and Brazil. The study period covers 1 April to 31 August 2003 for study areas in the USA and 6 November to 31 December 2003 for the Brazil study area. Total volume for this data set is approximately 70 MB. Data are stored in HDF-EOS format and are available via FTP.

These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data.

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings.

The experiment was conducted from March through July 2003 via the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument on board the European Space Agency's (ESA) Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT). Cross-polarized C-band ASAR images were acquired in order to obtain a backscatter coefficient measurement over a range of natural vegetation types. However, the images provided here are only browse images and therefore cannot be used to derive backscatter coefficient values. Researchers interested in backscatter coefficient values must obtain the ASAR data. The total volume for this combined data set is approximately 65 megabytes. Data are available via FTP and are provided as JPEG image files and JGW georeference files. Also included and available via FTP are the following types of header files: HAN files, ASCII text files, and INI files.

These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data.

A single-axis gasless ACS experiment was successfully flown on a sounding rocket. The single-axis system is being expanded to three axes to provide gasless attitude control with greater accuracy than is presently achievable.</p><p>Sounding rocket payload attitude is currently controlled by a system of cold gas thrusters. The gas released by the thruster has the potential to interfere with science instruments that are sensing matter in the local environment. There is interest in the sounding rocket science community in an ACS that can provide fine attitude control without releasing gas. A three-axis reaction wheel assembly (RWA) can provide gasless fine attitude control during science operations. Large maneuvers and coarse control would still be provided by the standard cold gas thrusters, but the gas would be shut off and control would be handed over to the RWA during portions of the flight critical to sensitive science instruments. In addition to being gasless, a RWA ACS can also provide more precise attitude control than can be achieved through pulsed thrusting of a cold gas system.</p><p>A single-axis gasless ACS proof of concept experiment was flown March 1, 2016.</p><p>The scope of the project is to expand the single-axis system used for the proof of concept flight into a three-axis ACS. Existing software for the controller and software-in-the-loop (SWIL) simulation testing will need to be expanded to include pitch and yaw axes. Maneuver limits and wheel saturation rates with typical disturbances will be estimated to create a trade space of hardware requirements, and hardware that meets those requirements will be identified. Potential processors will be evaluated. Wheels will be sized for the pitch and yaw axes and re-evaluated for the roll axis. Capability for spinning attitude control will also be added. Performance estimates will be made for both the LN-200 and the more accurate LN-251 IRU.</p><p>The overall objective of the project is to mature the three-axis design to the point that it will represent a minimal schedule risk when included in either a Sounding Rocket Program Office (SRPO) development mission or a science mission willing to take a risk on a developmental system, and to develop an accurate cost estimate to aid in securing funding for a flight demonstration. Project deliverables will include controller software for both spinning and non-spinning payloads, a set of hardware requirements for the system, and performance and cost estimates for the system.</p>* [Compact High-Power Widely Tunable Mid-IR Light Source for Planetary Exploration, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hw28-g8cc) - Los Gatos Research, Inc. (LGR) and Professor Martin Fejer and his group at Stanford University propose to develop and demonstrate a compact, monolithic, efficient, high-power, narrow-linewidth tunable laser source operating in the 3.2-3.4 um wavelength region. LGR's mid-infrared (mid-IR) light source, based on a fiber-laser pumped monolithic optical parametric oscillator (OPO) developed at Stanford, will assist NASA in completing its trace-gas-detection objectives by supplying NASA with a critical, difficult-to-obtain laser source suitable for continuous-wave (cw) spectroscopy. During Phase I, LGR and Stanford will manufacture a monolithic OPO crystal, using techniques established by Stanford, generating between 1-2 W of single-frequency radiation between 3.2-3.4 um. At the end of Phase I, the OPO system will be used to measure transmission through a 50-cm-long methane cell (manufactured by LGR) at wavelengths corresponding to the C-H stretch vibrational resonance, 3.3 um. Technology readiness level (TRL) 4 will be reached at the completion of Phase I. During Phase II, remote detection of methane will be performed using a methane cell and measuring the backscattered light from the cell as the OPO mid-IR frequency is scanned ~5 GHz. The size of the housing for the monolithic OPO will be designed to reduce the overall size and weight of the mid-IR-laser head. Fiber-coupling for the incoming pump and the outgoing mid-IR radiation will be added to the OPO housing enabling simple fiber delivery. Modeling of the system sensitivity in ppm of methane will be performed for the final remote sensing system for ground-, air-, and space-based operation.* [Scotch-Tape Mirror for Hard X-rays Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/39pm-6xrw) - <p>The Scotch-Tape Mirror for Hard X-rays project is to test the possibility of building a grazing incidence mirror for hard X-rays (E&gt;20 keV) using a &ldquo;scotch-tape&rdquo; design, in which a thin plastic tape with a specific thickness profile and a multilayer reflective coating is tightly wound into a roll.

Key challenges are (a) to find a suitably smooth tape substrate (this has been done), (b) to wind a large number of tape shells onto the smooth metal centerpiece without introducing and accumulating shape irregularities, and (c) to give the tape the variable thickness profile in order to achieve the desired optical figure. Our immediate goal is to demonstrate the idea feasibility by building a crude conical X-ray concentrator. If successful, we will aim at building and flying a mirror prototype on a balloon and then proposing for an Explorer mission or MOO.

The approach utilizes soft materials to create an extremely dexterous manipulator which can accurately control its pose without use of an external sensor. This enables safe interaction between robotic systems, tools, and humans in cluttered spacecraft. Unlike more conventional robots made out of hard plastics and metals, the robot can be manufactured, expanded, and repaired onboard spacecraft. During launch, the majority of the robot’s materials can be stored as a liquid in jars. When the mission requires a robot, the standardized modules can simply be cast inside a standardized mold, combined with their circuitry, and assembled into the desired configuration. Training of the robot is done in a shape-agnostic fashion, allowing the approach to be applied to arbitrary manipulator configurations, in addition to broader classes of objects including robotic fabrics.* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Aerosol Index Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ycny-j56d) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Aerosol Index Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

The literature sites 83% of astronauts who return from long duration missions lasting longer than one month experience cardiovascular deconditioning while in microgravity conditions; therefore, cardiovascular health will become increasingly important to advance missions outside of low earth orbit (LEO) (e.g. The Journey to Mars). Pressure suits, specifically AGS, are critical to preventing orthostatic intolerance (OI) while performing takeoff, reentry, and landing tasks.  More broadly, pressure suits enable astronauts to maintain homeostasis in vacuum conditions and are required during all extravehicular activities (EVA). Mobility is a critical factor and current limitation to both AGS and Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) designs stemming predominantly from the fact that they are inflated and therefore stiff.  Efforts have been made to revise current gas pressurized pressure suits and replace them with mechanical knit pressure suits, which are garments designed using passive, elastic materials, such as knits (fabrics made of interlooping stretch yarns).  However, mechanical pressure suits are difficult to don/doff and are not able to exert dynamic or controllable pressure on the body.

Active textiles are an emerging area of research that could advance the capabilities of aerospace pressure suit design by contracting on command.  Shape Memory Alloys (SMA), for example, are active materials with pseudoelastic properties and can be engineered to "remember" prescribed forms through an annealing process. Traditional knit architectures can be engineered to produce contraction if individual yarns incorporate SMA wire. Consequently, if a knit garment is constructed using an SMA wire, the garment could dynamically generate large displacements and contractive forces across the fabric surface and could turn on/off or achieve various compression levels. 

Contracting SMA knit technology can be leveraged to compress the body like a braided finger trap, applying tension across a large surface area. An ideal SMA knit used for an active AGS would exhibit a contraction sufficient to generate the required counter-pressure output for AGS/OI applications with minimal elongation because the height of the wearer is a constant. The methods/techniques for designing active SMA knit materials for an AGS design will focus on the assessment of SMA knit samples based on their magnitude of shape change, force generation and pressure output. Voltage, wire gauge, wire diameter, and number of courses containing SMA wire will each be varied to assess their effect on these three variables.  

An SMA knit AGS could provide a controllable, mobile and untethered garment that can create (or relieve) compression on the user.  Leveraging SMA knit technology in compression garment design has a huge potential for improving aerospace pressure suits, which are critical for astronaut health and wellbeing as we transition to a new era in human space exploration.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_ultrarapid](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tuwp-ijme) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data.

The TSP project goals included the acquisition of standardized temperature measurements (snapshots) from all permafrost regions on Earth, preparation of a global data set, and development of maps of contemporary permafrost temperatures. As a result of the project, networks of boreholes, equipped for long-term permafrost temperature observations, were established and consist of approximately 860 boreholes in both hemispheres with more than 25 participating countries. Approximately 350 of the boreholes were drilled and instrumented during the IPY period under various nationally funded projects. Comparison of the current Mean Annual Ground Temperature (MAGT) and historical data allows participating countries and other users to assess the thermal state of permafrost dynamics over the last several decades. The TSP project also included active layer measurements, many of which are observed annually under the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) project. Future plans are for these networks to become part of an international network of permafrost observatories with data available for monitoring and multidisciplinary research in both polar and non-polar permafrost regions.

This data set consists of an inventory of these boreholes in two Excel spreadsheets &mdash; one by country (TSP_Borehole_inventory_countries.xls) and one as a composite (TSP_borehole_inventory_composite.xls) for ease in searching. The spreadsheets include the geographic coordinates of the boreholes, elevation, depth of borehole (BH), year drilled, the MAGT, permafrost (PF) thickness, country, responsible person, affiliation, and sponsors. A summary of the number and type of boreholes by country is provided in a PDF document (N_and_S_hemisphere_borehole_summary.pdf), and a high-resolution JPEG image of the borehole locations (TSP_BoreHoles_location_map_highres.jpg) is also included. The inventory lists boreholes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres with 790 of the boreholes located in the Northern Hemisphere. The inventory primarily concentrates on measurements from new and existing boreholes from 2007 to 2009. For historical purposes, some boreholes active since the 1980s are included. Boreholes are classified as four different types: surface (SU) &lt;10 m, shallow (SH) 10-25 m, intermediate (IB) 25-125 m, and deep (DB) &gt;125 m according to the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) classification. For Antarctica, the surface boreholes are split into two subclasses: &lt;SU (&lt;2 m) and SU (2-10 m). The TSP is a field component of the <a href="http://www.gtnp.org">Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost</a> (www.gtnp.org).

Data from over 500 of these boreholes are presented and discussed in a series of papers in the special IPY - TSP issue of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.v21:2/issuetoc">Permafrost and Periglacial Processes</a> (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.v21:2/issuetoc) that include five regional papers and one synthesis paper.

The instrument is the Scanning Multichannel Microwave
Radiometer (SMMR). Each file consists of one days worth of data in
swath format, i.e. the portion of the Earth's surface viewed by the
scanning radiometer. Antenna temperature data are available from NSIDC
from October 1978 to August 1987.
 SMMR was a ten channel passive microwave instrument using six
conventional Dicke-type radiometers. It delivered orthogonally
polarized antenna temperature data at five frequencies (6.6, 10.69,
18.0 21.0 and 37.0 GHz). The two 37.0 GHz radiometers operated
continuously for each polarization. The other radiometers alternated
polarizations on alternate scans. The size of each daily file is 35 MBytes. The data are distributed on FTP. Copies of the data
format description are available upon request from NSIDC.

The scanner operated only on alternate days, due to spacecraft power
limitations. There are typically at least 14 days of coverage per
month, although major data gaps occur in August: in August, 1982, the
4th, 8th, and 16th are missing for both polar regions; in August,
1984, the 13th through the 23rd are missing for both polar regions.* [Non Thermal Plasma Assisted Catalytic Reactor for CO2 Methanation, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q8n4-4jji) - In situ production of methane as propellant by methanation of CO2, also called Sabatier reaction, is a key enabling technology required for sustainable and affordable human exploration of Mars. The Sabatier reaction is conventionally carried out in a fixed bed catalyst at high temperatures of 350-400 ?C. For the long duration future Mars missions (~ 18 months expected stay on Mars), the fixed bed Sabatier reactor design however is inadequate due to performance and catalyst durability issues. In addition thermal management within the reactor is a major issue due to exothermicity of the reaction. Lynntech has demonstrated the feasibility of a novel low power, low temperature plasma assisted catalysis process for addressing these limitations with the methanation of CO2 at a scale of 14 g/h methane production rate. In the Phase II project, Lynntech proposes to build and demonstrate a full scale (0.55 kg/h methane production rate) Sabatier reactor for NASA application. The anticipated Technology Readiness Level at the beginning and ending of Phase II will be 3 and 4, respectively.* [Use-Driven Testbed for Evaluating Systems and Technologies (U-TEST), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rsud-kchd) - The limitations of current airspace management have necessitated the
planning and development of the Next Generation Air Transportation
System (NextGen). NextGen seeks to change the fundamental structure of
airspace management to increase the safety and efficiency of flight
operations. This effort will require the introduction of advanced flight
deck technologies capable of meeting NextGen requirements, such as
assimilating weather information into navigation displays. To rigorously
evaluate the effectiveness of these new human-machine interface designs,
we propose the Use-driven Testbed for Evaluating Systems and
Technologies (U-TEST). This proposed innovation will provide a platform
for collecting and integrating human performance measures for evaluating
NextGen technologies in simulated environments. At the core of U-TEST
will be a data integration platform that combines multiple data streams
(i.e. observer-based, system-based, and self-report measures), producing
a comprehensive evaluation of pilot performance using novel systems and
technologies. The 3D Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) will
serve as a vehicle for U-TEST development during this SBIR effort.
System engineers can utilize the U-TEST environment to acquire rapid,
comprehensive, and cost-effective feedback to inform the modification of
emerging flight deck systems.* [Real-time Ethylene Sensor Based on Chemical Anisotropic Nanochannel Impedance Spectroscopy, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dx88-8rwt) - NASA has need of a real-time sensor capable of <25ppb detection of ethylene for off-world greenhouse monitoring. NanoLab proposes the use of a fundamentally new style of sensor based off of anisotropic impedance analysis of vertically aligned nanotube arrays (VANTA). Specifically, we propose the use of chemical anisotropic nanochannel impedance spectroscopy (CANIS). This style of sensor provides up to eight degrees of analytical freedom, resulting in extreme discrimination between chemical species without requiring modification of the sensor to provide selectivity. For the particular application of ethylene sensing, NanoLab proposes the use of a carbon nanotube based CANIS sensor, sensitized to improve the interaction of ethylene with the surface, using either a metal or metal organic coating, in order to lower the limit of detection. The sensor will be self-referencing to minimize drift, and will be capable of simultaneously monitoring other relevant species, such as water, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and ammonia without interference to the detection of ethylene. The sensor will be lightweight, and have a footprint of 1cm x 1cm.* [Flow-Angle and Airspeed Sensor System (FASS) Using Flush-Mounted Hot-Films, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jtap-eg39) - Micron-thin surface hot-film signatures will be used to simultaneously obtain airspeed and flow direction. The flow-angle and airspeed sensor system  (FASS) will provide airspeed with practically zero-lag and to less than one knot accuracy and flow angularity to a fraction of a degree, with natural immunity to EMI and RFI. Unlike Pitot-static and other conventional techniques, which experience serious limitations in accuracy, pneumatic lags, and frequency response in thin upper atmospheres, FASS will measure airspeed all the way to zero knots and perform equally well at sea level as well at high altitudes and even in the thin Martian atmosphere. The FASS addresses important flight-operation and flight research problems with crucial impact on vehicle performance, stability & control, structural loads, and pilot action. FASS will permit easy integration with aircraft avionics systems including conventional instruments used for pressure, temperature, and density measurements. Sensor elements will be coated to withstand harsh environment and waterproofed for underwater applications. FASS will be developed and marketed both as a stand-alone device and as an embedded, non-intrusive system. Commercial applications include aerospace vehicles, submarines, ships, boats, atmospheric wind sensing, oceanographic measurements, and tall structures.* [Metrics for Offline Evaluation of Prognostic Performance](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5p2w-8pvp) - Prognostic performance evaluation has gained significant attention in the past few years.*Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part due to the varied end- user requirements for different applications, time scales, available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name a few. The research community has used a variety of metrics largely based on convenience and their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing a standardized approach to compare different efforts. This paper presents several new evaluation metrics tailored for prognostics that were recently introduced and were shown to effectively evaluate various algorithms as compared to other conventional metrics. Specifically, this paper presents a detailed discussion on how these metrics should be interpreted and used. These metrics have the capability of incorporating probabilistic uncertainty estimates from prognostic algorithms. In addition to quantitative assessment they also offer a comprehensive visual perspective that can be used in designing the prognostic system. Several methods are suggested to customize these metrics for different applications. Guidelines are provided to help choose one method over another based on distribution characteristics. Various issues faced by prognostics and its performance evaluation are discussed followed by a formal notational framework to help standardize subsequent developments.* [Low-Stress Iridium Coatings for Thin-Shell X-Ray Telescopes, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8588-yy88) - We propose to develop and commercialize a new type of low-stress iridium
(Ir) X-ray mirror coating technology that can be used for the
construction of high-resolution X-ray telescopes comprising thin-shell
mirror substrates, such as the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) currently
being developed for the Constellation-X mission.  The urgent need for
low-stress Ir coating technology is driven by the current limitations on
telescope angular resolution resulting from substrate distortions caused
by conventional reflective Ir coatings that have high stress.  In
particular, we have measured film stresses in excess of 3 GPa in the
case of 30 nm Ir films deposited by conventional magnetron sputtering
techniques.  The distortions in thin glass mirror shells (such as those
suitable for the Constellation-X SXT) resulting from these extremely
large coating stresses presently make the largest contribution to the
SXT telescope imaging error budget, of order 10 arcsec or more.
Consequently, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to meet the
imaging requirements of Constellation-X, or other future high-resolution
X-ray missions, unless high-quality Ir coatings having significantly
lower stresses can be developed.  The development of such coatings is
precisely the aim of our proposal.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Time Average 1-hourly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sh9r-winy) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

The proposed sensor builds on previous liquid hydrogen sensor development successes and patents.  It can be utilized to measure cryogenic propellants, and sub-critical cryogenic fluids in use on a wide range of space applications and in ground applications to monitor fluids ranging from liquid oxygen to MMH and N2O4.  The LMG can also indicate the presence of contaminants such as nitrogen used to purge the system. The current methods use either wire resistance measurements, capacitance or point sensors, combined with pressure and temperature measurements.  The LMG will be lighter, require less energy to operate, and provide less heat leak than existing technologies. Current techniques will not function correctly in boiling or stratified liquid cryogens or in reduced gravity. During phase I, Proof-of Concept experiments will be performed with liquid oxygen. Commercial applications in the home health care industry have been identified.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Time Average 1-hourly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ggat-viws) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present.

This innovation will allow spacecraft to navigate autonomously, precisely and safely from entry-interface to near-landing. 

The plan is to develop automated techniques suitable for onboard software that incorporate recognized objects from imagery data into the vehicle's navigated solution. We will use image processing techniques to compare the imagery with expected views, pattern recognition techniques to identify known objects in the comparison, mechanisms for locating known objects using the navigated state, and filtering techniques to update the navigated state with the errors between the observed and expected results. To qualify as flight software, the proposed solution will be reliable and verifiable, and will satisfy limitations of the onboard equipment. No existing techniques solve all of these problems. Current techniques for incorporating imagery data into navigated solutions use sensors that have significantly shorter ranges, rely on registration markers placed on the target, use ground-based computational equipment, or require human intervention to arrive at a solution.* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 Total Column Ozone Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nwi9-mstf) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 Total Column Ozone Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

This proposal concerns a technology to simultaneously reduce the microbial count (MC) and total organic carbon (TOC) content of biological water processor (BWP) effluent. This technology is based on an advanced oxidation process using an on-demand oxidizer generator, which does not require consumable chemicals. Phase I feasibility studies successfully demonstrated the efficacy of the process for the reduction of both TOC and MC of the BWP processed water. Independent evaluation of the technology at a well known technological university successfully demonstrated the efficacy of the process for minimizing the RO membrane fouling. The residual disinfectant and reduced TOC in the treated effluent minimize fouling the RO membrane and water lines. In addition, reduced TOC lowers the load on equipment downstream to the BWP, enabling a reduction in the equivalent system mass. In the Phase II project, a prototype will be fabricated and evaluated for its ability to reduce TOC, MC and extend RO membrane life in a technological university having a small scale water reclamation system similar to that at NASA-JSC. The GEN I unit developed will be delivered to NASA-JSC.* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/85yv-vq83) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard 

total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and 

volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. 

(2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined 

using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational 

GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per 

grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional 

economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the 

range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is 

generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia 

University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and 

Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Improved Forecasting of Solar Particle Events and their Effects on Space Electronics, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a3yx-miyc) - High-energy space radiation from Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events (SPEs) pose significant risks to equipment and astronaut health in NASA missions. Energetic particles from SPEs associated with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may adversely affect not only beyond-Low-Earth-Orbit missions, but also aircraft avionics, communications, and airline crew/passenger health. It is crucial to develop a capability to forecast SPEs and their effects on systems to guide planning of mission-related tasks and risk mitigation strategies.
CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC), University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), and Vanderbilt University (VU) propose to develop a comprehensive forecasting capability - SPE Forecast (SPE4) - comprising state-of-the-art modules integrated within a novel computational framework. SPE4 will include: (a) the MAG4 code for probability forecasts of flares/CMEs, and SPEs, (b) the PATH code for solar particle transport through the heliosphere, (c) Geant4-based transport calculations including geomagnetic modulation and atmospheric interactions (for avionics) to yield spectra of SPE-induced energetic protons/heavy ions, interfaced to (d) the CR?ME96 code for calculation of resulting effects in electronics. 
In Phase I, we demonstrated the superior capability of MAG4, PATH, and Geant4 for their respective tasks using a prior solar event case. A controller script was developed for automated code execution and data transfer across interfaces. Functionality of the overall event-to-effects capability was demonstrated using the 28-Sep-2012 event. We developed a concept of the final software product for NASA based on client-server architecture. In Phase II, we will collaborate with VU to interface calculated particle spectra with CR?ME96 to determine single-event effects in electronics. We will enhance robustness, accuracy, and execution speed via improved models and procedures, and demonstrate the software for persistent 24x7 SPE monitoring.* [Advanced Propeller Flow Control for Increased Propulsive Efficiency, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9ty6-qh4z) - An important mission for NASA is the development of revolutionary flight concepts and technology.  The development of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), the resurgence of general aviation, and growing interest in environmentally conscious, all-electric, emissionless aircraft have brought about a renewed interest in propeller design.  Overall, since the propeller's golden age during the WWII era, very little has changed in propeller design.  Computers have automated the design processes, but the basic design methodology, from an aerodynamic point of view has changed very little.  Strides have been made in acoustics and multidisciplinary optimization (MDO), but the basic aerodynamic design and performance of the subsonic propeller has basically remained unchanged.  The explosion of UAVs and a need for more efficient designs allowing greater payload, range, and loiter times have taken UAVs from simple cut-and-try designs to sophisticated, aerodynamically efficient systems.  An area as of yet not fully exploited by this class of aircraft, is that of propeller efficiency.  Most smaller UAVs and micro-UAVs simply use off-the-shelf radio control propellers, while moderate size UAVs rely on propellers designed using classical blade element theory or those derived for general aviation aircraft.  While these propellers provide industry acceptable levels of thrust for a given torque, the majority of propellers suffer some form of flow separation.  The extent of flow separation can range from small areas in cruise regions of the flight envelope, to large areas during climb and wind milling.  Significant propeller performance gains in the form of increased thrust and reduced torque can be obtained by eliminating these separated regions across the flight envelope.  A simple, efficient, and robust flow control technique is proposed to eliminate these separated regions and provide a marked increase in propeller performance and vehicle propulsive performance.* [Broadband Phase Shifter for High Contrast Nulling Interferometry](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g2zw-psnk) - <p>All approaches to starlight suppression are subject to spectral bandpass limitations. For nulling interferometers (&ldquo;nullers&rdquo;), the issue lies in achieving broadband symmetry between destructively interfering beams. In this effort we propose to improve upon the use of Fresnel rhombs as achromatic phase shifters (APS) for broadband high contrast nulling interferometry by adding dielectric coatings to each rhomb. These components will be characterized along with a fiber bundle spatial filter array (SFA) that is used for complex wavefront control.&nbsp; These components (the APS and SFA) are used in parallel to ultimately reach contrasts needed for Earth-like exoplanet detection.</p><p>The objectives of this project include 1) designing and tolerancing a new set of coated Fresnel rhomb APS that will, in theory, improve broadband peformance by over two orders of magnitude compared to a previous generation set of APS, 2) procuring one or more symmetric sets of APS and fabricating new mounting hardware, and 3) measuring and verifying the performance of the APS. The end goal or product is to produce an enhanced set of optics that improve the performance of the current, uncoated APS rhombs by two to three orders of magnitude, for use in testing with future demonstrations of the Segmented Aperture Interferometric Nulling Testbed (SAINT), which uses the Visible Nulling Coronagraph (VNC) for high-contrast source suppression. This is a technology maturation effort for missions such as the Habitable Exoplanet Imager (HabEx) or a future large aperture UV/Optical/IR telescope (LUVOIR) Surveyor.&nbsp; The innovative elements include a fabrication scheme that yields symmetric optics, and a test regiment that can measure prism angles with sub-arcsecond precision and retardance to micro-radian precision.</p>* [Highly Durable Catalysts for Ignition of Advanced Monopropellants, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/waen-wphd) - Monopropellants are readily ignited or decomposed over a bed of solid catalyst. A serious limitation of existing catalysts in the ignition of advanced monopropellants is limited thermal stability.* [An Optical Wake Vortex Detection System for Super-Density Airport Operation, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qg4y-r8th) - Feasibility study including analysis and experiment performed in Phase I indicated that several singled-ended optical scintillometer and retro-reflector pairs installed on towers or poles are able to develop a vertical profile of near ground atmospheric turbulence and wind measurements in airport environment.  In Phase II, OSI proposes to design, fabricate and test a prototype optical vertical profile system for atmospheric turbulence and crosswind measurements to provide critical atmospheric parameters for wake vortex decaying forecasting modeling.  Several scintillometers will be built with the goal to demonstrate their ability to meet performance, size, weight, and packaging requirements for airport operations. An analytical and field test program will be conducted for further performance improvement of a vertical profile vortex detection system using optical scintillometers to measure near ground level crosswind, turbulence, and wake vortex on an airfield.  The results of  near ground vortex measurements plus the ground vortex measurements by double-ended optical scintillometers will provide the necessary assessment to design a crosswind, turbulence, and vortex detection system as a decision support tool for NASA's Airspace Systems (AS) Program to improve airport capacity and safety.
 
The vortex detection system could also measure downdraft on the runway. The instrument will provide real-time continuous measurements of convergence and divergence along the runway. Vertical winds, and hence the downdraft, can be derived from the measured divergence. The proposed vortex detection system will also be able to provide critical large area wind information. By incorporating this valuable information into the low-level wind shear modeling, it will greatly enhance the performance of the present airport low-level wind shear systems.* [LBA Regional Monthly Climatology for the 20th Century (New et al.)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a96f-tk2i) - This data set is a subset of "Global Monthly Climatology for the 20th Century (New et al.)" (2000a). This subset characterizes mean monthly surface climate over the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., latitude 10 N to 25 S, longitude 30 to 85 W) during nearly all of the 20th Century. The data are gridded at 0.5-degree latitude/longitude resolution and include seven variables: precipitation, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure, cloud cover, and ground-frost frequency. All variables have mean monthly values for the period 1901-1995, several have data as recent as 1998, and further data will be added by the data originators. In constructing the monthly grids, the authors used an anomaly approach that attempts to maximize station data in space and time (New et al. 2000b). In this technique, grids of monthly historic anomalies are derived in relation to a standard normal period. Station measurement data for the years 1961-1990 were extracted from the monthly data holdings of the Climatic Research Unit and the Global Historic Climatology Network (GHCN) and used in constructing the normal period (New et al. 1999). The anomaly grids were then combined with high-resolution mean monthly climatology to arrive at fields of estimated historical monthly surface climate. Data are in ASCII GRID format for ArcInfo. Information on creating this LBA subset is available in ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/physical_climate/GIS_EastAngliaClimateMonthly/comp/eastanglia_readme.pdf.Data users are encouraged to see the companion file New et al. (2000) for a complete description of this technique and potential applications and limitations of the data set. For additional information, refer to the IPCC Data Distribution Centre.To access the complete year-by-year monthly data set or data more recent than posted here, users may make a request with the Climate Impacts LINK Project at the Climatic Research Unit (e-mail: d.viner@uea.ac.uk; web site: www.cru.uea.ac.uk/link). LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system. More information about LBA can be found at http://www.daac.ornl.gov/LBA/misc_amazon.html.* [High Performance Ka-band Phase Shifters for Space Telecommunications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/krkw-7x7d) - We propose a novel MEMS-based digital phase shifter targeted for Ka-band operation, but scalable down to X-band and up to W-band.  This novel phase shifter will incorporate MEMtronics' state-of-the-art microencapsulated, capacitive MEMS switches to control phase.  The envisioned phase shifter behaves much like a switched-line phase shifter with broadband matched impedance, but without sacrificing size normally needed to accommodate multiple signal paths.  Many MEMS-based phase shifters have been created with good results utilizing a loaded line approach.  While this technique works well for smaller bits, larger bits suffer from narrow bandwidths and a poor impedance match in one or both states.  Additionally, cascading multiple bits results in a relatively long multi-bit phase shifter.  As insertion loss is dominated by conductor loss, these long multi-bit phase shifters become rather lossy reducing advantages that MEMS-based phase shifters may offer.  This proposed project seeks to overcome these limitations by maximize phase shift per unit length, while increasing bandwidth, to arrive at a low-loss Ka-band phase shifter with significant performance and size improvements over currently available technologies.* [Health-Management Driven Control Reconfiguration Approach for Flight Vehicles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/we93-gkx5) - A prognostic system makes it possible to anticipate loss of functionality before it occurs with sufficient lead time to take actions that mitigate the impact of this loss. We focus on the forms of mitigation within the flight vehicle that influence the operational dynamics but do not directly amend the mission plan. Thus, we focus upon the reconfiguration of the feedback control strategy for the flight system.

The high degree of complexity in the design and dynamics of modern aircraft is typically handled using a hierarchical control scheme in which there are several levels of control at increasing levels of responsibility: the component level, the subsystem level, and the system level. Our reconfiguration strategy involves mitigating problems that are detected at the component level at both the level in which the fault is detected and higher levels as well. There are, thus, two subproblems to the reconfiguration: (a) an adaptive control problem at the lower level to extend component life and derive new component performance limits, and (b) a supervisory control problem at the higher level to adapt the system controller to maximize system capability while respecting the performance limitations. Since our reconfiguration occurs in the context of a dynamic system, we need to respect the stability implications of the reconfiguration. To address this, we apply bandwidth analyses at the component level and the systems level in a robust performance context. A conservative criterion for stability is to impose rate limits for reconfiguration that insure that undesired, and possibly unmodeled, modes of behavior are not driven by reconfiguration activities. For specific hardware, extensions beyond this conservative approach may be warranted (e.g. to catch faulty behavior) and validated on a case-by-case basis, essentially by extending the component modeling to include a model of behavior under certain types of reconfiguration.* [A Network of Multi-band Sensors for Radar Design, Deployment, and Diagnostics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mbs4-dctp) - Limitations on the design, monitoring and diagnosis of complex microwave systems due to insufficient models, the reality of imperfect physical conditions, and the reliance on trial-and-error iteration for system improvement serve to increase the time and costs of radar development. While microwave characterization is traditionally the realm of conventional, port-based measurements, the proposed concept suggests an alternative: the development of a novel network of electro-optic sensors that probe the near-field amplitude and phase of microwave signals at strategic locations within prototype or field-deployed radar systems. Such a sensor network, which would rely on optically-coupled, non-conductive, ultrawideband probes, would provide an unprecedented combination of negligible invasiveness, freedom from electrical interference, and the ability to capture signal information at frequencies from UHF to W-band. It would impact the development of virtually the entire range of technologies relevant to active microwave earth-science instruments. The proposed program will thus lead to the development of an instrument that can aid in areas such as deployment, calibration, and phase correction in large arrays, as well as in the identification of sources of electromagnetic-interference signals and the isolation of faults and failures.* [Advanced Long-Range Video Capabilities Using Speckle Imaging Techniques, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u93d-scvb) - Flight-testing is a crucial component in NASA's mission to research and develop new aeronautical concepts because it allows for verification of simulated and wind-tunnel experiments and exposes previously unforeseen design problems. Video is an invaluable tool for flight-testing, allowing the collection of a wealth of information such as craft position, speed, health, as well as tracking different phases of flight, capturing events, extracting performance figures, and documenting historical flights.  For several cases of interest (high-speed/high-altitude aircraft, lakebed remote landings, vehicle re-entry, smoke airflow traces, etc.) it is not feasible or physically possible to install external cameras close to the aircraft whose behavior is being filmed.  Long-range imaging equipment is typically used in these cases, but the captured footage is severely limited in quality by atmospheric effects, which are often the dominating source of image degradation, long before diffraction-related limitations occur.  In consequence, long-range imagery typically suffers from scintillation, blurring, poor spatial resolution, and low contrast.  Since these problems result from atmospheric conditions, they cannot be overcome by simply improving imaging hardware.  What is needed is a solution to combat atmospheric distortion.  In Phase I, EM Photonics demonstrated a signal processing technique based on initial research from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  We modified and implemented this core algorithm and showed its ability to enhance imagery collected from the long-range imaging systems at NASA DFRC.  In Phase II, we will evolve and integrate the prototype components developed in Phase I and deliver an image enhancement device capable of running in real time to mitigate the image distortion present in data collected from NASA DFRC's long-range cameras.* [An Electrochemical, Point-of-Care Detector for Reagent-free, In-situ Diagnostics of Pathogens, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6jdu-dp48) - For long-term exploratory space travel, there will be a critical need for in-situ diagnosis and assessment of biological specimens from symptomatic astronauts, especially, disease pathogens (virus, bacterium, or fungus) and microbial contaminants. Hence, a real-time, non-culture-based microbial detection, identification and quantification system for on-flight monitoring and evaluation of pathogens from astronauts, or the space environment, is strongly desired. The success of such diagnostic tasks critically depends upon the degree of automation and reliability of such trace level detection. To meet this need, we propose to develop a novel miniaturized, point-of-care (POC) detector for reagent-free, no-culturing, in-situ diagnostics of disease pathogens. The envisioned device will be compact, lightweight, fully integrated and automated (requiring minimum human intervention), and highly cost-effective and power-efficient. In Phase I, we will develop a new type of electrochemical molecules and fabricate solid electrode-based probe for in-vitro demonstration of accurate and effective signal transduction of selective binding of pathogenic cells to the electrode as proof-of-principle. In Phase II, the electrode probe will be optimized to increase specificity, sensitivity, stability, and the response to regular biological samples. Finally, the sensor will be integrated with a compact handheld instrument for data collection, analysis and processing and interfacing with existing NASA space instrumentation for both terrestrial and microgravity environments evaluation.* [In-Situ / In-Flight Detection of Fluorescent Proteins Using Imaging Spectroscopy Sensors, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3nc7-ixfn) - The proposal addresses technologies relevant to NASA's new Vision for Space Explorations in the areas of robotics, teleoperations, and macro and micro imaging systems, while developing a generic biology research facility.

In order to carry out NASA's new vision of exploration and prepare for eventual human presence beyond Low Earth Orbit and on the surface of the Moon, Mars, and beyond, we must collec-tively understand how life and specific biological systems adapt, respond, and thrive in these unique environments.  Planning for extended human presence in the reduced gravity environ-ments of the Moon and Mars will require a solid biological understanding from the sub-cellular to the whole organism level.

The proposed facility supports space-based technologies that enable cross-species comparative biological research and will include in-situ autonomous capability to extract genetic, genomic, proteomic, and metabolic information while providing tools to utilize and interpret such data.  Of critical importance is the incorporation and utilization of these monitoring and control systems that will successfully accommodate and adapt to the changing needs of biological systems or specimens over long periods of time.

The facility will be the first scientific payload equipped with automated in-situ technology that allows detection and analysis of fluorescence, which is crucial to the fundamental understanding of biological properties of cellular, sub-cellular, and whole organisms during exploration of space and planets.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Diurnal (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/syde-jkqp) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

  The MERRA-Land product, MSTUNXMLD or tavgU_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional diurnal at the native resolution. All collections from this group are at reduced horizontal resolution. 
  
    The data are on the GEOS-5 native 540 x 361 grid with 2/3&deg; longitude x 1/2&deg; latitude resolution. Data are archived in the HDF-EOS (Grid) format, based on HDF4.* [Evaluating Algorithm Performance Metrics Tailored for Prognostics](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jxd7-h83f) - Prognostics has taken center stage in Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) where it is desired to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a system so that remedial measures may be taken in advance to avoid catastrophic events or unwanted downtimes. Validation of such predictions is an important but difficult proposition and a lack of appropriate evaluation methods renders prognostics meaningless. Evaluation methods currently used in the research community are not standardized and in many cases do not sufficiently assess key performance aspects expected out of a prognostics algorithm. In this paper we introduce several new evaluation metrics tailored for prognostics and show that they can effectively evaluate various algorithms as compared to other conventional metrics. Four prognostic algorithms, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Polynomial Regression (PR), are compared. These algorithms vary in complexity and their ability to manage uncertainty around predicted estimates. Results show that the new metrics rank these algorithms in a different manner; depending on the requirements and constraints suitable metrics may be chosen. Beyond these results, this paper offers ideas about how metrics suitable to prognostics may be designed so that the evaluation procedure can be standardized.* [Distributed Rocket Engine Testing Health Monitoring System, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tfxc-qk4s) - Leveraging the Phase I achievements of the Distributed Rocket Engine Testing Health Monitoring System (DiRETHMS) including its software toolsets and system building blocks, the Phase II project seeks a comprehensive prototyping of the technology. Phase II not only expands the functionality and applications of the Phase I achievements, but utilizes evolving diagnostics due to the advanced intelligent algorithms built on AGNC's Optimized Neuro-Genetic Fast Estimator (ONGFE) framework. In this way, the Phase II effort culminates in a product that is able to adapt to unknown operating conditions and learn new failures in an unsupervised way. Additionally, a major effort consists of providing a novel, robust, and embedded software toolset for sensor Failure Detection and Identification (FDI): Sensor Data Validation and Self-Healing Scheme (SDV-SHS). To increase the commercialization potential and market values of the NASA and non-NASA applications, the Phase II project adapts DiRETHMS to the market requirements. The work in Phase II along with a modular architecture and standardization ensures a solid integration with NASA's Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) for enhanced health monitoring.* [Application of Advanced Electromagnetic Arrays to High Efficiency, High Bandwidth, Redundant Linear Actuators, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/iv52-hair) - There is a need to develop electromechanical actuators to improve
performance beyond that of hydraulic devices currently being used in
numerous aerospace and industrial applications. Beginning with NASA-provided performance specifications, this Phase I SBIR effort has employed a systems approach to develop and optimize the design of an electromechanical linear actuator appropriate for demanding launch vehicle thrust vector and control surface applications. The actuator system design consists of a high-efficiency permanent magnet motor with redundant current channels for system fault tolerance, multiple high-bandwidth controllers that are matched to motor characteristics, and a compact roller-screw mechanism, along with housing and supporting elements. A system of innovations was necessary to overcome the inherent limitations of today's electromechanical actuators, which were developed based on the limitations of traditional motors, power electronics, and available actuator hardware. The projected weight of the actuator prototype to be built in Phase II is less than the existing hydraulic systems currently in use by NASA, and half of previous electric prototypes having the same performance specification. Working with a major aerospace company partner, the Phase II Team will deliver a tested prototype actuator system as a basis for future advanced commercial products.* [Temperature-Modulated Radiative Coatings for Dynamic Thermal Management of Spacecraft](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y72a-666f) - During the course of its mission, a spacecraft is often exposed to significant thermal cycling. Hardware components, such as batteries, transmitters, etc. will only operate within a comparatively smaller range of temperatures. Therefore a thermal management system (TMS) must be developed to maintain the spacecraft's temperature at an operable level throughout the mission. One function of the TMS is to regulate the spacecraft's radiative heat transfer with the environment. Passive radiation coatings are a desirable way to achieve this since they require no electrical input and typically add a negligible amount of mass.

This proposal discusses wavelength-selective, temperature-modulated multilayer coatings which can be used to control the radiative heat transfer between the environment and the spacecraft. If the spacecraft's temperature is too high, the radiation coating can help to reduce the temperature through enhanced thermal emission by selectively emitting in the mid-infrared. Conversely, if the spacecraft temperature is too low, a highly reflective radiation coating can prevent further temperature decrease by minimizing thermal loss. The proposed coatings will combine both functionalities to provide temperature-modulated variable emissivity and improved thermal control. The temperature-modulated properties are achieved through the incorporation of a thermochromic transition material, vanadium dioxide. Currently a Fabry-Perot resonance cavity provides the wavelength-selectivity of the design, however other structures such as nanoparticle layers, gratings, and nanopillars, will be investigated. Alternative tunable materials, such as graphene or other transition materials, will also be explored.

This multifaceted proposal covers four areas: coating design, sample fabrication and characterization, metrology development, and device level testing. A general methodology to analyze and optimize multilayer radiation coatings that incorporate a thermochromic transition material has already been defined and used to model the radiative properties of several preliminary structures. Likewise, development of the metrology systems needed to characterize the samples' radiative properties, including an all-in-one cryogenic-to-high-temperature spectroscopic platform, is in progress. Variable emissivity coatings will be fabricated, characterized, tested at the systems level, and iteratively improved to deliver a dynamic radiative coating which has the potential to significantly advance NASA's exploratory mission capabilities. The findings of this research would address the TA14.2 space technology roadmap objective.* [SEDIMENT ANALYSIS NETWORK FOR DECISION SUPPORT (SANDS) LANDSAT GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF AL (GSA) ANALYSIS V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6cjq-rekr) - The Geological Survey of Alabama (GSA) analyzed changes in the coastal shoreline and sedimentation using Landsat geotiff images as part of the Sediment Analysis Network for Decision Support (SANDS) project.  The daytime geotiffs images from Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 were analyzed for sediment re-distribution after a hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Alabama and part of the Florida area having coordinates 31 to 27 North latitude and 90 to 84.25 West longitude.  These are seasonal data for storms from 2001-2008.  In addition to the analyzed files, the data files include the ESRI files for zipped bands and grids, metadata, and storm temporal information for the sediment analysis images.* [Sensitive, selective nanoantenna-based biosensor platform for compact, in-situ exo-life detection and astronaut life support](https://data.nasa.gov/d/amf9-x5gb) - We aim to develop a new nanotechnology-enabled sensing platform exceeding the sensitivity and selectivity of the current state-of-art (SOA) in portable, low-mass, low-complexity biochemical sensors. This system is a new capability for space exploration/science applications, e.g. exo-life detection in challenging cryogenic environments, including multiplexed arrays in planetary probes, distributed sensor swarms for use with CubeSats, and other platforms, and builds upon our existing efforts at both NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and Dartmouth College.  

Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) – the collective electron oscillations excited in nano-sized metallic particles (‘nanoantennas’) by incident optical light – have been utilized extensively as sensitive, label-free optical probes for the study of biochemical interactions in both gas and liquid phase, due to their highly confined electric fields and extreme sensitivity to changes in their local environment (e.g. the presence of a target biomolecule.)  The ultimate limit of detection – single molecule detection – has been demonstrated with such sensing platforms, and will form the basis of our sensing approach. Yet, the selective capture of rare targets from a complex background near these transducers remains both a challenging problem and necessary step to advance this technology out of the lab and into the field. Therefore, we aim to close this critical knowledge gap in the current proposal, through the development of the tailored nano-recognition elements coupled to sensitive plasmonic nanoantennas. We will primarily focus on exo-life applications – as these are currently the most challenging and least understood – but with further application to astronaut life support, pathogen detection, and water quality monitoring.  

Field-deployable LSPR-based sensors are currently being explored for terrestrial point-of-care (POC) medical applications by other groups, including our external collaborator for this award at Dartmouth College. These devices are also conducive to the demanding requirements of space exploration, owing to their low-mass, volume, and power consumption, and ruggedization/simplicity in operation. Further, their small size, and relatively low cost with high sensitivity provide capabilities not possible with larger, more complex, centralized instruments (e.g. mass spectrometer). However, LSPR-based sensors (and mass spectrometers) are limited in their demonstrated ability to selectively capture and uniquely identify the target analytes in-situ (in possibly challenging environments), with minimal processing/contamination. This proposal is aimed at enabling this critical step towards a new class of chemical/biochemical measurements for space exploration applications.  

The goal is to advance the SOA in selective capture and sensitive detection of rare biomarkers in-situ, using small, portable, deployable biosensor platforms, with a particular focus on exo-life detection, and possible extension/application to in-flight astronaut life support (including water quality monitoring, health diagnostics, and pathogen detection).* [Using Real-Time Lexical Indicators to Detect Performance Decrements in Spaceflight Teams: A Methodology to Dynamically Monitor Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Mechanisms That Influence Performance](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5p2z-bpjx) - To date, we have collected data from HERA Campaign 1 (C1M1 – C1M4), HERA Campaign 2 (C2M1 – C2M4), and NEEMO18. The Year 1 effort was to conduct a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in the Year 1 HERA analogs. This was accomplished, demonstrating that (a) lexical measures can distinguish between high stress and nominal stress in HERA, (b) these measures are consistent with traditional pen and paper measures of stress, and (c) they show sensitivity to variations in stress levels. However, it is important to note that our goal in this project is to develop and test a lexical analysis tool that is tailored for, and optimized to, the LDSF (long duration space flight) environment, rather than simply apply an existing lexical analysis program. That is, we proposed to develop a lexical analysis tool, STRESSnet, that is specifically tailored to assess stress effects in the LDSF environment. This requires that we base this tool on a comprehensive model of the stress domain that draws on existing theory on stress, performance, and well-being, and that we incorporate terms drawn from the existing spaceflight corpus.     
In Year 1, at the direction of the project sponsors, we had to shift our focus immediately to testing a preliminary version of STRESSnet in HERA1 to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Thus, the methodological development of the STRESSnet tool was accelerated to meet this schedule, resulting in a quickly-composed scale that was suitable for testing.     
In Year 2, we are able to perform the more detailed, iterative tasks that are required for the development of the STRESSnet dictionaries. Therefore, there are two primary YR2 tasks that were performed: (1) Data collection and analysis of HERA C2M1 – C2M4 (analyses are still ongoing). (2) Tool revision and elaboration to derive the STRESSnet lexical dictionaries. This report focuses on the tool development task. The products of this task are the searchable dictionaries of lexical terms to assess stress and related states.     
To derive these dictionaries, we first developed a comprehensive model of stress, performance, and well-being. Guided by this model, we derived five major stress dimensions to be examined (attentional focus, cognitive load, anxiety, negative emotion, and social impairment), as well as a number of sub-facets within each core dimension. To develop lexical measures for each sub-facet (such as sadness), we first scavenged existing sources (available scales, questionnaires, existing lexical dictionaries, as well as reviewing Johnson Space Center (JSC) mission transcripts) to develop an initial inventory of terms reflecting that sub-facet or construct. We then initiated a series of iterative ratings of these word lists in order to include additional relevant terms and exclude irrelevant terms.* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k86t-awrb) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard 

total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and 

volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. 

(2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined 

using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational 

GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per 

grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional 

economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the 

range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is 

generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia 

University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and 

Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Superconducting Resonant Inductive Power Coupling, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e5by-xv3f) - The proposed effort will develop a technology to wirelessly and efficiently transfer power over hundreds of meters via resonant inductive coupling.  The key innovation of this approach is the use of dielectricless high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils to overcome the limitations in efficiency and range of existing solutions.  This approach is informed by existing research models that predict a nominal application of this technique is capable of delivering 100 Watts of power at a distance of 100 meters with over 90% efficiency.  A notional application of the technology is to deliver power to rovers exploring the inside of craters at the Lunar poles, where solar power is not available.  The naturally low temperatures would eliminate the need for thermal control overhead on the rover, allowing the system to be charged from a completely unenergized state or powered directly.  Multiple rovers could be powered by the same transmission system and there would be no pointing requirements for operation.  The phase I effort will demonstrate efficient wireless power transfer using superconducting wires as a proof of concept (TRL 3-4), which will be integrated with existing thermal control technology (TRL 4) into a working prototype (TRL 6) at the end of Phase II.* [SMEX03 ALMNet and SCAN Soil Moisture Data: Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a4rg-d69s) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.

This data set includes soil moisture, precipitation, and soil temperature data measured during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03), conducted during June and July 2003 in northern Alabama and southern Tennessee, USA.  The output parameters include precipitation as well as soil temperatures and volumetric soil moisture at depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 100 cm. Data were collected at crop, pasture, and forested sites located within the Alabama MesoNet (ALMNet) network.

AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.* [SMEX03 ALMNet and SCAN Soil Moisture Data: Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4xne-fhap) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC.

Unfortunately, they are limited in terms of their heat flux capability, approximately 5W/cm2.  Incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2.  This is a severe limitation for axial groove (CCHP) as well as loop heat pipes (LHP).  Standard CCHPs are also not suitable for Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, since they can only operate with a very small adverse elevation, on the order of 0.10 inch.  Landers can have tilts of ±20<SUP>o</SUP>, while rovers can have tilts of ±45<SUP>o</SUP>.  As a result, a wick with a higher heat flux capability and pumping capability is required.  This program will develop heat pipes with both 1) Sintered wicks, and 2) Hybrid grooved and sintered wicks.  Heat pipes with both wick designs will be capable of operating at heat fluxes in the ten's of watts per cm2, and in Lunar or Martian environments at large slopes against gravity.  An all-sintered wick will be used when the entire heat pipe must be able to operate against gravity, while a hybrid wick will be used when the condensers will always be gravity aided on the planetary surface.* [High Rate Tellecommunications for Mars Planetary and Proximity Ranges and other Deep-Space Missions-A, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2kcq-75gq) - Space vehicles for deep space exploration rely on microwave and millimeter wave links for communication with earth stations. As the mission of space probes expands, the data rate to be transmitted increases, and effective, compact, methods of modulating the RF carrier with high-speed data become a critical necessity.  Passive MMIC modulation approaches introduce loss into the RF path and analog phase shifters in particular can exhibit significant shortcomings such as insertion loss variations and phase-shift range limitations. For more complex digital or hybrid modulation schemes, passive modulator components may also need elaborate calibration look-up tables to achieve desired phase and amplitude modulation accuracy with respect to process and temperature variations. Hittite has recently developed high-performance, active I/Q vector modulator MMICs for communication systems operating up to C-band, based on SiGe and GaAs HBT process technologies. As part of this program, we propose to apply similar circuit techniques together with more advanced device technologies to develop high-performance active vector modulators for both X- and Ka-band frequencies.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Final Orbit Product (daily files, generated weekly) from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/aeez-xv4i) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Final Orbit Product (daily files, generated weekly) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS final combined orbit products. The final products are considered the most consistent and highest quality IGS solutions; they consist of daily orbit files, generated on a weekly basis with a delay up to 13 (for the last day of the week) to 20 (for the first day of the week) days. All orbit solution files utilize the extended standard product-3 (SP3c) format and span 24 hours from 00:00 to 23:45 UTC.* [Space Radiation Risk Assessment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/skv9-cxne) - Project A: Integration and Review: A review of current knowledge from space radiation physics was accepted for publication in Reviews of Modern Physics (Durante and Cucinotta, 2011). Several Graphical Users Interface’s (GUI) of risk assessment models and computational tools were developed and published including: a) ARRBOD (Acute Radiation Risk and BRYTNRN Organ Dose);  b) NSCR (NASA Space Cancer Risk) c) GERMCode (Galactic Cosmic Radiation, GCR, Event-based Risk Model); d) RITracks (Relativistic Ion Track Structure). The GERMcode was developed to accurately describe fragmentation in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) beam-line and biological samples, and basic radiobiology experiments.     <p></p>
Project B: Cancer Risk Projection Model and Uncertainties: New findings and knowledge from NSRL and other sources were used to revise the NASA’s risk model for space radiation cancer risks:     <p></p>
1)	Revised values for low LET risk coefficients for tissue specific cancer incidence.     <p></p>
2)	An analysis of lung cancer and other smoking attributable cancer risks for never-smokers show significantly reduced lung cancer risks as well as overall cancer risks for astronauts as compared to the risk estimated for the average U.S. population.    <p></p>
3)	Derivation of track structure based radiation quality functions that depend on charge number, Z, and kinetic energy, E, in place of a dependence on LET alone. The assignment of a smaller maximum in the quality function for leukemia than for solid cancers.    <p></p>
4)	Revised uncertainty assessments for all model coefficients in the risk model (physics, low LET risk coefficients, dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF), and quality factors), and an alternative uncertainty assessment that considers deviation from linear responses due to non-targeted effects (NTE).    <p></p>
Results of calculations for the average U.S. population show more restrictive dose limits for astronauts above age 40 y as compared to National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Report 132, and a modest narrowing of uncertainties if NTEs are not included and much broader uncertainties with NTEs. Risks for never-smokers compared to the average U.S. population are estimated in a mixture model to be reduced by more than 20% and 30% for males and females, respectively. A larger reduction is possible if purely multiplicative risk transfer is assumed.     <p></p>
Project C: Biochemical Kinetics Models of Molecular Pathways: A system biology model (Cucinotta et al., 2008) of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway was developed and used to make quantitative descriptions of the gamma H2AX foci and double strand break (DSB) rejoining experiments. The model is extended to consider the radiation quality dependence of the relative fraction of simple and complex DSB, rejoining and associated repair defects, and the kinetics of various radiation induced foci (RIF). In further work, the addition of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and the MRN complex to the model was achieved and the role of processing damaged ends by the Artemis proteins is being modeled (Li and Cucinotta, 2011).  The interaction of several growth factors with NHEJ components was studied, including the interaction of the growth factors EGFR, IGF1, and TGFbeta-Smad with ATM and DNA-PK. New approaches to Green’s functions for stochastic treatment of molecular diffusion processes were developed (Plante et al. 2011). Flow cytometry or immune-staining considers signals in individual cells and thus provides several unique capabilities to support computation modeling using stochastic approaches. In contrast, methods that average the values of many cells such as Western blots, gene arrays, etc. are limited in elucidating events at low dose where fluctuations are expected to be important. To improve our understanding of DNA repair complexes numerical approaches to simulate immunohistochemistry (Ponomarev et al., 2008,* [Broadband Reflective Coating Process for Large FUVOIR Mirrors, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sfhn-g8xj) - ZeCoat Corporation will develop and demonstrate a set of revolutionary coating processes for making broadband reflective coatings suitable for very large mirrors (4+ meters). Decades of research and flight missions (Hubble, GALAX and FUSE) have utilized metal fluorides such as, MgF2 and LiF, applied to Al to achieve FUVOIR coating requirements. While metal fluoride-protected Al remains the best option for meeting broadband reflectance requirements (90-nm to 2500-nm), ZeCoat offers a means to build upon the best known and proven coating recipe (the GSFC 3-step process) by: 1) utilizing ZeCoat's unique precision motion-controlled deposition system to uniformly apply a 5-nm layer (a requirement of the GSFC recipe) of coating material to a large coating area, 2) protecting mirror assemblies from damaging high temperatures by heating only the mirror surface using radiant heat (the GSFC process requires a 220C metal-fluoride deposition temperature), 3) using an FUV reflectometer (120-nm to 180-nm) integrated into the coating chamber to optimize the coating process for FUV reflectance and 4) investigating the feasibility of using a layer of Sn to protect LiF from degradation due to atmospheric moisture and organic contamination during ground storage and  re-evaporate the Sn once the observatory is placed in-orbit.* [Miniaturized High Performance Optical Gyroscope, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gvmt-2x42) - We propose a new approach for to the design and fabrication of miniaturized Interferometric Fiber Optical Gyroscope (FOG) that enables the production of smaller IRU with enhanced performance. The size and performance limitations of the standard FOG are being reduced due to the utilization of highly integrated approach of all the gyro components. Specifically, the ASE light source and the receivers, splitters and TIA are all incorporated in a small, robust silicon/silica platform using hybrid integration. In addition, the sensor is using an innovative new coil design and high performance miniaturized IOC that results in tenfold reduction of the bias temperature sensitivity compared to the existing FOG products. The combination of these attributes supports a smaller, lower cost, high performance and robust IRU that can serve future NASA mission needs.* [High Interactivity Visualization Software for Large Computational Data Sets, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5y48-dmfd) - We propose to develop a collection of computer tools and libraries called SciViz that enable researchers to visualize large scale data sets on HPC resources remotely from their workstations at interactive rates.  The proposed technology will interoperate with common existing scientific visualization software and provide equivalent core functionality optimized for very large data sets. Existing scientific visualization tools have specific limitations for large scale scientific data sets.  Of these four limitations can be seen as paramount: (a) Memory Management, (b) Remote Visualization, (c) Interactivity, and (d) Specificity.  SciViz overcomes these four issues and uses stack oriented approach in order to produce tools that can be more easily and widely adopted with minimal interruption within existing visualization environments. SciViz  will be an open source implementation.* [Advanced Materials for Safe, High Performance Space-Rated Lithium-Ion Batteries, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qqhv-7dvd) - NASA space exploration vehicles are trending to higher pulse power, energy capacity levels and cycle life in order to meet exponentially increasing performance and lifespan requirements. As the demand for on-board power and total energy-storage capacity has continued to increase, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of battery technologies with higher energy- and power-density potential. Although substantial advancements have been made in this class of batteries over the past ten years by both domestic and foreign suppliers, substantial limitations still exist in: energy and power densities, operational temperature limits, safety, and lifecycle and lifetime performance.  To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc. proposes the use of advanced nanocomoposite electrodes and ionic liquid electrolytes to enable increased performance and safety in lithium-ion batteries as compared to state-of-the-art devices.  The high capacity, high rate capability and high cycle life performance potential of the proposed advanced nanocomposite electrodes in combination with the inherent non-volatility and non-flammability of ionic liquids holds substantial potential in meeting this objective.  This proposed project will result in improved specific energy and power, wider operation temperature ranges, inherently safer operation, and excellent storage / cycle life as compared to current Li-ion batteries.* [SPHERES Autonomy and Identification Testbed, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8w4m-gg9c) - Many future space missions involve formation flying spacecraft performing imaging, inspection, assembly, and servicing missions.  Having multiple spacecraft in close proximity undergoing comparatively rapid maneuvers dramatically changes the nature of safe modes.  No longer can a spacecraft just null its rates, point its arrays towards the Sun and phone home.  Now, the faulty spacecraft must also ensure that it will not collide with others.  Furthermore, it must plan its maneuvers such that if it does experience a fault, the likelihood of collision is minimized.  Fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) is more complex and requires a vigilant on-board software watchdog that reacts to both intra-vehicle as well as inter-vehicle faults and plans according to the consequences. Payload Systems Inc. (PSI), along with it partners at MIT and Intellization, propose an Autonomy and Identification Testbed (SPHERES-AIT) based on the SPHERES platform.  SPHERES is a multi-satellite docking laboratory to mature metrology, autonomy, and path-planning algorithms for AR&D in the risk-tolerant yet long duration micro-gravity inside the International Space Station (ISS). This work will mature a modular autonomy software architecture that supports  on-orbit self-assembly and spacecraft formation flight using a coordinated terrestrial and ISS laboratory that supports spiral development.* [Novel Wick Structures for Improved Heat Pipe Performance, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rsuh-hkmd) - Heat pipes are commonly used for transporting heat over relatively long distances with very low temperature drop.  One of the limitations of heat pipes is the capillary limit, which states that the sum of pressure drops of the working fluid cannot exceed the capillary head developed by the wick.  Since most of the working fluid pressure drop is incurred in flow through the wick, it is important to reduce the wick resistance as much as possible while still being able to transport the required thermal load. 
All heat pipes made today have the same wick throughout the heat pipe.  This facilitates manufacture, however it causes a great deal more resistance to liquid flow than is minimally required.  By breaking the wick up into several different regions in which the wick properties are different, a more optimal stepwise wick is proposed.  Preliminary calculations done by the PI indicate that the capillary limit of a heat pipe can be increased by a factor of 2x to 3.5x, depending on the number of discrete steps the wick is divided into.   The proposed program aims to demonstrate the improvement in capillary limit experimentally.* [Novel Fabrication of Nano Device for Single DNA/Protein Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gmtw-e8ur) - The health of the astronauts during space flight is critical to the success of NASA?s space program.  Astronauts are exposed to tremendous environmental challenges, such as cosmic radiation, microgravity and confined space.  Their immune systems are easily compromised.  To study these effects, biomarkers such as nucleic acids and protein are measured to determine how the body reacts and adjusts to the stresses.  Current detection methods rely on traditional molecular techniques that are time-consuming and require skillful operators.  Also, the equipment needed is bulky and require high-power consumption.  Therefore, many measurements are not conducted near real time but are completed after the samples are frozen and returned to earth.  This leads to uncertainty on the reliability of the data.  In order to overcome these problems, Lynntech proposes a novel method to fabrication a nano-electronic biochip that potentially can provide single DNA/protein detection in near real time.  The proposed biochip will be more sensitive, smaller, more reliable, lower cost, and easier to operate for NASA?s mission than the most commonly used optical methods.  The ultimate goal is to develop a small real-time nucleic acid and protein detection biochip capable of conducting measurements for long duration space missions.* [IRAS MINOR PLANET SURVEY ASTEROIDS V4.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k8sd-wzqv) - The data presented with this data set include: (a) 8210 individual sightings associated with 2004 asteroids, (b) averaged radiometric diameters and geometric albedos derived from individual observations for 1796 numbered asteroids and 88 unnumbered asteroids (as of 1983) whose orbital elements were determined using astrometry from two or more apparitions; (c) an entry for each of 120 asteroids for which there is an accepted sighting; (d) entries for each of 4677 numbered asteroids and 2632 unnumbered asteroids (as of 1985) for which associations were sought in the IRAS data; (e) A summary of the number of times each asteroid was predicted to be scanned, and possible reasons for any failure to be detected.* [Advanced Fire Detector for Space Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3xm8-5bc4) - Reliable and efficient fire detection is a precondition for safe spaceflight.  The threat of onboard fire is constant and requires early, fast and unfailing detection.  Current fire detectors are prone to fatigue and have insufficient sensitivity, selectivity and time-response.  Smoke detectors cannot detect early stages of combustion and become unreliable if exposed to dust particulates.  New sensor technology is required to face the challenging tasks associated with future space exploration involving missions to the Moon and Mars.  Carbon monoxide formation is a reliable indicator of evolving fire threats onboard spacecraft and this gaseous combustion product allows rapid early detection.  Vista Photonics proposes to evaluate and implement emerging infrared light sources for high-performance optical CO detection.  Optical sensors are particularly favorable due to unique features like fast response, high precision and strong species selectivity.  Design criteria such as small footprint, low weight, low power consumption as well as internal calibration and continuous sensor health monitoring will be implemented to provide a spaceflight optimized sensor.  The proposed optical absorption approach uses modulation techniques together with a compact path length enhancing cell with a small sample volume.* [Radiation Hard Space Wire Gigabit Ethernet Compatible Transponder, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ufwa-ir3v) - Current and future programs of near-Earth and deep space exploration performed by NASA and Department of Defense require the development of reconfigurable, high-speed intra-satellite interconnect systems based on switching fabric active backplane architecture with high-speed serial interfaces. Electrical and/or optical transponders operating with Space Wire, Fire Wire, or Gigabit Ethernet protocols are required to support the associated data interconnects. The systems must be easily upgradeable, power-efficient, fault-tolerant, EMI-protected, and capable to operate effectively for long periods of time in harsh environmental conditions including radiation effects. To address the described needs, Advanced Science and Novel Technology Company proposes to develop a basic concept of the novel, optical, radiation-tolerant transponder, which will be implemented as a hermetically-sealed pigtailed multi-chip module with an FPGA-friendly parallel interface and will feature an improved radiation tolerance, high data rate, low power consumption, and advanced functionality. The transponder will utilize the company's patent-pending current-mode logic library of radiation-hardened-by-architecture cells. 8B10B encoding will be used to achieve data disparity equal to 0 and perform a reliable clock recovery. The encoder and decoder will utilize the company's patented half-rate architecture that improves radiation tolerance. The proposed characteristics will be achieved by utilization of an advanced SiGe BiCMOS technology.* [Micromechanical Models for Composite NDE and Diagnostics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7s66-axmk) - Modern aircraft increasingly rely on composite components, due to their excellent material properties.  However, fastening/joining and design methodologies in current use are artifacts of metallic aircraft component use and are not yet optimized for use with composites.  Furthermore, limitations in our current ability to observe manufacturing quality and in-service damage evolution of composite structures may prevent designers from realizing their full potential. Current NDE practices are incapable of overcoming these limitations. Thus, a new framework and methodology is needed for high resolution imaging and tracking of manufacturing quality and damage evolution.

The goal of this program is to enable assessment of the matrix, fiber, and bonding conditions for composites using a combination of detailed physics based models, high resolution imaging, and controlled loading sources to isolate the composite characteristic of interest.  In Phase I we will focus on magnetic field sensing (i.e., eddy-current) methods that can be combined with structural analysis to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of these NDE methods.  JENTEK and MR&D are well-positioned to deliver this methodology in the form of commercial software and NDE equipment.  We will also work with a major aircraft OEM to maintain our focus on practical solutions to high priority needs.* [MOPITT CO gridded monthly means (Thermal Infrared Radiances) V007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s9qp-3y8i) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals.

(2000a). This subset characterizes mean monthly surface climate over the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., latitude 10 N to 25 S, longitude 30 to 85 W) during nearly all of the 20th Century. The data are gridded at 0.5-degree latitude/longitude resolution and include seven variables: precipitation, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure, cloud cover, and ground-frost frequency. All variables have mean monthly values for the period 1901-1995, several have data as recent as 1998, and further data will be added by the data originators. In constructing the monthly grids, the authors used an anomaly approach that attempts to maximize station data in space and time (New et al. 2000b). In this technique, grids of monthly historic anomalies are derived in relation to a standard normal period. Station measurement data for the years 1961-1990 were extracted from the monthly data holdings of the Climatic Research Unit and the Global Historic Climatology Network (GHCN) and used in constructing the normal period (New et al. 1999). The anomaly grids were then combined with high-resolution mean monthly climatology to arrive at fields of estimated historical monthly surface climate. Data are in ASCII GRID format for ArcInfo. Information on creating this LBA subset is available in ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/physical_climate/GIS_EastAngliaClimateMonthly/comp/eastanglia_readme.pdf.Data users are encouraged to see the companion file New et al. (2000) for a complete description of this technique and potential applications and limitations of the data set. For additional information, refer to the IPCC Data Distribution Centre.To access the complete year-by-year monthly data set or data more recent than posted here, users may make a request with the Climate Impacts LINK Project at the Climatic Research Unit (e-mail: d.viner@uea.ac.uk; web site: www.cru.uea.ac.uk/link). LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system. More information about LBA can be found at http://www.daac.ornl.gov/LBA/misc_amazon.html.* [Laser frequency stabilization and stray light issues for LISA and other future multi-spacecraft missions Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/psmf-ze9h) - "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a joint NASA/ESA project which will use laser interferometry between drag-free proof masses to measure gravitational waves from many galactic and cosmological sources. The same interferometer technology is also the key to future multi-spacecraft missions such as multi-aperture telescope missions. These missions could include several spacecraft all separated by potentially 10s of km, flying in a fixed formation with sub-wavelength variations in their distances. These multi-aperture or distributed aperture telescopes will revolutionize the angular resolution in the infrared, optical, and even X-ray band.  This proposal addresses two components which are both critical to these missions.

The first component introduces a new technique to stabilize the laser frequency to an optical reference cavity. Laser frequency noise will be the limiting factor for most of the distributed aperture telescope missions; in contrast, LISA can trade frequency noise against ranging precision. This new technique is based on heterodyne interferometry which is also used to measure changes in the distances between the spacecraft. Because of this similarity, this  technology can easily be integrated into the payload. It requires the same photo detectors and digital signal processing systems that are used for the interferometry. It utilizes to a large degree existing components, reducing R&amp;D time and cost for all interferometric space missions. We have already started initial proof of principle experiments and have reached already a performance remarkably close to the performance of the standard and long time-favored modulation/demodulation technique. Now we propose to study this technique in more detail, study the limiting noise sources experimentally and theoretically, and push it to the limitations of the reference cavity itself. The expected final fractional frequency noise should be better than 0.01ppt for measurement times of a 1000s.

(CRG) proposes to advance the state of the art in composite health management through refinement of an existing technology developed by CRG called Reflexive Composites.  Reflexive Composites are the current state of the art in health management integrating piezoelectric structural health monitoring, healable polymer matrix composites, and intelligent controls delivering highly aware structures capable of identifying location and magnitude of damage with 1/16" spatial resolution.  Reflexive Composites respond to damage with a healing cycle capable of restoring up to 90% of mechanical performance post failure.   
CRG proposes to advance the state of the art in health management through the development of a next generation control system capable of analyzing structural health monitoring (SHM) data and determining the appropriate healing cycle, identifying the type of failure in the composite, make predictions to the loss in mechanical performance, generating custom healing cycles based on failure type, healing, and making predictions of restored mechanical strength.  The results of this analysis will allow the vehicle user to make any necessary mission adjustment to ensure vehicle survivability with the damaged structures on the vehicle.* [Superconducting Resonator Spectrometer for Millimeter- and Submillimeter-Wave Astrophysics Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ubuz-hvig) - "We propose to develop a novel ultra-compact spectrograph-on-a-chip for the submillimeter and millimeter waveband. SuperSpec uses planar lithographed superconducting transmission-line filters to sort incident radiation by frequency to an array of direct detectors such as MKIDs. The system is naturally wideband and can be very low loss, enabling background-limited spectroscopy on the ground and in space, as is currently done with a diffraction grating spectrographs. But while moderate-resolution grating systems for the mm and submm bands have sizes measured in tens of centimeters, SuperSpec can have a size measured in millimeters. If successful, SuperSpec will pave the way for a new kind of astronomical instrument for the submm/mm: a 2-D array of hundreds to thousands of individual spectrometers, each simultaneously measuring a separate spectrum. With the possible exception of polarization, such an instrument extracts all available information from the light at a telescope focal plane.



SuperSpec thus offers the potential to revolutionize astrophysics in the far-IR through millimeter, an important spectral regime for which the the Astro2010 Decadal Survey made two specific recommendations for this decade: 1) Participate in the Japanese-led SPICA space telescope with a spectrometer instrument such as BLISS, and 2) Construct CCAT and its associated instrumentation. Depending on SPICA's schedule, SuperSpec technology could be injected and would enhance and extend the long-wavelength capability of BLISS or a similar instrument. Whether or not SPICA moves ahead quickly, our demonstration will position SuperSpec to be used in on CCAT and suborbital platforms this decade, paving the way for optimal science return with future NASA-led cryogenic far-IR space missions on the drawing board for the next decade: CALISTO/SAFIR and SPIRIT.



SuperSpec is based on propagation on a superconducting transmission line (TL). As radiation propagates along the line, it encounters a seri* [Microdischarge Array Flexible Light Source for High-Efficiency Irradiation of Spaced-Based Crops, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v6kj-7z6e) - It is desirable to develop a high-efficiency lighting source for large-area irradiation of space-based crops.  The key requirements for such a system include high efficiency,  light weight, easy and rapid deployment, compact storage, ruggedness, and low cost.  Furthermore, in order to maximize the rate of photosynthesis, it is desirable that the light source deliver an emission spectrum that matches the absorbance spectrum of chlorophyll as closely as possible while minimizing the effects of emission outside of the visible spectrum.  To address these demanding requirements and overcome the limitations of alternative technologies, we propose to develop a large-area, high-efficiency, flexible sheet light source using microdischarge arrays using the combined talents of Anvik Corporation and a team from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, led by Prof. J. Gary Eden.  The development of a new technology to enable the fabrication of large-area, high-density microdischarge arrays on flexible substrates, possibly powered by solar cells, will enable dramatic advances in the portability, ruggedness, efficiency, and light quality of light sources for space-based crop irradiation and a wide variety of commercial applications, including LCD backlighting, large-area UV-curing, decorative lighting, photodynamic therapy, and germicidal applications.* [Lightweight High Temperature Beta Gamma Alloy/Process Development for Disk and Blade Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a4v6-9kwq) - The primary material and manufacturing limitations of gamma TiAl alloys include processing difficulties, requiring costly non-conventional processing requirements, and large lamellar grains, which reduces damage tolerance.  We have developed a new class of TiAl-based alloys, called beta gamma, which would remove such barriers.   Unlike existing gamma alloys, beta gamma alloys are designed such that the ductile â phase is adequate at elevated temperatures (for processing) but negligible at the anticipated use temperatures (for performance).  The alloys also feature significant grain refinement and compositional homogeneity.  This program is aimed to utilize such beneficial beta-phase distribution and microstructure features observed in small (0.7kg) samples into forged disks from medium size (25kg) ingots.  The process-ability will be validated by employing a conventional forging process, and refined lamellar microstructures will be generated through usual alpha treatments.  The significance of this innovation is that beta gamma alloy disks can not only be produced by conventional forging, but also show improvements in RT strength and ductility and may retain other attributes (density, creep and oxidation) of conventional gamma alloys.* [Prognostics-Enabled Power Supply for ADAPT Testbed, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u2d7-unwv) - Ridgetop's role is to develop electronic prognostics for sensing power systems in support of NASA/Ames ADAPT testbed. The prognostic enabled power systems from Ridgetop are to be integrated into NASA's Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT) and later used in the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).   Prognostics will provide power supply "state of health", remaining useful life (RUL) and notify operators of impending failures so that load-shedding or orderly switch-overs can be supported.

Using the ADAPT at NASA/Ames Research Center, Ridgetop will design, implement and validate a prototype prognostic sensor that employs both analog circuits and digital logic in a microcontroller unit (MCU) or microproprocessor controller (MPC) to "prognostics-enable" a high efficiency switching power converter.
The ADAPT is a testbed, developed to explore health-management systems in manned spaceflight with three main goals: 1) to assess performance of diagnostic tools and algorithms against a standardized testbed and repeatable failure scenarios, 2) to develop prognostic models (performance degradation, remaining life estimation) for spacecraft subsystems, and 3) prototype Advanced Caution and Warning System (ACAWS) algorithms and user interfaces.  

By developing effective and practical prognostics for a power supply, Ridgetop's role will be to extend the capabilities of the ADAPT testbed.* [High Interactivity Visualization Software for Large Computational Data Sets, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ttzp-wtjx) - Existing scientific visualization tools have specific limitations for large scale scientific data sets.  Of these four limitations can be seen as paramount: (i) memory management, (ii) remote visualization, (iii) interactivity, and (iv) specificity.  In Phase I, we proposed and successfully developed a prototype of a collection of computer tools and libraries called SciViz that overcome these limitations and enable researchers to visualize large scale data sets (greater than 200 gigabytes) on HPC resources remotely from their workstations at interactive rates.  A key element of our technology is the stack oriented rather than a framework driven approach which allows it to interoperate with common existing scientific visualization software thereby eliminating the need for the user to switch and learn new software. The result is a versatile 3D visualization capability that will significantly decrease the time to knowledge discovery from large, complex data sets.

Typical visualization activity can be organized into a simple stack of steps that leads to the visualization result.  These steps can broadly be classified into data retrieval, data analysis, visual representation, and rendering.  Our approach will be to continue with the technique selected in Phase I of utilizing existing visualization tools at each point in the visualization stack and to develop specific tools that address the core limitations identified and seamlessly integrate them into the visualization stack.  Specifically, we intend to complete technical objectives in four areas that will complete the development of visualization tools for interactive visualization of very large data sets in each layer of the visualization stack.  These four areas are:  Feature Objectives, C++ Conversion and Optimization, Testing Objectives, and Domain Specifics and Integration.  The technology will be developed and tested at NASA and the San Diego Supercomputer Center.* [Advanced Oxidation Technology for Potable Water Disinfection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e6ad-2kmw) - The availability of high-quality potable water is essential in crewed space missions. Closed loop water recycling systems as well as potable water holding tanks and waterlines provide environments for biofilm formation that can facilitate the growth of human pathogens, as well as organisms that can cause deterioration of distribution lines. Prevention requires the maintenance of a chemically stable and biologically effective residual concentration of biocide in water and wetted surfaces of the system. Current disinfection technologies in potable water systems for space applications utilize either iodine or silver biocide. Limitations exist in terms of incompatibility with some disinfection chemistries and surfaces, long-term health risk, rapid biocide depletion, and need for consumable supply and waste disposal. Lynntech proposes to develop an advanced disinfection system for water disinfection and biofilm prevention based on an on-demand biocide generator which does not require consumable chemicals. Excess disinfectant is decomposed on-demand into water and oxygen, representing zero toxicity for crew consumption of potable water. During the Phase I project, the effectiveness of the proposed system for potable water production will be demonstrated. During the Phase II project, an automated system will be developed and delivered to NASA.* [Rotor health monitoring combining spin tests and data-driven anomaly detection methods](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rbn3-kay3) - Health monitoring is highly dependent on sensor systems that are capable of performing in various engine environmental conditions and able to transmit a signal upon a predetermined crack length, while acting in a neutral form upon the overall performance of the engine system. Efforts are under way at NASA Glenn Research Center through support of the Intelligent Vehicle Health Management Project (IVHM) to develop and implement such sensor technology for a wide variety of applications. These efforts are focused on developing high temperature, wireless, low cost, and durable products. In an effort to address technical issues concerning health monitoring, this article considers data collected from an experimental study using high frequency capacitive sensor technology to capture blade tip clearance and tip timing measurements in a rotating turbine engine-like-disk to detect the disk faults and assess its structural integrity. The experimental results composed at a range of rotational speeds from tests conducted at the NASA Glenn Research Center’s Rotordynamics Laboratory are evaluated and integrated into multiple data-driven anomaly detection techniques to identify faults and anomalies in the disk. In summary, this study presents a select evaluation of online health monitoring of a rotating disk using high caliber capacitive sensors and demonstrates the capability of the in-house spin system.* [Ceramic-Metal Interfaces by Functional Grading, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dwcs-bjbf) - Glacigen Materials proposes a novel technique for producing large-area sheets of functionally graded materials (FGM), which yield robust ceramic-metal interfaces capable of withstanding harsh environments that include high temperatures. Propulsion systems offer some of the harshest possible design conditions from a materials perspective and the demands placed on engineering materials will become more rigorous in future systems. The combination of structural and environmental constraints often dictate that ceramics and metals be used synergistically. Unfortunately, the limitations of ceramic-metal joining are exacerbated in these same environments where simultaneous use of ceramics and metals would be most useful. Large discrepancies in thermal expansion coefficients and near-planar interfaces lead to delamination and spallation even in the best engineered bonds.
     As a novel approach to this problem, Glacigen will create robust C-M interfaces by grading from one material phase to the other through a tailorable thickness. The technique is materials flexible, enjoys exceptional damage tolerance, and can accept significant mismatches in thermal expansion coefficients. The method for producing FGM sheets presented in this proposal will have the added advantage of controlled anisotropic properties within the sheets. In particular, it is anticipated that this new material system will be particularly valued for its damage tolerance at the interface where up to 96% of the interface can be destroyed before contact area is reduced to that of a planar joint with the same footprint. A second point of unique value will lie in the utility of engineered anisotropy where through thickness thermal conductivity is expected to be dramatically higher than in-plane thermal conductivity. Phase I efforts will demonstrate fabrication of these sheets and will include the characterization of mechanical, thermal, and functional properties.* [SMEX03 ALMNet and SCAN Soil Moisture Data: Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7rsh-qm5x) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.

This data set includes soil moisture data collected at crop, pasture, and forested sites located within the Alabama MesoNet (ALMNet) network.* [Complementary Flyover and Surface Exploration of Planetary Destinations Where 3D Detail Matters](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tk7i-kdcc) - Points of persistent light exist on the rim of Shackleton crater and at other polar locations on the Moon, and perhaps Mercury. These destinations could serve as bases of operations or power stations for exploitation of polar resources. While sunlight is not truly eternal at these sites, the periods of illumination are much longer than elsewhere on the Moon. Solar-powered robots can explore these locations, hibernating through the short periods of darkness or moving from one oasis of light to another. But, for polar destinations, even small rocks cast long shadows, and unexpected shadows can be mission-ending for small rovers. Precise knowledge of 3D structure on the meter-scale and smaller is needed to predict where shadows will fall.

Sub-surface caverns may be the best place on Mars to find life. They may be the best hope for human habitation on the Moon. They can serve as safe havens that shield robots, astronauts, and structures from radiation, micrometeorites, dust storms, and temperature extremes. They also provide windows into a planet’s past geology, climate, and even biology. Skylights, formed by partial cave ceiling collapse, provide access to sub-surface voids. They have been conclusively shown to exist on Mars and the Moon, and evidence supports their existence on other planetary bodies throughout the solar system. Because skylights are so new and so unknown, it is much too risky to send astronauts, or even complex and expensive robotic systems, to explore these holes and the caverns below without prior reconnaissance. Surface robots can approach a skylight and scan the walls, but skylight geometry prevents viewing the floor of the hole from a surface perspective.

This research proposes complementary flyover and surface exploration for reconnaissance of point destinations, like skylights and polar crater rims, where local 3D detail matters. This reconnaissance is different from previous approaches to planetary exploration: it must detail the geometry of high-relief point targets partially obscured by terrain, not simply characterize regions. Lander flyover captures detailed overview data, as well as perspectives that cannot be observed from a rover viewpoint. Rovers can capture close-up images of the terrain, and they can linger to capture multiple views from stationary locations, though always from low, grazing perspectives. Alternately, landers can acquire bird’s-eye views but with less detail and resolution since their one-pass, always-moving trajectories are constrained by fuel limitations. Lander and rover data are combined, using lander data to localize and plan rover paths, to autonomously construct quality 3D models of point destinations.

Both cameras and active sensors, such as LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging), are used for model construction in the proposed approach. Active sensing is needed to peer into shadowed regions, but active sensors do not have the resolution that can be achieved with cameras and are range-limited by available power. Camera and LIDAR data are fused into high-fidelity models, but the real value in having both data types comes when localizing rovers within maps built from lander data. Difference in perspective between rover and flyover (lander or orbiter) data has traditionally been a stumbling block for automation of rover localization. This research proposes to solve the problem by taking full advantage of 3D and visual data, both in maps and in rover data. Approaches using both 3D and visual features simultaneously will be explored, as well as approaches that use one data type for coarse localization and another for refinement.

To facilitate exploration even in communications-limited areas, and to increase the efficiency with which exploration operations are performed, a fully autonomous modeling approach is proposed. Rover paths and views are planned autonomously, using next-best-view concepts, to fill holes and investigate areas of interest within a lander model.* [ABoVE: Study Domain and Standard Reference Grids, Version 2](https://data.nasa.gov/d/unsd-wvxf) - The Arctic - Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) has developed two standardized spatial data products to expedite coordination of research activities and to facilitate data interoperability. The ABoVE Study Domain encompasses the Arctic and boreal regions of Alaska, USA, and the western provinces of Canada, North America. Core and Extended study regions have been designated within this Domain and are provided in both a vector representation (Shapefile) and a raster representation (GeoTIFF at 1,000-meter spatial resolution). A standard Reference Grid System has been developed to cover the entire Study Domain and also extends to the eastern portion of North America. This Reference Grid is provided as nested polygon grids at scales of 240, 30, and 5 meter spatial resolution. The 5 meter grid is new in Version 2. Note that the designated standard projection for the all ABoVE products is the Canadian Albers Equal Area projection.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Monthly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ef6z-v5xt) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

The Micro Return Capsule (MIRCA) is CAPE&rsquo;s first Planetary Entry Probe (PEP) flight prototype. Within this context, this project continues to develop the CAPE concept, and as part of the technology pathway,&nbsp;will carry out a balloon drop test flight experiment of MIRCA to verify deployment, flight software, communications, and aerodynamic parameters in a relevant environment.</p> <p>So far, no microprobe (less than 10 kg) has entered another planetary atmosphere and successfully relayed data back to Earth. Although the Deep Space 2 Mars microprobes did reach their destination (total mass about 6.5 kg each), unfortunately they were lost due to a combination of delivery system failures and other unknown factors. This project&nbsp;expands on the concept of a planetary entry probe based on the widely popular Cubesat-class spacecraft specification (Cubesat Application for Planetary Entry Missions, or CAPE probes). Within a science operational context, CAPE probes may be sent from Earth to study a celestial body&rsquo;s atmosphere, or to land/impact on some high-value target on its surface. Either one or multiple probes may be targeted to distributed locations throughout the geographic landscape and could be released systematically and methodically from an orbiting spacecraft. CAPE microprobes would each have its own propulsion, and hence would be capable of targeting regions identified by the mother ship as high-interest. This enables a completely new capability for science not possible with traditional &ldquo;drop-and-flyby&rdquo; schemes. To supplement its flexibility, each probe would incorporate a communications architecture that provides a high-level of assurance its precious data is acquired and transmitted back to Earth for analysis.&nbsp;CAPE consists of two main functional components: the &ldquo;service module&rdquo; (SM), and the &ldquo;planetary entry probe&rdquo; (PEP). The SM contains the subsystems necessary to support vehicle targeting (propulsion, ACS, computer, power) and the communications capability to relay data from the PEP probe to an orbiting &ldquo;mother-ship&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The PEP itself carries the scientific instrumentation capable of measuring atmospheric properties (such as density, temperature, composition), and embedded engineering sensors for Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) technology monitoring and assessment. The Micro Return Capsule (MIRCA) is the first engineering prototype of a PEP module.</p>* [TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) Level 1 Raw and Calibrated Radiance Products (TRMM Product 1A11) V6](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3h7e-ahcn) - The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation and to estimate its associated latent heating. TRMM was successfully launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.

The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a nine-channel passive microwave radiometer, which builds on the heritage of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument flown aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. Microwave radiation is emitted by the Earth&apos;s surface and by water droplets within clouds. However, when layers of large ice particles are present in upper cloud regions - a condition highly correlated with heavy rainfall - microwave radiation tends to scatter at frequencies above 19 GHz. The TMI detects radiation at five frequencies chosen to discriminate among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood of rainfall. The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by this method is the deduction of cloud precipitation consistent with the radiation measurement at each frequency. The TMI frequencies are 10.65, 19.35, 37 and 85.5 GHz (dual polarization), and 21 GHz (vertical polarization only).

The Level 1A product file (1A11) is a concatenation of the Level 0 data with a header record and, as such, is reversible to Level 0. The header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbit number, times of the first scan and number of scans, among other things. The Level 0 data contain the actual channel data expressed as &quot;sensor counts.&quot; A file contains data for a single orbit with a file size of about 7 MB (uncompressed).  There are 16 files of TMI 1A11 data produced per day.

Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.

TRMM V6 vs. V7 Major Data Format Changes: http://pps.gsfc.nasa.gov/Documents/formatChangesV7.pdf* [On-Chip hyperspetral imaging system for portable IR spectroscopy applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9n3r-pj8s) - Hyperspectral middlewave infrared and longwave infrared (MWIR/LWIR) imaging systems capable of obtaining hundreds of narrow band (10-15 nm) spectral information of Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and land use in agriculture are of great importance in NASA's Earth remote sensing missions. Existing hyperspectral MWIR/LWIR imaging systems are bulky and heavy and thus not suitable for portable and small satellite applications. This SBIR project aims to develop an on-chip hyerspectral imaging system with integrated narrow-band (15 nm) hyperspectral filers on the pixels of the MWIR/LWIR image array. Successfully developing the proposed innovation will provide an enabling ultra-compact on-chip hyperspectral imaging technology with significantly reduced size, weight, and power consumption suitable for NASA's portable and small satellite earth remote sensing missions. In phase I, the proposed on-chip hyperspctral imaging system will be evaluated and compared with existing technologies. A preliminary MWIR/LWIR photodetector with the integrated plasmonic narrow-band filter will be fabricated and characterized. In Phase II, a prototype of the miniature on-chip mega pixel (1024x1024) MWIR/LWIR hyperspectral imaging system will be developed for laboratory demonstration.* [Energy-Based Acoustic Measurement System for Rocket Noise, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k864-qy2b) - Accurate estimates of the vibroacoustic loading placed on space vehicles and payloads during launch require knowledge of the rocket noise source properties. Given the extreme nature of acoustic environments near the plume, data sufficient to characterize the noise source region have been difficult to acquire. Without these data, structures may be designed to handle insufficient or excessive vibroacoustic loads, resulting in either an overbuilt structure (and extra weight), or an under-designed vibration isolation system that could result in damaged cargos. Current energy-based acoustic probe designs have limited frequency bandwidth due to physical limitations. A new set of probe designs is proposed that incorporate both a new physical probe design but also a more advanced signal processing methodology that will significantly increase the usable frequency bandwidth of the probes while reducing the manufacturing and maintenance costs of the probes. The probe system will also include the design of a complete data acquisition system capable of recording data under the harsh conditions present in typical rocket motor test firings.* [CubeSat High Impulse Propulsion System (CHIPS), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ks9f-nts8) - CU Aerospace proposes the ground test validation of a nanosat primary propulsion subsystem using non-toxic propellant with 3-axis ACS for orbit change and/or de-orbit capability, precision maneuvering, and drag makeup. Our approach, called the CubeSat High Impulse Propulsion System (CHIPS), leverages the existing Micro Propulsion System (MiPS) thruster technology development by our team partner VACCO Industries and enhances it with the CU Aerospace very high efficiency warm gas variant of an innovative resistojet that significantly boosts the performance of standard cold-gas systems. The MiPS system has been tested to 200,000 cycles without any technical issues, demonstrating excellent reliability. The 1.5U CHIPS subsystem, using non-toxic proprietary EP-76 propellant, is a compact thruster system having a total impulse of 602 N-s and a fully throttleable thrust of 50 mN. The subsystem also includes an EP-76 3-axis cold-gas attitude control system.  Approximately 25 W of primary power is required from a battery included in the 1.5U package. The value of this technology is that this low cost subsystem demonstration will pioneer a family of nanosat propulsion systems, based upon an innovative warm gas system and propellant, which will become available to the CubeSat and nanosatellite community for a broad range of propulsion needs.* [LBA-ECO LC-23 Characterization of Vegetation Fire Dynamics for Brazil: 2001-2003](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jif6-3vbx) - Satellite fire detection was determined from two sensors, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA-12 and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on both the Terra and Aqua platforms, for 2001- 2003 to characterize fire activity in Brazil, giving special emphasis to the Amazon region. Active fire data for AVHRR/NOAA-12 was produced using a fixed threshold fire detection technique based on the algorithm developed by the Centro de Previsao do Tempo e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC/INPE) (Setzer and Pereira, 1991; Setzer et al., 1994; Setzer and Malingreau, 1996). Active fire data for MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua was produced using a contextual fire detection technique based on NASA-University of Maryland algorithm (Justice et al., 2003; Giglio et al.2003).Resulting fire counts were compared for major biomes of Brazil (Figure 1), the nine states of the Legal Amazon (e.g., Tocantins, Figure 2), and two important road corridors in the Amazon region (Figure 3). In evaluating the daily fire counts, there is a dependence on variations in satellite viewing geometry, overpass time, atmospheric conditions, and fire characteristics (Schroeder et al., 2005). The data provided are the coordinates of daily active vegetation fires in Brazil for 2001 through 2003 at 1km resolution for both AVHRR and MODIS sensors.  Data are provided in both Arcview (shape file format) and ASCII comma separated file formats. Vector files for the major biomes of Brazil, the nine states of the Legal Amazon, and two important road corridors in the Amazon region are also included.* [Thin Film Flat Panel Off-Axis Solar Concentrator with Flux Distribution, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gds8-wkfd) - Relatively small concentric thin film FRESNEL lenses and fresnel-like Multiple Parabolic Reflecting Surface (MPRS) reflectors have been successfully produced from molds machined with diamond turning lathes, which are limited in size to less than 15 feet diameter.  This size limitation prevents using this fabrication method for production of molds for operational size space concentrators and off-axis (non-concentric) patterns cannot be produced at all with lathes.  UAT has been demonstrated that computer numerical control (CNC) milling machines that can readily machine complex geometries, including any radius of curvature, can be used to produce mold segments representing any portion of any size MPRS.  These mold patterns can then be replicated on thin film sheets, which are then appropriately integrated to produce solar concentrators of the desired size. Multiple focal lengths/points, concentration ratios, and controlled flux distribution can be incorporated in a single reflector panel allowing substantial and previously unavailable Wireless Power Transfer System design flexibility.
	The Phase I program will verify the thin film performance capabilities and scalability of the MPRS concept and the Phase II program will provide a full scale concentrator applicable to Wireless Power Transfer technology for testing and deployment.* [High Test Peroxide High Sealing Conical Seal, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pekh-gem9) - High Test Peroxide (HTP) Highly Compatible High Sealing Conical Seals are necessary for ground test operations and space based applications.  Current conical seals are all made from relatively incompatible materials and the most compatible materials have limitations: stainless steel seals are hard to seat, especially at large sizes and are still only acceptable for short term exposure at best, whereas aluminum seals corrode quickly when exposed to HTP and other metals such as stainless steel.  The other common materials for conical seals, copper and nickel, are unsuited for HTP applications.  A highly compatible conical seal is non-existent, and the best seal available is stainless steel which is at best Class 2 and difficult to seal.  High compatible conical seals will permit long term storage HTP systems to be created and will improve operations which are currently using short term HTP systems.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Diurnal (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pwvn-iv8e) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present.

A freeform optical system is one that lacks rotational symmetry, meaning there is no constraint on the surface shape of the mirrors. Freeform designs can mitigate the disadvantages that prevent reflective systems from being used in larger field of view applications by yielding unobscured designs and leveraging the added freedom of surface shape to better correct the optical aberrations in the system. Freeform designs are made unobscured by breaking the axis of rotational-symmetry and tilting the individual elements themselves. They do not require an offset aperture or field bias, which brings a unique advantage in the correction of optical aberrations. By getting the mirrors out of their own way, more surfaces can be introduced. When compared to alternate solutions, whether it is a rotationally symmetric system or an unobscured system with the same number of elements, an increased diffraction-limited field of view has been demonstrated in our group's research.

Methods/Techniques: The exploration of the solution space will be accomplished by expanding upon the work of Andrew Rakich, who derived the analytical solution space for four-mirror anastigmat telescopes. The systems that are yielded from his method have spherical surfaces and an axis of rotational symmetry. These designs will be used as starting points for subsequent freeform designs. Lens design software will be used to optimize the design as the elements are tilted. When tilting elements, very strong astigmatism is introduced. Therefore, toroidal base mirrors for the freeform surfaces are needed for correction. Zernike polynomials are then introduced to the toroidal base shapes to further correct the system. The research aims to explore a variety of targeted research questions that aim to address space technology challenges. The sensitivity of the designs from the solution space to common tolerances will be studied using full-field displays that isolate each aberration and show its dependence over the field, combined with Nodal Aberration Theory that puts tolerances in linear space, making the sensitivity calculation efficient and complete. Special attention will be paid to geometries that may be more conducive to stray light reduction through the use of baffles. Similarly, other geometries may be more conducive to radiation shielding by using the mirror substrates themselves as part of the shielding. The added flexibility of folding geometry allows for the design to be tailored to system engineering constraints that could not be addressed with rotationally symmetric systems or unobscured non-freeform systems. Design approaches to achieve these characteristics will be developed.

Significance: This research will address NASA interests as per the July 2015 technology roadmap item TA 8.2.1.3. A key, driving aspect of this work will be to focus on revealing key flat field Large, low cost, lightweight precision monolithic mirrors that provide a high degree of thermal and dynamic stability, and wavefront sensing and control for Ultra-Stable Large-Aperture UV/Visible/Near-IR telescopes. This research is directly relevant to the Observatories level 2 TABS element, 8.2. More specifically, it is relevant to the level 3 TABS element Mirror Systems. The significance of this work is to provide imaging system designs with larger diffraction-limited etendues than the state-of-the-art, (meaning larger apertures and fields of view), which will make the most of limited package sizes and mass constraints. This will advance the optical instrumentation on space probes as well as observatories on the ground towards new space discoveries and knowledge.* [Design and Analysis of a Practical Heliogyro Blade Control System for Deployment and Flight](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hwkb-sig7) - A heliogyro spacecraft is a specific type of solar sail that generates thrust from the reflection of solar photons. The proposed research for this fellowship will address the limitations of current analytic models and control designs for a heliogyro spacecraft to develop practical solutions. The first objective is to derive new equations of motion for the essential blade dynamics. The reduced order model for a heliogyro spacecraft will include multiple degrees of freedom, coupled dynamics, solar radiation pressure loading and torque source boundary conditions, all of which are lacking from the current analytic models. The second objective is to develop a root control system that effectively damps the structural modes of a heliogyro spacecraft. The final objective is to determine the blade behavior during initial spin-up of the spacecraft and blade deployment. 

The main methods used to accomplish these research objectives will include classical control theory in conjunction with impedance control and a thorough understanding of the blade dynamics. The heliogyro spacecraft modeling will begin with simplified linear assumptions. The coupling and nonlinearities will be added incrementally to the model. 

The propellant-free heliogyro is a long-duration sustainable spacecraft whose maneuverability allows it to attain previously inaccessible orbits for traditional spacecraft. Continuing research in practical heliogyro control will significantly advance the TRL of this innovative design, in turn lowering the cost of existing missions and opening up exciting new mission possibilities.* [Magnetohydrodynamic-based Laboratories on a Chip for Analysis of Biomolecules, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tnit-uy3c) - A laboratory-on-a-chip design based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) microfluidics and integrated microelectrochemical detection is proposed.  The proposed device is well-suited for the rapid, automatic and highly sensitive detection of a wide variety of biomolecules of potential interest to NASA.  Interest in MHD microfluidic devices has previously been limited by their tendency to generate obstructive bubbles and to suffer quick erosion of the electrodes.  The proposed approach solves these problems and provides for very high flow rates and long electrode lifetimes.  In addition, the proposed device can be operated at very low voltage, and contain no moving parts, features that currently are not available with other forms of microfluidic devices.  In the present approach, the many significant advantages of MHD-based microfluidic systems are retained, including compatibility with a much wider variety of materials and solvents than electrokinetic based systems.  An integrated, self-contained microelectrochemical detection approach can be used in turbid, colored, or complex samples with a minimum or absence of false positives and false negatives.  Together, the two technologies offer a unique platform for biomolecular analysis.  For space applications where minimum sample handling steps and maximum automation are typically highly desired features, the proposed system should excel.* [Innovative Solid State Lighting Replacements for Industrial and Test Facility Locations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cwqe-e8cp) - The proposed innovation is the replacement of existing test stand and parking lot  fixtures with current SSL LED technology. The replacement fixtures will reduce energy consumption, generate less heat and provide maintenance free operation for over 50,000 hours. An explosion-proof fixture is capable of containing an internal combustion event without allowing flames or hot gasses to escape to the surrounding environment. The lighting fixture defined is an explosion-proof fixture for use in hazardous hydrogen/oxygen atmospheres. Current fixtures contain a 110 Watt reflectored incandescent lamp. SSL sources are remarkably efficient compared to incandescent sources. The 110 Watt lamp in existing explosion-proof fixtures will be replaced by an SSL fixture requiring only around 29 Watts for the equivalent lighting output.  The proposed Energy Focus solution will be an efficient, solid-state, explosion-proof  fixture for use in hydrogen/oxygen atmospheres which is compatible with current systems and provides the required lighting distribution. It will do this through advanced thermal and electrical power management to ensure long fixture life* [An On-Chip Nano-Plasmonics Based Urine Protein Assay Cartridge, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/44y7-pwbw) - Long-term exposure to microgravity and radiation during space exploration can pose a critical threat to the health of a flight crew. Real-time monitoring of urine protein levels is an effective way to follow the onset and progress of many diseases and guide the prompt selection of proper therapy. The success of such diagnostic tasks, which are vital for future space missions, critically depends upon the degree of automation, reusability and long-term lifetime of such trace level detection devices. To meet this need, this program will develop a novel on-chip, reagent-free, nano-plasmonic sensor cartridge to concurrently quantify the presence of different urine proteins. The envisioned device is compact, lightweight, fully integrated and automated, and highly cost- and power-effective. In Phase I, a new nano-plasmonics chip technology-based SPR sensor has been developed and successfully demonstrated for protein detection with excellent sensitivity. Critical microfluidic components, used in sample preparation, and adaptable to the sensor chip have been developed and validated by multi-physics-based simulations and modeling. In Phase II, the nano-plasmonic sensor will be optimized to increase sensitivity, stability, and the response to regular urine samples. The sensor chip will be integrated with the system-engineered microfluidics network to form a seamless urine protein assay cartridge (PAC) that enables automated surface modification, sample pretreatment, analyte detection and sensor regeneration for reuse. We will use modular design of the PAC that is compatible with existing NASA astrobiological instruments and will enable high-throughput proteome profiling analysis.* [Multilevel Control & Optimization of Future Air Traffic Systems via Managem](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9kin-9dcu) - <p>We investigate solutions to problems of air traffic control subject to real-world limitations on the computational/communication cost of finding that solution. The approach involves direct quantification of controllability of the system via establishing a set of comprehensive physical constraints on trajectory calculations. We develop practical and quantifiable measures of controllability and complexity to facilitate provability of system safety and inform the needs of functional allocation.</p><p>Controlling air traffic on all temporal and spatial scales – from a single aircraft to the entire airspace – can be formally stated as a dynamic, high-dimensional optimization problem with many objectives and constraints based on physics, economics, information, and other considerations. Especially in the future NAS, attempting to find the optimal solution to such problems as they arise during operations would often violate practical constraints such as computation time and/or communication resources. The issue is how to find the best solution subject to such constraints on the solution-finding algorithm. We propose to approach this as a multilevel optimization problem, where a complexity measure F maps the combination of s and an algorithm alpha (e.g., an algorithm that searches over a specified class of fine-grained traffic flows all having a given large-scale flow) to whether applying alpha to s would violate the practical constraints. Given F, the higher level optimization problem identifies the member of a set A of candidate algorithms that has best likely value of the objective functions, subject to provided practical constraints on the algorithm. A lower level optimizer then runs that algorithm and by construction is likely to do so within the given practical constraints. The technical approach will use mathematical programming, Probability Collectives (PC), and Machine Learning (ML), among other areas. The ultimate goal is a methodology and tools for use both in research and as a decision-making aid for all system participants, including aircraft pilots and automatic systems, air traffic controllers, and airlines.</p>* [Multi-Parameter Measurement in Unseeded Flows using Femtosecond Lasers (Tier 1)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3959-38sa) - <p>Measurements in NASA's wind tunnels generally consist of force and moment and on-body measurements like surface pressure, surface deflection or heat transfer to the surface.  Detailed off-body measurements are needed to understand complex wind tunnel flows and to provide data to validate high-fidelity computational models. Most existing techniques capable of measuring detailed off-body flows, for example, particle image velocimetry, require particle or gas seeding which is not possible in many of NASA's tunnels. In this project, two techniques utilizing new femtosecond laser technology will be investigated. Both techniques show promise of measuring multiple parameters quantitatively in unseeded wind tunnel flows. The femtosecond laser electronic excitation and tagging (FLEET) technique can measure velocity and potentially pressure and temperature simultaneously. The femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (FS-CARS) technique can measure pressure, temperature and species concentrations. The two techniques have relative advantages and limitations that will be explored.  The objective of this research project is to leverage recent advancements in laser technology and recent discoveries in academia to discover and apply new ways of measuring aerospace flows. In particular, methods of measuring the gas velocity, pressure, temperature and concentration will be developed. The two different measurement techniques share a common femtosecond laser technology and can be used separately or together to measure multiple gas properties simultaneously in wind tunnel flows and possibly in flight. In this project, we are extending the ability of FLEET to measure multiple parameters such as pressure and temperature simultaneous with velocity.  These additional parameters will be obtained by observing and interpreting the amplitude and spectrum of the FLEET signal.  The main novelty of the proposed work is that FLEET should allow velocity to be measured in several facilities where velocity cannot be curren</p>* [A Novel, Portable, Projection, Focusing Schlieren System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/prwb-pby4) - The schlieren technique has been used for flow diagnostics in wind tunnels since the beginning of aerospace research, due to its ability to make airflows -- especially shock waves and turbulence -- visible. This proposal describes a novel type of schlieren system that would increase efficiency, capability, and productivity for ground test facilities. The concept and the availability of state of the art components make the system more portable, easier to align, and more versatile than existing systems. A major drawback of current schlieren systems and one that has restricted their widespread commercial use is that they require exact alignment between a pair of widely separated mirrors or grids, which takes time and limits portability, and costs are prohibitive for most such applications. This problem is partially relaxed by focusing schlieren methods. The proposed concept incorporates features of existing schlieren systems while removing the primary limitations. All of the elements that require precise alignment are contained within a camera body and can be relatively inexpensive. Also, very large fields of view are made possible.  This is advantageous in wind tunnel facilities, since experiments are frequently installed only to be torn down shortly afterwards.* [Enabling Technologies for Fabrication of Large Area Flexible Antennas, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3zqp-in2i) - Flexible, foldable, and/or inflatable antenna systems open up a wealth of opportunities.  Integrating antenna elements and related electronics onto flexible substrates, however, poses significant challenges.  To our knowledge, there exists no technology that can incorporate a variety of electronic/sensor materials onto large-area flexible substrates to create flexible and conformable circuits in an economical and reliable way.  The majority of the limitations stem from processing techniques.  Mesoscribe Technologies, a high tech start-up from SUNY-Stony Brook, proposes to apply a breakthrough new direct writing technology to meet the objectives set-forth in the NASA SBIR topic S2.06 Advanced Flexible Electronics.  This technology is based on revolutionary advances to modern day thermal spray materials processing enables deposition of wide range of electronic materials onto large areas at low processing temperatures and, for most part, requires no post-processing.  The Phase I effort focused on demonstrating proof-of-concept to deposit conducting microstrip lines and sensors on flexible substrates.  The Phase II program will be focused exclusively on developing a Direct-Write-Thermal-Spray based large-area patterning capability that is based on roll-to-roll processing to fabricate large-area antennas on flexible substrates, focusing, in particular, on JPL's L-band membrane-based active phased array radar.* [Global Soil Texture and Derived Water-Holding Capacities (Webb et al.)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mvks-hu9x) - A standardized global data set of soil horizon thicknesses and textures (particle size distributions).* [A Model-based Avionic Prognostic Reasoner (MAPR)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mkuh-9bfp) - The Model-based Avionic Prognostic Reasoner (MAPR) presented in this paper is an
innovative solution for non-intrusively monitoring the state of health (SoH) and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of electronic and electromechanical assets by accessing and processing data obtained from a standard avionics data bus. To support Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring (IVHM) initiatives, the solution being described here has been designed to be as non-intrusive as possible. An innovative, model-driven anomaly diagnostic and fault characterization system for electromechanical actuator (EMA) systems was developed to mitigate potentially catastrophic faults. EMA systems are used in a wide variety of aircraft applications to control critical components such as control surfaces, landing gear and thrust vector control. Failure in any one of these systems can compromise passenger safety, as well as mission success. A MIL-STD-1553 bus interface and monitor were designed to extract environmental (e.g., altitude, air speed, air density) and operational (i.e., response of system to a commanded change) data of a representative EMA system and to determine whether an anomaly is detected, and the corresponding severity. The MIL-STD-1553 bus was chosen as the test bed to develop this approach, due to its large installed base and availability of compatible development tools. Advanced and unique reasoning methodologies are applied to the extracted data sets to provide anomaly detection and fault classification on various fault modes and eventually yield SoH and RUL. In this paper we describe a data monitoring unit that will, in real time, identify, isolate, and characterize faults and establish their severity so that major performance problems can be alleviated. When built, this system will consist of a laptop with a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) card slot that can accept multiple interfaces to the MAPR software package. The MAPR package will be designed to be adaptable for a large number of different platforms, for portability and for maximum input data type flexibility. This paper describes a ground-based prototype of the technology to show the efficacy of the method.* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 Total Column Ozone Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dg5j-hgxp) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 Total Column Ozone Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure.  Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites as well as precise station positions and velocities for the network of GNSS receivers. The IGS Reference Frame Coordinator uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS station position/velocity product. The final products are considered the most consistent and highest quality IGS solutions and consists of daily and weekly station position and velocity files in SINEX format, generated on a daily/weekly basis by combining solutions from individual IGS ACs, approximately 11-17 days after the end of the solution week. The final station position/velocities residual product consists of the residuals between the AC solutions and combined reference frame solution.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Final Orbit/Reference Frame Product Summary from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bfq9-224t) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Final Orbit/Reference Frame Product Summary from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

Such a system is a novel creation that can tolerate the severe aerothermal environment associated with hypervelocity flight.  The proposed system answers a critical need for enhanced situation awareness, performance characterization, and rapid anomaly resolution.  Images of control surfaces, vehicle health, separation deployment, plume dynamics, combustion behavior, and many other vehicle properties provide a rapid, global assessment of the flows and control status of aerospace vehicles and propulsion systems using a standardized diagnostic package.  The system design includes a window, window mounting system, camera, and independent telemetry system.  Work in Phase 1 will include computational aerothermal modeling, window, mount, camera, and telemetry design, preliminary hazards analysis, and feasibility/ applications assessment.  A Phase 2 prototype will be designed and fabricated for testing at a NASA facility, and finally used on a variety of vehicles in Phase 3.  It is expected that the imaging system will have broad application for NASA, DOD, and commercial aerospace vehicles.* [Functionalized Nano-Film Microchannel Plate: A Single High Aspect Ratio Device for High Resolution, Low Noise Astronomical Imaging, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i6kh-5eha) - The proposed innovation is to apply proven nano-film technology to enable Microchannel plate (MCP) devices to be manufactured on a range of insulating substrates and devices which possess sufficiently high gain and low ion feedback to replace chevron stacks in current NASA detector technologies.  Commercial MCP devices have many desirable properties, such as sensitivity to small amounts of light and excellent position and timing resolution.  MCP production is a mature technology, based largely on techniques and materials developed in the 1970's, and is limited to small area devices. Limitations due to the bulk glass manufacturing technology adversely impact many applications and impair manufacturability.  For example, heavy metal impurities contained within the bulk glass of the MCP limit the achievable dark noise in low signal detection.   In MCP manufacturing, the requisite batch processing restricts flexibility to tailor individual device or small batch performance to specific applications and can often result in poor MCP yield due to variations in composition and poor process control.   In this proposal, we will utilize atomic layer deposition (ALD) of nanometer thin films which has been proven to replicate and improve the component functions of secondary electron emission (SEE) and conductivity on non-traditional glass substrates, to investigate the high gain and low ion feedback capabilities of this technology.  We estimate that the technology stands at TRL 2 at the and expect to be at 4 at end of the Phase 1 contract.* [Asteroid Tomography](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hbca-i2rp) - <p>This proposed project will perform the study and simulation, of a concept for an instrument to tomographically map the internal density (structure) of an asteroid using Atom Interferometric Gravity Gradiometers (AIGG).&nbsp; The targeted outcomes are instrument design parameters, performance limitations, possible mission configurations, and a road map for further technology maturation.</p> <p>The objective of this project is to continue to mature the concept of the gravity gradiometer instrument through simulation, development of its design parameters, and establishing its limitation.&nbsp; The Project will work with other Projects with potential missions on which this technology would provide detection possibilities beyond current state of instrumentation.</p>* [CNT-Based Smart Electrostatic Filters for Capturing Nanoparticulate Lunar Regolith, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ewtn-bupp) - The abrasive, reactive, and ubiquitous nature of lunar regolith created significant and serious problems during the Apollo moon missions.  In this Phase I, Agave BioSystems, in collaboration with Dr. Randy Vander Wal of the Universities Space Research Association, propose to develop next generation smart filters using novel carbon nanotube (CNT)-based structures in electrostatic devices.  Since CNTs have extremely high surface area, can function without the mass transfer limitations of traditional filtrations systems, and they can be charged to emit very high charge densities, they constitute an ideal material for integration into spacecraft air handling systems as electrostatic filtration components.  The overall goal of this program is to build upon the unique structural and electronic nature of carbon nanotubes to create novel smart filters.  By synthesizing the CNTs in situ on solid mesh supports and integrating them into a novel electrostatic particle collection unit, we aim to create novel filtration media capable of removing airborne lunar regolith from spacecraft airlock and cabin atmospheres.* [General Purpose Data-Driven System Monitoring for Space Operations](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gfra-htnj) - Modern space propulsion and exploration system designs are becoming increasingly
sophisticated and complex. Determining the health state of these systems using traditional methods is becoming more difficult as the number of sensors and component interactions grows. Data-driven monitoring techniques have been developed to address these issues by
analyzing system operations data to automatically characterize normal system behavior. The Inductive Monitoring System is a data-driven system health monitoring software tool that has been successfully applied to several aerospace applications. Inductive Monitoring System uses a data mining technique called clustering to analyze archived system data and characterize
normal interactions between parameters. This characterization, or model, of nominal operation is stored in a knowledge base that can be used for real-time system monitoring or
for analysis of archived events. Ongoing and developing Inductive Monitoring System space operations applications include International Space Station flight control, spacecraft vehicle
system health management, launch vehicle ground operations, and fleet supportability. As a common thread of discussion this paper will employ the evolution of the Inductive Monitoring
System data-driven technique as related to several Integrated Systems Health Management elements. Thematically, the projects listed will be used as case studies. The maturation of Inductive Monitoring System via projects where it has been deployed or is currently being
integrated to aid in fault detection will be described. The paper will also explain how Inductive Monitoring System can be used to complement a suite of other Integrated System Health Management tools, providing initial fault detection support for diagnosis and recovery.* [Large-Area, Self-Sufficient, Low-Cost MEMS Skin with Integrated Wirleless Communication Capability, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dhnk-nru5) - An integrated unit that harnesses its energy from its surroundings and reacts to, and transmits, any changes in its environment in a predictable and reliable manner would be of significant benefit to the sensor community.  Advances in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), silicon, SiGe, and GaAs fabrication technologies have helped to constantly add new sensing and communication functionality in a given device footprint.  A significant limitation with the current state-of-the-art processes though, is the constraint to fabricate devices and circuits on a relatively high-cost, defect-free, single-crystal, base substrate.  This has also limited the potential of an integrated mixed-material design solution that is a key to high-performance communication systems.  Finally, a lack of large-area processing tools has precluded the development of a stand-alone, large-area sensor skin.  Building on Anvik?s proven, large-area, excimer laser based recrystallization and annealing technologies, and ongoing efforts in developing MEMS process technologies on flexible substrates, we propose to develop a fabrication technology to enable wireless communication circuitry on low-cost, flexible base substrates for large-area ?skins?.  There are several applications for this technology in free-moving sensor systems, space-based MEMS and distributed sensor networks for health-monitoring of space based systems, and commercial applications such as cell-phones and PDAs.* [LBA-ECO LC-09 Soil Composition and Structure in the Brazilian Amazon: 1992-1995](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9nis-amxb) - This data set reports basic soil structure and composition information for five Amazonian research sites: Altamira, Bragantina, Tome-Acu, and Ponta de Pedras, all four in the state of Para, Brazil; and one site in Yapu, Colombia. Soil characteristics reported for all five study sites include cation information (e.g., H, Al, Mg, K, Na, S), percent of soil C, N, and organic matter, soil texture/composition and color, pH, and land use history. Soil bulk density and tons of carbon/ha are reported for only three of the study sites: Altamira, Bragantina, and Tome-Acu. All of the data are provided in one comma-separated data file.The five study areas represent characteristic differences in soil fertility and a range of land uses typical of the Amazon region. One of these areas, Altamira, is characterized by above average pH, nutrients, and texture. The other four areas are more typical of the 75 percent of the Amazon that is characterized by Oxisols and Ultisols, with well-drained but low pH and low levels of nutrients. Ponta de Pedras in Marajo Island, located in the estuary, is composed of upland Oxisols and floodplain alluvial soils. Igarape-Acu in the Bragantina region is characterized by both nutrient-poor Spodosols and Oxisols. Tome-Acu, south of Igarape-Acu, represents a mosaic of Oxisols and Ultisols. Yapu, in the Colombian Vaupes, is composed of patches of Spodosols and Oxisols. Three of the areas are colonization regions at various degrees of development: Altamira is a colonization front that opened up in 1971, whereas Tome-Acu was settled by a Japanese population in the 1930s, and Bragantina was settled in the early part of the twentieth century. Marajo (Ponta de Pedras) is the home of caboclos, whereas Yapu is home to Tukanoan Native American populations. In these study areas  slash-and-burn cultivation as well as plantation agriculture and mechanized agriculture are employed. Length of fallows vary in these communities. The two indigenous areas leave their land in longer fallow than do the three colonization areas, and the proportion of land prepared from secondary forests increases with length of settlement as the stock of mature forest declines over time.* [CH3D ICE ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ieqz-cmuv) - This data set is the result of laboratory transmission spectroscopy experiments performed within a sealed cell in the ice laboratory at Northern Arizona University. We record spectra at wavelengths from 1 to 6 microns to study CH3D bands at 2.47, 2.87, and 4.56 microns (as indicated by '25', '29' and '45' in the data file names). We report temperature-dependent absorption coefficients of these bands when the CH3D is diluted in CH4 ice and also when it is dissolved in N2 ice. These absorption coefficient spectra can be combined with data from the literature to simulate arbitrary D/H ratio absorption coefficients for CH4 ice and for CH4 in N2 ice. The data were originally published in 2011 in Icarus, vol. 212, pp. 941-949, and that paper should be consulted for details about laboratory procedures and limitations of the data.* [Three Dimensional Volumetric Terahertz Scanning for Aerospace Non Destructive Evaluation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c9u8-tt6k) - In this Phase I STTR project, we propose to develop the critical innovations necessary for a high speed three dimesnional terahertz (THz) tomographic imaging system for aerospace non destructive evaluation (NDE) applcations.  NASA and the Aerospace industry are beginning to utilize THz reflection imaging (for example, examining the space shuttle external tank sprayed on foam insulation for voids and disbonds).  THz NDE imaging is widely applicable to composite resin, ceramic, plastic, natural, and other non-metallic materials.  Current commercial equipment is capable of  two dimensional raster scanning.  The wider utility of THz NDE technology can be more fully exploited for the development of NASA and aerospace applications if the full potential for high speed three dimensional THz imaging is realized.  The current state of the art equipment collects the THz waveform reflection from a very narrow depth range from a strongly reflective backing.  The proposed innovations will increase the dynamic range of the THz waveform acquisition to allow collection of reflections from weaker interfaces, and will increase the window of high speed scanning of the THz waveform to allow three dimensional images to be reconstructed for objects many inches thick.* [Tissue-Equivalent Radiation Dosimeter-On-A-Chip, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vu7n-hh22) - Many commercially available digital dosimeters are bulky and are unable to properly measure dose for space radiation.  The complexity of space flight design requires reliable, fault-tolerant equipment with the capability of providing real-time dose readings during a mission, which is not feasible with the existing thermo-luminescent dosimeter (TLD) technology.  
The project will create a compact, lightweight, energy-efficient dose meter comprised of a tissue-equivalent scintillation crystal coupled to a solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM), which is an array of CMOS photodiodes, operated in Geiger avalanche mode.  The ubiquitous nature of CMOS technology provides a standardized development platform, and the ability to integrate all the supporting electronics into a miniature, simple design.  
	In Phase I, we will model the expected dosimeter performance and characterize the performance of a prototype dosimeter exposed to high-energy protons, which simulates radiation in the space environment.  We will also determine the TLD-dose equivalence of our measurements.  In Phase II, we will create the support software and design and fabricate a finalized chip that includes readout electronics, power supply, memory storage, and other interfacing components.* [Chronic Telemetric Biofluid Flow Monitoring Device, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cgn9-betp) - Chronic Telemetric Biofluid Flow Monitoring Device, Phase I* [Rapid In-Place Composite Rotor Damage Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/m2ry-upak) - Luna Innovations is proposing to further develop the Rapid In-Place Composite Rotor Damage Detection (RIPCoRDD) System for determining and tracking the structural health of composite rotorcraft blades and other composite structures. There is a need for accurate, reliable assessments of the condition of composite parts which may have been damaged through impacts, fatigue, or abrasion.  This is especially true for cases in which the  damage may not be visible from the surface. The RIPCoRDD system is designed such that it will enable composite rotor damage detection in seconds with absolutely no increase in weight, power consumption, or volume of the rotorcraft. The core of the RIPCoRDD device is a unique, distributed, high-definition fiber optic strain sensor (HD-FOS) which provides spatially dense strain measurements (every 1.25-2.5 mm) within the composite structure, coupled with a ground based installation of Luna's proven optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) instrumentation.  Commercialization will focus on transitioning the technology first to OEM manufacturers for non-destructive inspection applications, followed by deployment to rotorcraft end users for lifetime monitoring and diagnostics.* [Coded Aperture Techniques for High-Throughput Imaging Spectroscopy, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vet2-zjf8) - We propose the use of programmable, two-dimensional (2D) coded apertures for high-throughput imaging spectroscopy. Spatially-varying, 2D, transmissive or reflective encoded mask, such as a hadamard or bernoulli random matrix, can be leveraged to realize high-throughput variants of many standard imaging spectroscopy techniques with throughput enhancements surpassing 50-100x compared to slit-based systems. In addition, recent advances in fast-switching spatial light modulators enable the reprogramming of mask encoding on the millisecond timescale. The combination these two technologies enables a wide array of potential innovations for hyperspectral imaging systems offering high-throughput, compressive measurement, with significant operational-flexibility. In this proposal, we target the application of these techniques to the development of a high-throughput, pushbroom imaging spectrometer for planetary science applications.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/p7jp-ncu7) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [FLASHRAD: A 3D Rad Hard Memory Module For High Performance Space Computers, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vfb2-e934) - The computing capabilities of onboard spacecraft are a major limiting factor for accomplishing many classes of future missions. Although technology development efforts are underway that will provide improvements to spacecraft central processing units (CPUs) they do not address the limitations of current onboard memory systems. In addition to CPU upgrades, effective execution of data-intensive operations such as terrain relative navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning and scheduling, and onboard science data processing and analysis require high-bandwidth, low-latency memory systems to maximize processor usage (i.e. to overcome the "memory wall").  Copious amounts of data being generated on a mission require large amounts of non-volatile memory storage in order to store this data for transmission back to earth when power to do this operation is available.  Furthermore, the memory system must be capable of providing the necessary operational robustness and fault tolerance required for space applications.  In an effort to support the needs for NASA's High Performance Space Computer (HPSC), it is proposed that this research investigates the challenges and opportunities in developing a space-qualified, 3D Flash memory cube utilizing COTS memory devices supplemented with a custom Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) controller.  Focus would be on developing a NAND Flash memory module that could be used for SSRs to help increase the memory densities, lower power, lower cost and to achieve higher data throughput.* [High Watts per Kilogram - Advanced Integration and Heat Management solar array technology (HaWK-AIHM ), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ere4-hiiu) - Small satellite architectures have become a desirable low cost alternative to larger heritage spacecraft for advanced scientific missions.  Unfortunately, the traditional component make-up of a small satellite or cubesats is for short duration missions and not specifically designed for space environment resiliency. NASA has identified several scientific missions which would benefit from highly engineered, space environment tolerant and high reliability components. MMA Design (MMA) proposes new innovations in small satellite deployable solar arrays for theses missions, specifically targeting high reliability, simple and heritage proven designs, and high performance. • Composite deployable hinge mechanism - due to volumetric constraints and stowed thickness requirements, an innovative composite panel-to-panel hinge mechanism is required. MMA has extensive knowledge in the design, manufacturing and test of composite tape hinges for deployable structures. The challenges that will be addressed in this effort is how to design a composite hinge with a tight stowed radius of curvature and a method of integration to the substrate panels that provides higher thermal conductivity than a traditional clevis hinge. • Advance high stiffness, high-k solar array substrates, multi-functional - limitations with traditional polyimide or glass-fiber substrates is that they exhibit low stiffness and thermal conductivity properties. Alternatively, High-K Mesophase-pitch based graphite fibers would provide magnitudes higher thermal conductivity, thus providing better heat transfer throughout the solar array panel. Also proposed are innovations in co-cured substrate construction whereby a highly emissive film is cured directly into the substrate panel creating a surface for significant heat rejection a on the backside of the solar array. The front side of the panel will also include a cured in circuit trace, which will significantly reduce wiring routing on the solar panel.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Population](https://data.nasa.gov/d/b3rc-4ua4) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Population data sets provide baseline population information as one of the drivers of ecosystem change. The data helped in estimating the magnitude of regional pressures on ecosystems. The MA Population data sets include Gridded Population of the World (GPW) version 3, population grids from the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) (alpha version), Global Subnational Infant Mortality Rates (alpha version), and Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition (alpha version) data. (Suggested Usage: To preserve access to the original global and regional population data used by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and other related research.)* [SMEX03 ENVISAT ASAR Data, Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5jgs-spka) - This data set is comprised of browse images acquired over the regional study areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma USA as part of the 2003 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX03).* [Pre-collimator Chemical Milling for X-ray Telescopes, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4ezd-iwhj) - Combining Chemical Milling with wire Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM), Mindrum Precision will build a precollimator (PC) faster and more cost effective than current methods.

  Space-based x-ray telescopes currently involve the use of a PC to shield the optics from stray light. Each PC requires extensive build time from highly skilled technicians. The PC cylindrical aluminum ribs (or blades) are individually attached to alignment frames. This hands-on "place/weld/measure and repeat" process is ineffective for the thousands of ribs. Build times have exceeded a year, and sometimes the PC still failed to perform. Some telescopes scrap the PC early to avoid these complications and accept the limitations in performance.

  Eliminating the hands-on time with CNC unattended wire EDM automates the build, but can't reach the thin walls required. Chemical milling of this large, complex structure is an innovation which will bring fast and affordable PC to market. 

  Current chemical milling uses HF and HNO3 acids to etch thin films of Titanium. However, etching is traditionally done on thin sheets. Mindrum Precision process will investigate etching of this complex material. New concentration levels, etch times, and agitation methods will be explored to achieve a uniform etch along the entire length of the numerous 3" slots.  

  Mindrum Precision will combine wire EDM with Chemical Milling to rapidly make affordable precollimators for future telescopes.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3x3c-y2vz) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios provide useful insight into the complex factors that drive ecosystem change, estimating the magnitude 

of regional pressures on ecosystems and critical uncertainties that could undermine sustainable development. They also provide an understanding of the importance of institutions and values 

as the long-range outlook for the world's ecosystems depends on the course taken by global and regional development in the coming decades. The integration of changing ecosystem conditions 

into the global scenarios was taken as both effects and causes. The MA scenarios include those for population, income, cereal production and consumption, meat production and consumption, 

land cover, waster stress, water availability, acidification and nitrogen deposition. (Suggested Usage: To preserve access to the original set of socioeconomic and natural resource scenarios used by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and other related research.)* [Low-Loss Ferrite Components for NASA Missions, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7ie9-2qdq) - The goal of this research is to develop high-frequency Faraday rotation isolators that exhibit significantly reduced loss, higher power handling and improved bandwidth over commercially available products. The bandwidth limitations of high-frequency circulators will be explored. It was demonstrated in the Phase I work that the bandwidth of these components can be substantially increased through impedance matching techniques. At the end of the Phase II program, Micro Harmonics will have developed a full line of isolators operating in bands from WR-12 through WR-3 and circulators working in bands from WR-15 through WR-5. In the phase I work our models were proven to be accurate. The approach is fundamentally sound, but there are significant technical challenges. These components will find immediate use in a broad range of systems used by NASA as well as the commercial sector.* [LBA Regional Monthly Climatology for the 20th Century (New et al.)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6mcj-hb8i) - ABSTRACT: This data set is a subset of "Global Monthly Climatology for the 20th Century (New et al.)" (2000a). This subset characterizes mean monthly surface climate over the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., latitude 10 N to 25 S, longitude 30 to 85 W) during nearly all of the 20th Century. The data are gridded at 0.5-degree latitude/longitude resolution and include seven variables: precipitation, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure, cloud cover, and ground-frost frequency. All variables have mean monthly values for the period 1901-1995, several have data as recent as 1998, and further data will be added by the data originators. In constructing the monthly grids, the authors used an anomaly approach that attempts to maximize station data in space and time (New et al. 2000b). In this technique, grids of monthly historic anomalies are derived in relation to a standard normal period. Station measurement data for the years 1961-1990 were extracted from the monthly data holdings of the Climatic Research Unit and the Global Historic Climatology Network (GHCN) and used in constructing the normal period (New et al. 1999). The anomaly grids were then combined with high-resolution mean monthly climatology to arrive at fields of estimated historical monthly surface climate. Data are in ASCII GRID format for ArcInfo. Information on creating this LBA subset is available in ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/physical_climate/GIS_EastAngliaClimateMonthly/comp/eastanglia_readme.pdf.Data users are encouraged to see the companion file New et al. (2000) for a complete description of this technique and potential applications and limitations of the data set. For additional information, refer to the IPCC Data Distribution Centre.To access the complete year-by-year monthly data set or data more recent than posted here, users may make a request with the Climate Impacts LINK Project at the Climatic Research Unit (e-mail: d.viner@uea.ac.uk; web site: www.cru.uea.ac.uk/link). LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system.

Both oxidation inhibited C/SiC and SiC/SiC composite material systems are proposed for this effort on the basis that: (1) C/SiC offers the highest use temperature and lowest cost of all currently available refractory composite systems, and (2) SiC/SiC offers the highest durability and longest life. Each material system offers unique performance/cost benefits and limitations, and each has been identified as a viable candidate for advanced propulsion and thermal protection system component applications. Oxidation resistant C/SiC and SiC/SiC composite plates will be fabricated incorporating a recently developed, 2nd generation oxidation inhibited matrix produced by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). Test samples from each material system will be prepared and experimentally evaluated in high-temperature tensile stress oxidation environments. The tensile stress rupture results will be compared to "baseline" uninhibited C/SiC and SiC/SiC composites to establish the performance benefits of the proposed approach.* [Production of Mature Highland Lunar Regolith Simulant, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jwgk-twqc) - As NASA considers manned and/or unmanned return missions to the Moon and beyond, it is imperative that high fidelity lunar soil simulants be developed in order to accurately evaluate the life span and efficiency of any equipment exposed to the lunar surface. One of the significant limitations of current simulants is the lack of certain constituents, such as agglutinates. These constituents, which can account for up to 60% by volume of a mature regolith soil, are widely regarded as components that must be present in any high fidelity simulant. Recently, Plasma Processes, Inc. has developed a process to produce Mare agglutinate simulant particles from JSC-1A feedstock. Characterization has confirmed that these agglutinate simulants have features (e.g. morphology, chemistry, crystalline phase content, nano-phase Fe) similar to actual lunar agglutinates.  When mixed with the JSC-1A root simulant in the correct proportions, the combination results in a high fidelity derivative Mare simulant. However, considering approximately 87% of the lunar surface consists of Highland regolith composition, mature Highland simulants are also of great interest. Hence, the primary technical objective of the proposed Phase I effort is to extend the technology employed to enhance the fidelity of Mare simulants to the production of high fidelity derivative Highland simulants.* [CALIPSO Lidar Level 2 Polar Stratospheric Clouds Data Product Ensemble, Provisional V1-10](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u8r8-7ptt) - CAL_LID_L2_PSCMask-Prov-V1-00 data are Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Lidar Level 2 Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC) profiles of PSC presence, composition, optical properties, and meteorological information along CALIPSO orbit tracks. The PSC data product ensemble describes the spatial distribution and optical properties of PSC layers observed by the CALIPSO lidar. Each file contains data from all nighttime orbit segments from a single day reported on a 5-km horizontal by 180-m vertical grid. PSC detection is limited to nighttime CALIOP observations because higher levels of background light during daytime significantly reduce the signal-to-noise and, hence, the PSC detection sensitivity. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) was launched on April 28, 2006 to study the impact of clouds and aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget and climate. It flies in the international A-Train constellation for coincident Earth observations. The CALIPSO satellite comprises three instruments, the Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), the Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR), and the Wide Field Camera (WFC). CALIPSO is a joint satellite mission between NASA and the French Agency, CNES.* [6 CFM Electrochemical Hydrogen Pump and Compressor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qqcy-j8v5) - Hydrogen is an essential resource for space missions. NASA has a need
for equipment to generate, handle and store hydrogen. In terms of
handling hydrogen, conventional rotating mechanical pumps and
compressors require extensive modification and have limited reliability.
Electrochemical pumping and compression of hydrogen occurs without any
moving parts and is highly reliable and efficient. Sustainable
Innovations has demonstrated up to 6,000 psi of compression using
electrochemical cell hardware. However, for high flow applications, such
as a 6 CFM hydrogen pump for NASA, a departure from traditional
electrochemical cell hardware designs is needed. The proposed Expandable
Modular Architecture cell design, allows a large variable footprint for
the electrochemical stack. This is achieved using modular cell parts to
create large active area cells. The modular parts are inexpensive to
manufacture and can achieve the high tolerances need for large active
area cells.  The proposed Phase I activity will demonstrate a single
cell Electrochemical Hydrogen Pump &amp; Compressor (EHPC) using the EMA
design to validate the modularity of the cell components. The ability to
stack large active area cells will also be demonstrated with a four cell
EHPC. For both pieces of cell hardware, cycling a pneumatic device will
be demonstrated. A manufacturing study will also be undertaken to
validate the compatibility of the EMA design with cost reduction
pathways. This will facilitate establishing the design criteria for a
3-4 CFM  1,000 psi EHPC to be constructed on Phase II* [Devices and Methods for Collection and Concentration of Air and Surface Samples for Improved Detection of Microbes onboard ISS, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/feqn-euex) - Protecting the International Space Station (ISS) crew from microbial contaminants is of great importance.  Bacterial and fungal contamination of air, surfaces and water aboard ISS has the potential to cause sickness among ISS crew and to impact onboard experiments.  Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments.  These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, creates a significant need for a rapid way to determine when microbial contamination events occur.  To this end, InnovaPrep LLC of Drexel, MO proposes development of improved methods for collection of microbes from air and surfaces for delivery into a small liquid volume compatible with advanced molecular based detection systems.
 Rapid microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour.  Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample collection and concentration techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in the environment.  In the proposed Phase I work, InnovaPrep will leverage current aerosol and surface collection and elution technologies and innovations from a 2015 NASA awarded SBIR for microbial concentration from ISS potable water, for handling of these technologies in a microgravity environment, to develop novel ISS aerosol and surface collection systems.  Specifically, InnovaPrep will develop new, optimized aerosol filter assemblies and surface sampling assemblies that allow for collection from larger air volumes and surface areas and elution into smaller liquid volumes than is currently possible.* [SAFARI 2000 Daily Rainfall Estimates, 0.1-Deg, Southern Africa, 1993-2001](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mhr3-7s6d) - The Microwave InfraRed Algorithm (MIRA) is used to produce an imagery data set of daily mean rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution over southern Africa for the period 1993-2001. MIRA combines passive microwave (PMW) from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) on board the DMSP F10 and F14 satellites at a resolution of 0.5 degrees and infrared (IR) data from the Meteosat 4, 5, 6, and 7 satellites in 2-hour slots at a resolution of 5 km. This approach accounts for the limitations of both data types in estimating precipitation. Rainfall estimates are produced at the high spatial and temporal frequency of the IR data using rainfall information from the PMW data. An IR/rain rate relationship, variable in space and time, is derived from coincident observations of IR and PMW rain rate (accumulated over a calibration domain) using the probability matching method. The IR/rain rate relationship is then applied to IR imagery at full temporal resolution. The results presented here are the daily means of those derived rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution.The rainfall data sets are flat binary images with no headers. They are compressed band sequential (bsq) files that contain all of the daily images for the given year. Each image is an array of 401 lines, each with 341 binary floating-point numbers, containing rainfall at 0.1 degree resolution for the area 10 to 50 degrees longitude and 0 to -34 degrees latitude. The number of band sequential images in each annual file and the associated dates can be found in the file MIRA_data_dates.csv.* [IRAS MINOR PLANET SURVEY ASTEROIDS V3.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hnsd-xx6s) - The data presented with this data set include: (a) 8210 individual sightings associated with 2004 asteroids, (b) averaged radiometric diameters and geometric albedos derived from individual observations for 1796 numbered asteroids and 88 unnumbered asteroids (as of 1983) whose orbital elements were determined using astrometry from two or more apparitions; (c) an entry for each of 120 asteroids for which there is an accepted sighting; (d) entries for each of 4677 numbered asteroids and 2632 unnumbered asteroids (as of 1985) for which associations were sought in the IRAS data; (e) A summary of the number of times each asteroid was predicted to be scanned, and possible reasons for any failure to be detected.* [Low-Cost, Lightweight Transpiration-Cooled LOX/CH4 Engine, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wj6z-88au) - The specific impulse of a rocket engine increases as the chamber pressure increases, but so does the heat flux to the chamber wall. Ultimately, this defines the maximum operating pressure for the engine. For regeneratively cooled engines, even those using film cooling, the practical limit has been reached, and further increases in chamber pressure are simply not possible. Transpiration cooling does not have this limitation. Furthermore, because a transpiration-cooled engine pumps only a tiny fraction of the fuel through the wall, a smaller and hence lighter pump can be used, which will significantly reduce the dry mass. Finally, because transpiration cooling can keep the wall much cooler than regenerative cooling with film cooling, a transpiration-cooled engine can use less refractory (i.e., lighter weight) materials, thereby achieving additional reductions in dry mass. The net results are significant increases in the thrust-to-weight ratio and specific impulse and a significant decrease in the dry mass of the system. The perceived limitation of transpiration cooling with a porous wall is coking and blockage of the pores if a carbon-based fuel such as methane is used. In previous work using LOX/H2 propellant, Ultramet showed that with minimal transpiration flow, the wall temperature can be kept well below the point at which methane would form coke. In this project, Ultramet will work with Purdue University to build on previous success with transpiration cooling in LOX/H2 engines and design a lightweight LOX/LCH4 engine in the 10,000- to 25,000-lbf thrust range. The transpiration model will be physics-based and applicable to both LOX/LCH4 and LOX/H2. Key component demonstrators will be fabricated and used to collect empirical data on the thermal, structural, and hydraulic characteristics of the wall architecture. Transpiration rates on subscale hardware will be verified through flow testing, and empirical data will be used to verify the predicted lack of coking.* [Flash 3D Enhancements for Autonomous Precision Landing and Hazard Detection and Avoidance, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u6de-ykyb) - With NASA's exploration initiative to return to Lunar Exploration and eventual human exploration of Mars, NASA has an increased need for advanced Autonomous Precision Landing and Hazard Detection and Avoidance solutions.  Scanning LADAR and stereo video have significant shortcoming while ASC's Flash LADAR 3D video cameras can provide frames of 3D data in real time at video rates.  The proposed high-sensitivity unit cell and ROIC enhances the sensitivity of ASC's standard ROIC by a very large factor as well as decreasing the associated unit cell area by a large factor. This enhancement reduces required laser power, reduces focal plane array power, allows PIN diode arrays to compete with APD detector arrays and increases the number of pixels possible in a given ROIC area.
	Advanced Scientific Concepts Inc. (ASC) is a small business that has developed a number of 3D flash LADAR systems.  Flash Ladar Video Cameras (FLVC) are 3D vision systems that return range and intensity information for each pixel in real time.  The ASC camera with its 128x128 3D array is the equivalent of 16000 range finders on one chip.  This allows the sensor to act as a 3D video camera with functionality well beyond just range finding.  Its small size, low power and fast range data frame rate (30Hz) provides an ideal Landing and Hazard Detection and Avoidance sensor* [Advanced Calibration Source for Planetary and Earth Observing Imaging](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kdwn-9pmd) - <p><strong>Planetary and Earth imaging requires radiometrically calibrated and stable imaging sensors.&nbsp; Radiometric calibration enables the ability to remove or mitigate sensor-specific and environmental anomalies from the data and to convert a sensor&rsquo;s output to common engineering units (e.g. radiance or reflectance).&nbsp; Additionally, radiometric calibration provides the means to compare image sets acquired by multiple sensors at different times and geometries.&nbsp; </strong></p><p><strong>Sensor radiometric calibration and stability is typically accomplished by initially calibrating an imaging sensor in a laboratory before it is fielded or integrated onto a spacecraft and launched.

Working in conjunction with a database of optical properties for known obscurants, the system will be capable of identifying the type and severity of the hazard.  While several different LIDAR ranging techniques are currently employed for airborne detection applications, the RL Associates Inc. hazard detection and mitigation system is based upon our patented range-gated technique used in our FireLidar system.  This technique allows not only detection of obscurants, but can also be used to image through obscurants and thus mitigate the hazard.  RL Associates Inc. is currently leading the industry in shortwave infrared (1.5 um) active imaging systems and plans to use that technology in developing the SWIR LIDAR Hazard Detection System.  This system will be compact and lightweight and will operate around 1.5 um, which is safe to the human eye.* [SMEX03 Soil Texture Data: Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uxcc-amkw) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.

No current compact sensors have the tolerance for liquid water that is specifically required for portable life support systems (PLSS). Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) will develop a luminescence-based optical sensor probe to monitor carbon dioxide, oxygen, and humidity, and selected trace contaminants. Our monitor will incorporate robust CO2, O2, and H2O partial pressure sensors interrogated by a compact, low-power optoelectronic unit. The sensors will not only tolerate liquid water but will actually operate while wet, and can be remotely connected to electronic circuitry by an optical fiber cable immune to electromagnetic interference. For space systems, these miniature sensor elements with remote optoelectronics give unmatched design flexibility for measurements in highly constrained volume systems such as PLSS. Our flow-through monitor design includes an optical sensor we have already developed for PLSS humidity monitoring, and an optical oxygen sensor, both of them based on a common IOS technology. In prior projects IOS has demonstrated a CO2 sensor capable of operating while wet that also met PLSS environmental and analytical requirements, but did not meet life requirements. A new generation of CO2 sensors will be developed to advance this sensor technology and fully meet all NASA requirements, including sensor life. The totally novel approach will overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art luminescent sensors for CO2. Additional sensors will be developed to monitor trace contaminants often found in the ventilation loop as result of material off-gassing or crew member metabolism. IOS has established collaboration with UTC Aerospace Systems to produce prototypes for space qualification, and will conduct extensive testing under simulated space conditions, ensuring a smooth path to technology infusion.* [Rad-Hard and ULP FPGA with "Full" Functionality, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sayx-xaxy) - RNET has demonstrated the feasibility of developing an innovative radiation hardened (RH) and ultra low power (ULP) field programmable gate array (FPGA), called the RH/ULP FPGA.  The design utilizes an advanced SOI process technology.

It is the vision of RNET to develop a family of radiation hardened FPGA products with a variety of features including programmable logic, configurable analog functions, soft/hardcore microprocessor, dedicated DSP functions, I/O, dedicated memory blocks, memory controllers, global clock, and JTAG interface. In addition, specialized circuits for mitigation of TID/temperature effects, radiation hardened by design SEU techniques, and memory scrubbing are planned.  

Our vision at the conclusion of this proposed SBIR is to fabricate a "commercial" RH/ULP FPGA with the most important features listed.  Ideally the FPGA to be developed under the proposed Phase 2 would contain all of these features, but due to the limitation of funds and allotted time, a scaled down version would be completed.  The envisioned device will incorporate the basic programmable logic functions, dedicated block RAM, DSP functions, configurable I/O, global clock distribution network, and JTAG interface.  Phase 2 will set the stage for more feature-rich product families to be developed as commercialization continues.* [Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Liquid-Fueled Rocket Prop...](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xcj3-ysi5) - Title: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Liquid-Fueled Rocket Propulsion Health Monitoring.

Abstract: This article describes the results of applying four unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms to data from two rocket propulsion testbeds. The first testbed uses historical data from the Space Shuttle Main Engine. The second testbed uses data from an experimental rocket engine test stand located at NASA Stennis Space Center. The article describes nine anomalies detected by the four algorithms. The four algorithms use four different definitions of anomalousness. Orca uses a nearest-neighbor approach, defining a point to be an anomaly if its nearest neighbors in the data space are far away from it. The Inductive Monitoring System clusters the training data, and then uses the distance to the nearest cluster as its measure of anomalousness. GritBot learns rules from the training data, and then classifies points as anomalous if they violate these rules. One-class support vector machines map the data into a high-dimensional space in which most of the normal points are on one side of a hyperplane, and then classify points on the other side of the hyperplane as anomalous. Because of these different definitions of anomalousness, different algorithms detect different anomalies. We therefore conclude that it is useful to use multiple algorithms.* [Innoflight Middleware System (IMS), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7ihm-8kah) - Space missions can benefit greatly from the use of the latest COTS processing technology in order to allow spacecraft to perform more onboard computation using less power.  This trend has accelerated in recent years due to the explosion of low-power commercial processing technology driven by mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.  Many of these advanced devices contain multiple processing cores, and some are full System-on-Chip (SoC) parts that include GPU processor arrays or FPGA fabric.
However, while these COTS multi-core processors have tremendous capability, they are not designed to be tolerant to the radiation effects that are experienced in the space environment.  One approach to increasing the reliability of COTS processors in space is to implement redundancy within the software framework.  With this technique, the multiple cores in a processing device and even multiple independent computers can be operated in any combination of parallel processing (for enhanced performance) and redundantly (for enhanced reliability).  For this proposed project, we plan to develop the Innoflight Middleware System (IMS) in order to provide this capability.* [Theoretically Optimal Distributed Anomaly Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ht3u-kjpr) - A novel general framework for distributed anomaly detection with theoretical performance guarantees is proposed. Our algorithmic approach combines existing anomaly detection procedures with a novel method for computing global statistics using local sufficient statistics. Under a Gaussian assumption, our distributed algorithm is guaranteed to perform as well as its centralized counterpart, a condition we call Ôzero information lossÕ. We further report experimental results on synthetic as well as real-world data to demonstrate the viability of our approach.* [U.S. Population Grids (Summary File 1), 2000: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, Alpha Version](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q5sn-2g23) - U.S. Population Grids (Summary File 1), 2000: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, Alpha Version contains an ARC/INFO Workspace with grids of   demographic data from the year 2000 census. The grids have a resolution of 30 arc-seconds (0.0083 decimal degrees), or approximately 1 square km. The gridded variables are based on census   block geography from Census 2000 TIGER/Line Files and census variables (population, households, and housing variables). This dataset is produced by the Columbia University Center for   International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [ANSIBLE: A Network of Social Interactions for Bilateral Life Enhancement, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/x3ic-v679) - Studies in ground-based analogs of Isolated and Confined Environments (ICE) have identified sensory monotony and social isolation as threats to crew psychological well-being.  Further, the lack of real-time communications in future missions will impact crew interactions with their support systems, i.e. family, friends, and colleagues, are critical.  ANSIBLE (A Network of Social Interactions for Bilateral Life Enhancement) leverages evidence based strategies to 1) augment asynchronous communications using Virtual Environments (VEs) and facilitate novel interaction methods beyond email, 2) use the inherently immersive and stimuli rich nature of VEs to counteract sensory monotony, and 3) leverages VEs and intelligent Virtual Agents (VAs) as companions and advisors to combat social monotony and detect changes in astronaut psychosocial states can increase astronaut self-awareness, suggest countermeasures, and provide rehearsal scenarios to maintain and enhance interpersonal skills.  Along with Dr. Morie, SIFT will leverage its prior work with human communication models and unobtrusive detection of psychosocial dimensions, to enhance VE and VA technologies. The resulting tool will advance  the future social landscape that connects the flight crew with Earth, and can be used pre, during, and post flight to connect crew and ground, providing a sense of social consistency and permanence.* [Onboard Generic Fault Detection Algorithm Development and Demonstration for VTOL sUAS, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xwv7-ssua) - In the proposed SBIR study, Empirical Systems Aerospace, Inc. (ESAero) will develop a fault detection and identification avionics system implementing a generic statistical fault detection algorithm and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through flight testing on board a VTOL UAV testbed. The algorithm is aimed to be generic in the sense that it is agnostic to the specific platform or avionics suite on which it is implemented, making the developed technology broadly applicable to VTOL aircraft configurations, other aircraft types, and beyond. Using a statistics-based method, the system will not need to have direct knowledge of the sensors, the system, or the vehicle configuration. By simply monitoring the available sensors and comparing their signals to a trained nominal statistical data model, abnormalities in systems, sub-systems and individual components can be detected before a major failure occurs, greatly improving system operational safety and potentially significantly reducing maintenance costs. To develop the fault detection system, the team will leverage previous ePHM (Prognostic and Health Management) investment and configure a COTS VTOL UAV with a sensor suite and onboard data acquisition and processing system. The team will operate this VTOL UAV testbed to acquire data for nominal operation and then intentionally inject failures into the system to gather data for various faulty operations. The algorithm will be adapted to this dataset and loaded onto the testbed. Finally, in Phase I, ESAero will demonstrate the fault detection algorithm in flight verifying that the algorithm is capable of both detecting and identifying faults during actual operation. In Phase II, ESAero envisions further productionizing the technology by working with commercial motor and speed control vendors to broaden the statistical dataset and miniaturize the sensor and processing modules with the goal to integrate into existing hardware offerings.* [Highly Adaptive Primary Mirror Having Embedded Actuators, Sensors, and Neural Control, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cziz-kepq) - Xinetics has demonstrated the technology required to fabricate a self-compensating highly adaptive silicon carbide primary mirror system having embedded actuators, sensors, and neural control with an areal density less that 10Kg/m2. The system architecture complete with feedback sensors, and neural algorithm was conceived, modeled and tested, and appears scaleable to 10-30meter class deployable systems. Highly adaptive telescopes require self-compensating telescope components to enable autonomously optimized optical trains to achieve very low total system wavefront error. High sensitivity semiconductor strain gages were shown to have adequate resolution for shape control. Resistance RTD sensors were shown to provide more than adequate temperature sensitivity. Analysis of strain gage placement conducted during this Phase I showed that the strain sensors required for neural control will require very high precision strain measurement (less than 1 microstrain), potential sensors were tested and characterized. Phase I data acquisition system limitations prevented full closed loop hardware demonstration. As a result Xinetics demonstrated the closed loop function using FEA analysis to provide simulated data to train the MATLAB based neural control algorithm. Phase I results show very encouraging performance and provide design information for a solid technical plan for full hardware demonstration in a phase II.* [Diagnosis-Driven Prognosis for Decision Making, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4jwb-x9pm) - In Phase II, the QSI-Vanderbilt team seeks to develop a system-level diagnostics and prognostic process that incorporates a "sense and respond capability," which first uses error codes and discrete sensor values to correctly diagnose the system health including degradations and failures of sensors and components, and then invokes appropriate prognostics routines for the assessment of RUL and performance capability. The QSI-Vanderbilt team plans to emphasize advancement in the following five areas: (a) leverage extensive LADEE telemetry data to further enhance and develop online degradation profiles, performance analysis and remaining useful life (RUL) computation algorithms, (b) develop/implement degradation detection algorithms to compute time-to-alarm (TTA) and time-to-maintenance (TTM) predictions and correlate with alarm/maintenance events, (c) develop reusable library of models and tests, (d) verification and validation of the resulting solution, and (e) demonstrate the proposed solution on LADEE's and other spacecraft subsystems. Once fully developed, outcomes of this effort will lower the cost of developing prognostics and provide maximum critical system availability, smarter scheduling of maintenance, overall logistics support cost, and optimal match of assets to missions. The proposed offering will also provide a cost-effective and pragmatic solution to our commercial customers who want to reduce unscheduled downtime by practicing condition based maintenance, but cannot justify the cost of developing prognostic methods in the conventional way.* [Cardiovascular Imaging and Strategies to Mitigate the Risk for Cardiac Events in Astronauts During Prolonged Spaceflight](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qia2-6ac8) - All aims have been accomplished. Because this section will be made publicly available, a modified selection from "main findings" is reproduced here.     
1). DEFINED HOW TO QUANTIFY PROGRESSION OF CAC: The most common clinical definition of >15% per year, which is used by NASA flight surgeons, is too sensitive to the baseline CAC and frequently gives erroneous information, especially in patients with low baseline levels of CAC (for example an increase of 1 to 2, 10 to 11, or 100 to 101 reflect a 100%, 10%, and 1% change, but would still reflect the same absolute change in CAC). Different methods can result in divergent classification in up to 30% of individuals. Although we could not define the "best" score, the Hokanson method, based on the square root of the change in CAC, seemed to be the most robust, and will be utilized in other publications. This paper has been accepted in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC): Imaging; Paixao ARM...Levine BD et al. Disagreement Between Different Definitions of Coronary Artery Calcium Progression. JACC: Imaging, 2014, in press.     
2). MADE THE NOVEL, CLINICALLY IMPORTANT OBSERVATION THAT THE FINAL CAC SCORE, RATHER THAN A MEASURE OF DISEASE PROGRESSION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION FOR PREDICTING CLINICAL EVENTS. So if serial CAC scanning is performed by flight surgeons, the latest scan should be used for risk assessment; knowledge of the change in CAC leading to this subsequent score will provide no independent prognostic information. This new finding obviates the need for complex calculations regarding rate of progression, and emphasizes that risk for future events depends mainly on the overall atherosclerotic burden, not on how fast the diseases progresses.

4). DEVELOPED THE ASTRO-CHARM (Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification). This score is the only system available which quantifies global cardiovascular risk in a relatively young population like the astronaut corps, using routine clinical information plus a CAC score. The final results from Astro-CHARM, including the functional calculator were delivered to NASA and the Human Research Program (HRP) in February 2014, and is actively being used by flight surgeons now.

Trade studies have been performed for these small satellites, and optimization of the propulsion system with respect to mass shows that cold-gas systems will result in the lowest overall system mass despite their low specific impulse. One way to improve the overall performance of a cold-gas propulsion system without suffering a weight penalty is to use Tridyney instead of helium or nitrogen cold gas. Tridyne, a non-explosive mixture of nitrogen (or helium), hydrogen, and oxygen, offers a 20-28% increase in specific impulse over nitrogen. The limitation of Tridyne for small satellites is that the particle size of commonly used granular catalysts is unsuitably large for use in a micronewton thruster. Coarse particles will result in propellant channeling with little reaction taking place, and a loss of performance. In this project, Ultramet proposes to build upon its experience with monolithic catalyst beds and develop a small, low pressure drop, monolithic catalyst bed optimized for use with Tridyne.* [Development of Advanced Detonation Modeling Methods for Hydrocarbon Propellants, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qz3i-5p4q) - Many modern liquid rocket propulsion systems are utilizing hydrocarbon propellants (e.g. methane, RP-1). Testing of these new rocket systems will inherently involve the potential for large energy explosions. Current engineering methods do not address the probability of a detonation occurring and they are extremely conservative by attempting to equate the propellant vapor cloud explosion to a high-density explosive. The current project is leveraging CIF FY15 work done by NASA-SSC in which a validated tool for modeling hydrogen detonation and blast wave propagations in test facilities by following on to validate engineering level approaches for modeling the potential and associated blast environments for explosions of these hydrocarbon propellants.* [Measurement and Assessment of Flow Quality in Wind Tunnels, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/eaev-rahe) - New wind tunnel flow quality test and analysis procedures have been developed and will be used to establish standardized turbulent flow quality measurement techniques and data reduction procedures for future flow quality studies in the National Transonic Wind Tunnel (NTF) and other Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) facilities.  To date, few measurements have been made of the characteristics of freestream turbulence in transonic wind tunnels, and details of the amplitude and spectra of freestream velocity and pressure fluctuations is lacking.  Consequently, there is an urgent need for in-situ measurements to determine flow quality and the performance of turbulence and noise suppression devices. This information is required if we are to accurately assess and characterize ground test facility performance. To meet these challenges, a unique research program is proposed to clarify and alleviate the aerodynamic problems associated with adverse wind tunnel flow quality.  It combines innovative advances in data base assessment and management, and new approaches to turbulence instrumentation and analysis.  Standardized turbulence measurement techniques and data analysis procedures will be established and used to document the flow quality in our major test facilities.* [GPM GROUND VALIDATION AUTONOMOUS PARSIVEL UNIT (APU) NSSTC V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wjbd-uwww) - The GPM Ground Validation Autonomous Parsivel Unit (APU) NSSTC dataset was collected by the Autonomous Parsivel Unit (APU), which is an optical disdrometer based on single particle extinction that measures particle size and fall velocity. This APU consists of the Parsivel, which was developed by OTT in Germany, and its support systems, which were designed and built by the University of Alabama in Huntsville. This dataset provides rainfall data for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission Ground Validation Experiment collected at the National Space Science Technology Center (NSSTC) in Huntsville, Alabama. The validation effort will entail numerous GPM-specific and joint-agency/international external field campaigns, using state of the art cloud and precipitation observational infrastructure. Surface rainfall will be measured by very dense rain gauge and disdrometer networks at various field campaign sites. There may be occasional gaps in the data when the instrument is not resident at the NSSTC and is sent to participate in field campaigns.* [CER_BDS_Terra-FM1_Edition4](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pwwz-g739) - The Edition4 CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) for Flight Model 1 (FM1) on the Terra spacecraft (CER_BDS_Terra-FM1_Edition4) data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.

Because of forgetfulness, this person may realize activities of daily living erroneously. In order to assist this person automatically in Smart Home, all his performed actions and activities are observed through the embedded sensors of Smart Home, and applying the data mining techniques his activities are analyzed. Then information about his activities is provided and in the consequence, comparing learned correct patterns and current observations the Smart Home may infer provision of assistance to this person at the appropriate moment. In this paper we propose a data-driven activity modeling approach, which supports reasoning in correct realization of the activities. Activities are presumed as the series of fuzzy events that occur shortly one after another. Per each activity, we calculate a fuzzy conceptual structure, and the model of activity is represented in form of a multivariable problem.* [Lunar Health Monitor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/crmd-cpcq) - Orbital Research has successfully demonstrated a dry electrode (no electrolyte or gel required) for heart rate and ECG monitoring.  Preliminary data has indicated that the electrode can be incorporated into a garment that does not require an adhesive for successful data collection.  Further preliminary data indicates that respiration rate can be deduced from the ECG waveform captured from the dry electrodes. The Orbital Lunar Health Monitor (LHM) will incorporate the patented dry electrode with other commercially available sensors in a garment resulting in fully wearable monitor of Astronaut Health.  The data from each of the sensor is processed, yielding a comprehensive image of overall health. Environment sensors are also incorporated to detect longer term health threats.  The LHM is comfortable and non-inhibiting. The Orbital Lunar Health Monitor is intended to enable continuous monitoring of health status of Astronauts both in  intra- and extra-vehicular sorties.* [NACP Regional: National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Aggregated Gridded Model Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/stn9-87jb) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides two products that were derived from the recently published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis 1-degree terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs (Gridded 1-deg Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et al., 2013). The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional Synthesis - Description of Observations and Models.* [Rapid Development of Flight Software for a Complete Guidance, Navigation, and Control Subsystem Using Simulinkâs Auto-coding Capabilities](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8yqb-e8h3) - <p>The proposed task will create new processes and tools for automatically generating flight code for the entire Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) subsystem&nbsp;using the approach of&nbsp;translating GNC models generated by commercially available modeling and simulation tool(s) into multiple&nbsp;software applications for&nbsp;the standard&nbsp;flight software (FSW) architecture used by the Goddard Space Flight Center.

We will define the data and control interfaces between the spacecraft flight software system and the GNC truth model in this task.</p>* [A Multi-Media, Computer-Based, Self-Directed, Autonomous, Stress and
Anxiety-Management Countermeasure](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9rgt-r3c9) - <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
                      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<p>1. Original Project aims/objectives: Stress and anxiety-related
  problems are some of the most common and costly behavioral health
  problems in society. For those working in operational environments
  (i.e., astronauts, flight controllers, military), stress and
  anxiety-related problems before, during, or after missions can
  seriously compromise efficiency, safety, and performance. To address
  behavioral health issues like stress, it is important to maximize the
  privacy, validity, and acceptability of the countermeasures used. Our
  project had two specific aims: 1) to develop an evidence-based,
  autonomous, multimedia program to train users to manage stress and
  build resilience; 2) to evaluate the program in a randomized
  controlled trial (RCT). The program is called SMART-OP (Stress
  Management and Resilience Training for Optimal Performance). The
  six-session cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based program includes
  education about stress, and interactive training exercises that teach
  users to monitor stress, regulate emotions and relax, think flexibly,
  be realistic, and take effective action to deal with stressors. The
  content of the program can be modified to target different populations
  who work in challenging environments (e.g., astronauts, military, and
  flight controllers) and could be disseminated widely via computer,
  tablet, or smartphone. 2. Key Findings: We recently evaluated SMART-OP
  in an RCT with a sample of stressed but otherwise healthy University
  of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Law and Business School students
  (N=66). SMART-OP was compared to an attention control (AC) group that
  received marketed stress management information (i.e., videos and
  reading material). Interested participants were screened to ensure
  they met study eligibility criteria (no medical or psychiatric
  conditions, were stressed based on a self-report stress score, and a
  UCLA graduate student). Two hundred and thirty individuals expressed
  interest in the study, 169 were screened, and 80 were eligible.
  Participants (N = 66) were randomized to SMART-OP or AC and were
  evaluated on self-report measures and performance on The Trier Social
  Stress Test (TSST). Participants also evaluated the program for
  usefulness and usability. Fifty-nine participants completed all
  training sessions and assessments. The SMART-OP group reported
  significantly less stress, more perceived control over stress, and
  rated the program as significantly more useful than the AC group.
  During the TSST, the SMART-OP group showed a more adaptive within-task
  recovery at post-assessment based on a-amylase data (a biomarker of
  stress). SMART-OP received an excellent score on a measure of
  usability. 3. Impact of key findings on hypotheses, technology
  requirements, objectives, and specific aims of the original proposal:
  Our RCT key findings indicate that SMART-OP is highly usable and is a
  more effective and useful stress management training program than an
  educational comparison. These findings support our initial hypotheses
  that the self-guided interactive multimedia stress management and
  resilience training program would be a useful and acceptable method of
  training to the user, and an effective stress management
  countermeasure. Our findings are consistent with the growing
  literature on technology-based behavioral health interventions which
  report that such programs are effective and acceptable forms of
  treatment. SMART-OP only requires a computer for use so it can be used
  confidentially at a time and place of the user's choosing. The program
  can also be modified for use by nearly any population as well as
  tablet or smartphone platforms. We also met our two main aims and
  objectives of our original proposal-- to develop an evidence-based
  autonomous,* [Biosensors for Exploration Medical System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/78hr-6r2q) - The current International Space Station (ISS) ECG (electrocardiogram) system for donning the biomedical sensors is time consuming and inconvenient, requiring shaving, application of electrodes, and signal checks. A more efficient ECG system will save crew time and reduce the overhead of stowing additional supplies. Additionally, the current ECG hardware requires dedicated ISS power and significant volume, but advances in microelectronics has significantly reduced the volume and power required for ECG applications.  The Biosensors-EMSD (Exploration Medical System Demonstration) will demonstrate the integration of small, battery powered, easy to use biomedical sensors and data acquisition devices that will have the ability to measure, store, and transmit physiologic parameters during operational and ambulatory scenarios.    
Specific Aims:     
1. Demonstrate that commercial off the shelf (COTS) and emerging technologies satisfy exploration physiological monitoring requirements and operational requirements    
2. Reduce the time required of an on-orbit crew and ground personnel to store, access, transfer, and process physiological data    
3. Provide a mechanism for interfacing biomedical sensor technology with a common data management framework and architecture to enable the EMSD objectives.    
The functionality of the ECG system will be verified through a ground demonstration and an ISS flight demonstration, both as part of the Exploration Medical System Demonstration.  The project will begin with a market survey of available COTS ECG systems that meet physiological monitoring requirements followed by a direct COTS procurement.  The ECG system will then be tested and verified for proper capabilities by CMO analogs.  Ground testing will require CMO analogs to don the ECG system and execute a series of predetermined tasks while a variety of ECG data and video is collected.  ECG data and video will be examined to ensure data quality, appropriate data routing, and to demonstrate system efficiency.  Flight testing will be similar to ground testing, but may not be as comprehensive given in-flight resource limitations.  The availability of more varied medical condition simulations, more extensive supply of power, fewer time and space limitations, and enhanced system characterization capabilities will allow the ground demonstration to expand the on-orbit objectives by assessing system effectiveness and performance.* [Autonomous Melt-Probe Penetration of Dirty Ice with Clean Sampling for Life Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c7pf-2ivu) - Access to subsurface material and oceans through water-ice crusts is a goal common to exploration of all ocean worlds. Probes that melt their way through ice are, thus far, the only technology demonstrated to penetrate ice autonomously to depths on the order of kilometers, as will be required to reach an ocean on, e.g., Europa. Moreover, melt probes operate in ice at all relevant temperatures, with internal temperatures for electronics and instrumentation near 273K. Such probes are thus strong candidates for subsurface access and life detection on ocean worlds.

However, an ocean worlds melt probe will have to penetrate ice laden with particulates from, e.g., meteoritic or comet dust infall, which accumulate in front of the probe, insulate the melt head, and arrest progress. At the same time, the probe must acquire melt- or ocean-water samples and deliver them without contamination to life-detection instruments. These functions must be accomplished under more severe constraints on power (in foreseeable landed systems) than previous melt probes can meet.

Melt probe power requirements decrease rapidly with decreasing size. We show that a probe with dimensions near those of our small, newly field-tested probe could attain meter-per-hour descent speeds on ocean worlds, even at 100K temperature, using thermal power comparable to that generated radiogenically in a General Purpose Heat Source. Such speeds are sufficient to reach kilometers-deep subglacial water within a nominal 30-day lander life time.

Such an approach would entail major commitments of engineering effort and national resources of plutonium. Precisely because the commitments would be large, it is critical to establish first that essential, component-level functions of subsurface exploration can actually be demonstrated in sufficiently small probes. Primary technical risks on a path to flight hardware therefore entail simplification and size-reduction of hardware to penetrate ‘dirty’ ice, and to acquire ‘clean’ samples for life-detection. The objective of this project is retirement of those risks.

We bring to this work unique experience in each component. Two members of our team have developed a simple, robust probe, which has reached 400 m depth in Greenland and demonstrated penetration rates of 6.6 meters per hour (these are the second-greatest depth and highest speed achieved by melt probes on Earth to date). We have demonstrated autonomous descent based on the geometry and power-balance in our probe, rather than computationally intensive control algorithms. Our third team member has developed and tested in Antarctica a melt-probe based, microbiologically and geochemically clean sampling system, the size and complexity of which we will reduce.

Our specific objectives are thus: (1) to develop a simplified pump and jetting mechanism (currently TRL 3), integrate it with our field-tested melt probe (TRL 4), and to quantify in the laboratory, the characteristics of particle-laden ice that the system can penetrate as a function of jetting parameters; (2) to develop, initially also in the laboratory, clean acquisition and transfer of water samples (currently TRL 3-4 based on Antarctic field experience); and finally (3) to demonstrate dirty ice penetration and clean sampling in an integrated system small enough to be powered radiogenically on ocean worlds, and in a relevant environment (to a depth of 50 m on a dusty alpine glacier in Washington State, with our exit TRL at or approaching TRL 5).

We presently envision the next step toward mission implementation to be testing in ice simulating that on ocean-worlds surface at relevant temperatures. We are in active conversation with the JPL Space Technology Program Office on mission implementation.* [STARwatch to Deliver Objective Sleep Measures for Spaceflight Operations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8frb-eu93) - This project will achieve a wrist-worn actigraphy device called STARwatch, designed specifically for space exploration environments. It will provide a minimally obtrusive, objective measure that evaluates astronaut sleep-wake activity and light exposure. This project will leverage our second generation actigraphy device that has already been validated in controlled laboratory experiments against gold-standard polysomnography. The compact wrist-worn device includes sensors to collect sleep metrics and will also serve as a wireless hub to collect real-time physiological data from other body-worn sensors (e.g., heart rate, EEG). It will use standardized wireless communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth) to automatically uplink data to the ISS network (no astronaut time required). Data will automatically be integrated into medical operations support systems (e.g., BHP-Dashboard) to provide immediate feedback to astronauts and flight surgeons to aid in decision-making relative to astronaut medical, behavioral health and performance issues. During Phase I, we will develop an enhanced STARwatch, integrate data from other body worn sensors (e.g., heart rate sensor), demonstrate automatic data streaming using approaches compatible with the ISS network environment, and develop a plan for operational validation and spaceflight certification that will be implemented during Phase II (Phase I TRL of 4-5).* [Non-Invasive Transcranial Doppler Sonogram Device for Detection of Embolic Air in Cerebral Arteries, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2bpv-jz6p) - Technology is needed to provide real-time assessment and evaluation of hematological parameters during prolong space flights and planetary missions.  A key hematological parameter is the monitoring and measurement of emboli in the brain especially during Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) on planetary surfaces as well as orbital flights. A non-invasive, compact Transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurement device will provide monitoring of flight crew blood physiology during extended duration missions and deliver this data to onboard flight surgeons.  

To address this need, GeneXpress Informatics (GXI) and Leonid Bunegin and Dr. Claudia S. Miller of the University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSC) at San Antonio proposes to develop a non-invasive, portable TCD sonogram based diagnostic system for real-time monitoring and detection of cerebral artery air embolisms.   The detection system uses intensity audio signals and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to detect and locate the TCD audio signals of air bubbles in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). 

In Phase I, GXI proposes to develop and demonstrate the non-invasive use TCD measurements for the determination of air emboli.  In Phase II, GXI will proceed to a prototype development which will include construction and fabrication of a handheld field portable frequency-domain TCD measurement system.* [Drill Embedded Nanosensors for Planetary Subsurface Exploration](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q4uy-cbfr) - <p>We have developed a carbon nanotube (CNT) sensor for water vapor detection under Martian Conditions and the miniaturized electronics can be embedded in the drill bit for collecting sensor data and transmitting it to a computer wirelessly. This capability will enable the real time measurement of ice during drilling. With this real time and in-situ measurement, subsurface ice detection can be easy, fast, precise and low cost.<p/><p>Current methods for sensing icy deposits on Mars or the moon include volume hydrogen measurements in a 1m3 volume from a surface neutron spectrometer, optical spectral measurements to identify water spectral lines, or direct analysis of samples using mass spectroscopy. The latter two methods require samples to be on the surface or fed into an instrument. The detection limit of optical spectroscopy is ~1% water ice in a cuttings mixture. In contrast CNT sensor's detection limit is 10-6 – 10-9 and the sensors are tiny with significantly lower power usage compared to other instruments. The drill mounted CNT sensor can also detect ice as it is encountered by the drill bit at very low concentrations, obtaining fine scale information on the vertical structure of the icy material. Potentially, CNT sensors combined with drilling afford a new approach for detection and measurement of volatiles. With CIF support in 2013, we started with CNT sensors that operate under Earth conditions optimized to sense organic volatiles and developed a CNT sensor capable of detecting water vapor, requiring special coatings applied to the CNT.  We characterized the sensor performance under Mars pressure (~6mbar) and temperature (-45oC) conditions, showing that it could detect small quantities of water vapor introduced into its vicinity. We compared our CNT sensor with commercially available RH sensors. The test results show that commercial sensors do not work under vacuum conditions. So, our CNT sensors exceed the performance of these commercial sensors for Martian conditions.   We miniaturized the sensor, and constructed data acquisition and wireless communication electronics to fit inside a drill string.  The wireless communications allows us to transmit the CNT sensor signal from the borehole without bringing wires through the rotating interface. We then constructed a simulated borehole and drill string and tested sensor performance detecting small quantities of water vapor under Martian conditions. The wireless communication board can transmit the sensor data to a USB receiver plugged into a computer for data streaming. The work remaining is to complete sensor installation into a drill string and test it drilling into icy material in a Mars environment, which requires a Mars chamber that requires use of unique Mars drill testing facilities at Honeybee Robotics.  Possible applications of CNT sensors for water detection include prospecting for buried ice on the Moon, and characterizing feedstocks for ISRU on the moon or Mars.  An ISRU demonstration proposal to the Mars 2020 rover has expressed interest.  CNT borehole instruments that detect volatiles like methane should interest the fuels industry.</p>* [CERES Bidirectional Scans Terra FM1 Edition3](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dwud-6dtt) - CER_BDS_Terra-FM1_Edition3 data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.Each Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data product contains twenty-four hours of Level-1b data for each CERES scanner instrument mounted on each spacecraft. The BDS includes samples taken in normal and short Earth scan elevation profiles in both fixed and rotating azimuth scan modes (including space, internal calibration, and solar calibration views). The BDS contains Level-0 raw (unconverted) science and instrument data as well as the geolocated converted science and instrument data. The BDS contains additional data not found in the Level-0 input file, including converted satellite position and velocity data, celestial data, converted digital status data, and parameters used in the radiance count conversion equations.      CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful  Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002. The newest CERES instrument (FM5) was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011.* [MINERVA: Using Small, Fully Robotic Telescopes to Search for Habitable-Zone Exoplanets](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i6b6-kerz) - The 2010 Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics declared that a program to identify nearby, terrestrial planets with the possibility for liquid water and oxygen in the atmosphere is of top priority. Finding these planets poses significant technical challenges. Firstly, nearly all current instruments lack the sensitivity to detect habitable-zone planets with masses less than five times that of Earth’s. Secondly, a planet’s radius and mass, and thus its density and internal composition, can only be estimated through the combined data from both transit and radial velocity measurements. Thirdly and most considerably, definitive detection of such planets requires the observations of many orbits in order to obtain a time-averaged signal. This level of cadence is unfeasible in the existing framework of shared telescope time, and currently there are few observatories dedicated to exoplanet science.

The Minerva project will address these limitations by building a ground-based telescope array, capable of both transit science and radial velocimetry, dedicated to the detection of terrestrial planets around nearby stars. Four 0.7-meter telescopes will each be equipped with an imaging camera and will fiber-feed to a single high-resolution spectrometer. The multi-telescope model affords Minerva the flexibility to observe in formation, with a synthesized aperture of 1.4m, or take simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric measurements.

Perhaps the most unique feature of Minerva will be its availability to search for planets every single clear night. To accomplish this, the observatory will be fully robotic; all components of the telescope array and instrument suite will need to operate autonomously. The Minerva software will control multiple telescopes and a number of instruments simultaneously, requiring precise synchronization and complex data handling. The system must be robust and efficient in recovering from any errors encountered. My task is to lead the design of the Minerva software, thereby solving the problem of how to efficiently and robustly manage a complex distributed-aperture robotic observatory with an extensive instrument suite. I plan to base the software architecture on the modular and highly efficient model developed for Robo-AO, a successfully operating fully robotic adaptive optics system. I have personally developed routines for Robo-AO and hope to adapt the system to meet Minerva’s unique requirements.

Minerva will directly address a multitude of technical challenges put forth by NASA’s Space Technology Roadmaps. Firstly, the distributed-aperture model is immediately matched to TA8.2.3: Distributed Aperture Observatories. Secondly, the complex robotic system will necessarily advance technologies in the field of autonomy, specifically the following areas:  TA4.5.4: Multi-Agent Coordination, TA4.5.2: Dynamic Planning and Sequencing Tools, and finally TA4.5.3: Autonomous Guidance and Control.* [Advanced Ground Systems Maintenance Anomaly Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uf5b-v8n4) - <p>The Inductive Monitoring System (IMS) software utilizes techniques from the fields of model-based reasoning, machine learning, and data mining to build system monitoring knowledge bases from archived or simulated sensor data. Unlike some other machine learning techniques, IMS does not require examples of anomalous (failure) behavior. IMS automatically analyzes nominal system data to form general classes of expected system sensor values. This process enables the software to inductively learn and model nominal system behavior. The generated data classes are then used to build a monitoring knowledge base. In real-time,</p><p>IMS performs monitoring functions, determining and displaying the degree of deviation from nominal performance. IMS trend analyses can detect conditions that may indicate a failure or required system maintenance. The development of the IMS was motivated by the difficulty of producing detailed diagnostic models of some system components due to complexity or unavailability of design information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project will develop the capability to identify anomalous conditions (indications to potential impending system failure) in ground system operations before such failures occur. These indicators are not presently detectable by traditional command and control and fault detection systems. &nbsp;This project enables the delivery of system&#39;s health advisories to ground system operators so they can take action prior to experiencing systems failures.&nbsp;Inductive Monitoring System (IMS)&nbsp;detected&nbsp;anomalies can be sent to a diagnostic software&nbsp;module for diagnosis.</p><p>Anomaly Detection provides the 21st Century Launch Complex Program with the ability to identify/recognize systems&#39; anomalies before they become faults in the system; it supports the resolution of such anomalies to assure system availability and mission success. This capability also allows reduction in systems&#39; maintenance costs by dictating when maintenance is needed (Maintenance-on-Demand) versus performing maintenance on schedule.&nbsp;</p>* [Ocean Color Underwater Low Light Advanced Radiometer—Ocean Color at Night](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yw4d-fs6h) - <p>The OCULLAR activity pairs a miniature and ruggedized photomultiplier tube (PMT) with an existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) silicon photodetector (SiP) microradiometer (co-developed by the PI as part of a prior SBIR) to create a new class of&nbsp; sensor technology called a <em>hybridnamic multitecto</em>r. A SiP microradiometer has a spectral responsivity spanning 305-1,640 nm with 10 decades of dynamic range and can be pointed at the Sun, Moon, sky, or sea without saturating. The principal OCULLAR objective is to increase this dynamic range to 14 decades with demonstrated linear calibration. The extra 6 decades of dynamic range from the PMT (2 overlap with the SiP, netting 14 decades) significantly improve the measurement of apparent optical properties (AOPs) under moonlight, which has already been demonstrated to be possible with existing SiP microradiometers, although there are challenges with ultraviolet (UV) channels. Increasing the dynamic range of the sensors will overcome the present limitations and allow unprecedented new research. For example, diurnal processes in the ocean and atmosphere can be studied optically using moonlight as the light source.</p> <p>The principal objective of the OCULLAR project is to pair a PMT with a SiP microradiometer where their overlapping sensitivities maximize the dynamic range at each wavelength to create a new hybrid sensor class, called a <em>hybridnamic multitecto</em>r.&nbsp; Ultimately, hybridnamic multitectors will feature up to 14 decades of dynamic range, spanning the UV to near-infrared (NIR), depending on the photocathode material of the PMT, and will be used to measure the AOPs of the ocean and atmosphere. AOP measurements, by definition, require a light source. Typically, the Sun is used because it provides sufficient flux across an extensive spectral domain for a wide diversity of detectors. Although some measurements have been made using the Moon as a light source, in general, the diurnal cycle of oceanic and atmospheric optical parameters are poorly understood, because of the paucity of instruments that can make high-quality observations in low-light conditions. Similarly, observations in highly turbid conditions are sparse, because signal levels quickly reach the noise level of existing detector systems. The inability to make accurate measurements at low-light levels has restricted the understanding of other important light-based phenomena. This means high latitude processes can be investigated during the substantial time of the year when light levels are restricted to twilight, moonlight, or very low solar elevations. Other areas of new research using OCULLAR sensors include the study of coral spawning, plankton vertical migration, bioluminescence, the onset of the spring bloom under polar ice sheets, characterization of the environment experienced by pelagic predators (e.g., tuna and squid), plus the use of very narrow bandwidths to exploit specific spectral signatures of oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Although the prototype sensor is anticipated to be deployed into the ocean, recent advances in exploiting microradiometers for airborne applications (e.g., C-AIR flights with Ames Research Center), suggests <em>Ocean Color at Night</em> or <em>Validating the Black Marble</em> using OCULLAR sensors are tractable problems.</p>* [Intelligent Temporal Data Driven World Actuation in Ambient Environments Case Study: Anomaly Recognition and Assistance Provision in Smart Home](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bway-y43c) - Abstract — A possible resident of smart home is an old person or an Alzheimer patient that should be assisted continuously for the rest of his life; however, normally this person desires to live independently at home. Typically, this person may forget sometimes completion of the activities; may realize the activities of daily living incorrectly, and may enter to dangerous states. In this context smart home project is proposed as an ambient intelligent environment, in which on one hand the resident is observed continuously through the embedded sensors, and on the other hand the resident is assisted automatically through the embedded electronically controllable actuators. In this work, we propose an approach to interpret the sensors’ observations and how to automatically reason in the required assistance. The result is provision of automated assistance for the smart home resident.* [Ground-Based Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) Observation Data (full-rate, daily, 24 hour files) from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jyds-z6r6) - This dataset consists of ground-based Satellite Laser Ranging observation data (full-rate, daily 24 hour files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). SLR provides unambiguous range measurements to mm precision that can be aggregated over the global network to provide very accurate satellite orbits, time histories of station position and motion, and many other geophysical parameters. SLR operates in the optical region and is the only space geodetic technique that measures unambiguous range directly. Analysis of SLR data contributes to the terrestrial reference frame, modeling of the spatial and temporal variations of the Earth's gravitational field, and monitoring of millimeter-level variations in the location of the center of mass of the total Earth system (solid Earth-atmosphere-oceans). In addition, SLR provides precise orbit determination for spaceborne radar altimeter missions. It provides a means for sub-nanosecond global time transfer, and a basis for special tests of the Theory of General Relativity. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) retrieve SLR data on regular schedules to produce precise station positions and velocities for stations in the ILRS network. The daily SLR full-rate observation files contain data received in the previous 24-hour period from a global network of stations ranging to satellites equipped with retroreflectors. Data are available in ILRS data format (older data sets) and/or the Consolidated Ranging Data (CRD) format. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/SLR/Full-rate_data.html.* [Air-to-Air UAV Aerial Refueling](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fp2g-zn8q) - <p>Armstrong researchers, in cooperation with Northrop Grumman Corporation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) demonstrated autonomous aerial refueling between two unmanned, high-altitude aircraft. NASA's two Global Hawk UAVs, one outfitted as a receiver and the other as a tanker, flew a series of demonstration flights to validate advanced UAV-to-UAV aerial refueling control system technology. The two Global Hawk aircraft successfully flew for the first time as close as 30 feet in formation. In addition, the aircraft rendezvoused and flew for  more than 2.5 hours under autonomous formation control, the majority of time within 100 feet (or one wingspan) of each other. This research effort (referred to as the KQ-X project), is a follow-on to NASA's Autonomous Aerial Refueling Demonstration (AARD) project, in which manned aircraft operating on autopilot functioned as surrogate UAVs to test flight control and optical tracking systems. Work to date: The demonstration flights occurred between January and May 2012 and achieved many milestones. The lead receiver aircraft extended and retracted its aerial refueling hose several times, completing all planned tests to validate the associated program hardware and software. In addition, the trailing tanker aircraft successfully demonstrated precision control in formation with manual and automated "breakaway" maneuvers, which are important safety features and criteria of the test program. Looking ahead: Next steps involve further tests with unmanned aircraft. The team is looking for an industry partner to advance these development efforts. Partners: DARPA, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Sierra Nevada Corporation Benefits In-flight refueling: Allows UAVs to fulfill longer missions with longer flights Increased mission scope: Permits more flexibility in UAV use Long-term station keeping: Reduces the number of take-offs and landings to fulfill a given mission Automated refueling: Relieves pilots of burdensome flight refueling missions Applications UAV refueling Formation flight Automated manned aircraft refueling</p>* [Detection of Life Forms, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2bnu-d57w) - Gaia Genomics proposes to develop an instrument for the detection of earthborn and/or planetary life forms that are based on a nucleic acid paradigm.  Highly sensitive reagents will be developed to detect DNA- or RNA-based organisms.  The components of the proposed system are simple, rugged, stable, and inexpensive, and detection will be both rapid and highly sensitive.  In Phase I, we will synthesize the diagnostic reagents and demonstrate proof-of-concept by their ability to detect nucleic acids.  In Phase II, they will be incorporated into a portable prototype instrument designed for single- or multi-sample detection.  The resulting device will be ideal for use as a survey tool for NASA Astrobiology interplanetary missions (Topic S4, Sub-topic 05).* [Wideband Radio Frequency Interference Detection for Microwave Radiometer Subsystem](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gnsu-dxsb) - Anthropogenic Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) is threatening the quality and utility of multi-frequency passive microwave radiometry. The GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission launched on February 27, 2014 is already seeing RFI in the 10.7 and 18.7 GHz channels. It is important to understand that these frequency bands are strictly protected for science data measurement; yet, it is still corrupted by RFI. Indeed, this issue has led to the development of the first spaceborne digital RFI mitigation radiometer operating at 1.4 GHz for the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission. We leverage our experience on SMAP to develop innovative technology for wider-bandwidth higher-frequency radiometers.

The objective of this proposal is to develop a wideband (200-1000 MHz) digital detector subsystem and to demonstrate innovative RFI detection and removal techniques for microwave radiometers. The techniques proposed, complex valued kurtosis detector and independent component analysis (ICA), have the potential to improve the RFI detection rate in high frequency bandwidth. We are responding to a national imperative to develop RFI mitigation technology for future spaceflight radiometers. "Spectrum Management for the Twenty-first Century" recommends the continued development of so-called non-cooperative mitigation technologies. The Earth Science Technology roadmap for Advanced Microwave Components and Systems seeks “Demonstration of RFI mitigation approaches, and algorithms for future RFI environments to 40 GHz and beyond.” These two National Research Council reports emphasize the importance of RFI mitigation technology for sustaining a reliable national passive microwave remote sensing capability.* [Diagnosis-Driven Prognosis for Decision Making, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tay5-acps) - One cannot build a system-level Prognosis and Health Management (PHM) solution by cobbling together a bunch of existing prognostic techniques; it will have a very high rate of false-positive indications. On the other hand, if a system-level health management solution could identify the individual degradations and indictors associated with those degradations, and thereby decouple the problem into smaller pieces, the existing prognostic techniques could still be used to predict time to failure, and could therefore drive an effective Condition Based Maintenance and Decision Support System (CBM+).

Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI) and Vanderbilt University team seeks to develop a system-level diagnostic and prognostic process and a "sense and respond capability" which first uses error codes and discrete sensor values to correctly diagnose the system health including degradations and failures of sensors and components, and then invoke appropriate prognostic routines for assessment of remaining life and capability. Thus, QSI's Testability Engineering And Maintenance System (TEAMS) real-time reasoner will enable the use of many existing prognostics techniques in the broader context by decomposing the complex system into local datasets of degradations and associated sensor data sets, thereby limiting the problem-space for the prognostic techniques to their limited design scope. Indeed, it is well established in the contexts of parameter estimation and model-based fault identification (i.e., fault isolation and severity estimation) that feature selection and diagnosis, respectively, followed by parameter estimation provides major improvements in estimation performance (measured in terms of computational time as well as the standard deviations of the estimated parameters) when compared to full parameter estimation which provides biased estimates for all the parameters.* [Devices and Methods for Collection and Concentration of Air and Surface Samples for Improved Detection of Microbes onboard ISS, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/feqn-euex) - Protecting the International Space Station (ISS) crew from microbial contaminants is of great importance.  Bacterial and fungal contamination of air, surfaces and water aboard ISS has the potential to cause sickness among ISS crew and to impact onboard experiments.  Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments.  These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, creates a significant need for a rapid way to determine when microbial contamination events occur.  To this end, InnovaPrep LLC of Drexel, MO proposes development of improved methods for collection of microbes from air and surfaces for delivery into a small liquid volume compatible with advanced molecular based detection systems.
 Rapid microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour.  Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample collection and concentration techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in the environment.  In the proposed Phase I work, InnovaPrep will leverage current aerosol and surface collection and elution technologies and innovations from a 2015 NASA awarded SBIR for microbial concentration from ISS potable water, for handling of these technologies in a microgravity environment, to develop novel ISS aerosol and surface collection systems.  Specifically, InnovaPrep will develop new, optimized aerosol filter assemblies and surface sampling assemblies that allow for collection from larger air volumes and surface areas and elution into smaller liquid volumes than is currently possible.* [Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution](https://data.nasa.gov/d/27uc-hxhn) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI)

Currently, NASA uses different sensing technologies such as Pyrolysis&#150;GCMS to analyze planetary samples. These instruments require complex sample handling and can process only a limited number of samples.  It is critical to develop an effective instrument with extended and enhanced capabilities to enable future planetary multiple-mission needs. We propose to develop a novel nonlinear Raman spectral sensing instrument for trace organic detection at the sub ppm level based on fluoresence-free surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).  The proposed instrument will be capable of detecting the molecular signatures in Martian samples in the field with significantly improved sensitivity (>100,000,000) and reduced noise (>100).  It will offer NASA a ultra sensitive deployable instrument suitable for robotic missions in terms of in situ measurements, resolution, bandwidth, compact size, low cost, and ruggedness.  The detection of organics at the sub ppm level in Martian-like soils will be applicable to several future NASA missions, in particular future rovers for the upcoming Mars 2020 mission.   These mobile, fast and agile rovers are focused on collection for sample return and require non-sampling analytical instruments.* [Multipurpose Bottlebrush Polymers for Health Care](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uze9-qehc) - Multipurpose Bottlebrush Polymers for Health Care* [Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution](https://data.nasa.gov/d/avg2-kcf8) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI)

Additionally, an instrument suite is required to perform the complicated task of autonomous life detection. We propose to address these technological and operational requirements for ocean world access with THOR, a robust cryobot capable of rapid (10 m/hr), deep (500+ m) subglacial access that carries an onboard science payload optimized for environmental characterization and life detection. THOR will be deployed at the eastern Skaftafell subglacial lake in Vatnajokull, Iceland where it will penetrate the thick ice cover of the lake. Successful fielding of THOR will mark the first cryobot descent into a subglacial lake, thus enabling unique investigations of both the lake's geomicrobiology and of CONOPS strategies for a cryobot's entry into, and descent through, a subglacial body of water. The THOR team leverages successful work from the VALKYRIE and SPINDLE projects and offers fidelity to PSTAR in the areas of Science, Science Operations, and Technology. a) Science: Investigations of the eastern Skaftafell lake will center around detecting and characterizing microorganisms in the water column and volcanic vents to decipher the contribution of chemical energy liberated from geothermal vs. glaciological processes. To aid these investigations, THOR will carry a suite of instruments chosen to characterize the environment of the ice and subglacial lake, with a specific focus on life-detection strategies. Onboard instruments will include a fluorescence spectrometer, a holographic microscope capable of imaging prokaryotic cells, an inorganic chemistry measurement suite, a transmissometer / backscattering sensor, and a water sampler. A nanopore DNA sequencer will be used on-site to analyze water samples acquired by THOR. Comparative analysis will utilize water column and vent material samples, which will be returned to the surface and analyzed. b) Science Operations: At Skaftafell the THOR cryobot will penetrate a 300 m thick glacier and enter the subglacial lake in the volcano's crater. Upon reaching the ice-water interface, the cryobot will transition into an instrument sonde and spool itself to the lake floor while sampling and analyzing the water column. This penetrator-to-sonde strategy is a new step-wise approach to the initial exploration of an alien ocean. As the vehicle descends input from the sensor suite will govern decision-to-collect behaviors to trigger processes such as water sampling. The system will be retrieved after each mission and we anticipate completing several descents in each of two field seasons. Exploring methods which could be used to detect extant life on ocean worlds is of high importance. To that end, we will assess how well and in what ways the suite of instruments function together to determine whether life is present and at what quantities. Conventional limnological and microbiological techniques using water samples acquired by THOR will be used to evaluate autonomous sampling decisions. c) Technology: The cryobot design will use a closed-cycle hot water drill approach wherein the water is heated in a novel way: high voltage is applied across a flowing column of water, which serves as the resistive element in an electro-resistive heater. Energy transfer from the electrical source to the water is instantaneous and occurs at 100% efficiency. Direct high voltage heating, combined with new insulation technology, makes possible a compact cryobot that is capable of rapid descent and deep subglacial access with a small field-logistics footprint. Given its simplicity, the cryobot will be inexpensive, easily deployable, and field serviceable. The THOR platform will enable unprecedented access to subglacial environments, making it an ideal payload delivery system for ocean worlds technology development and analog research in this PSTAR project and beyond.* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dwtt-u9i5) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard 

total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and 

volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. 

(2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined 

using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational 

GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per 

grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional 

economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the 

range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is 

generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia 

University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and 

Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Manufacturing Advanced Channel Wall Rocket Liners, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/83a4-92eb) - Liquid rocket developers have identified advanced engine concepts that are not feasible due to manufacture due to limitations in currently available technologies. 

Specifically, engine developers are in need of a manufacturing technology that is capable of generating cooling channels in liquid rocket nozzles and combustion chambers at low cost, while supporting increasingly complex designs (see appended letter of support from Aerojet Rocketdyne).

This Phase II project will result in a reduced cost flexible technology that is ready to support the development and fabrication of advanced channel wall rocket liners and combustors.

This will be achieved by adapting a novel manufacturing technology that can machine delicate and complex features in metals and ceramics.  This technology was demonstrated to be feasible to support the advancement of channel rocket design by making more complex designs manufacturable while reducing lead time and manufacturing cost.

It was shown to reduce machine time by 90% when compared to milling the same cooling channels in stainless steel.  Advancing engine performance can be achieved through more optimal combustor and liner cooling, however engine designers are currently limited in what can be designed due to current technology slitting saw or end mill capabilities.  The proposed technology overcomes this limitation and supports the design and fabrication of highly complex and delicate features.  It can easily be scaled up to support SSME class engines.
 
At the end of Phase II, this technology will be ready to support the development of and production of channel wall rockets that incorporate more complex cooling features than are currently feasible to manufacture.  The technology will made more user friendly and efficient to implement, and a manufacturing workstation layout and cost will be developed to support both small and SSME class engines.* [Thin and Automated Blanket Lamination and Encapsulation Systems (TABLES), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yrbt-4fwf) - Flexible photovoltaic array technologies require very thin and precisely controlled deposition of the polymeric films used to fabricate them. In most flexible blanket architectures, optically transparent silicones are utilized in the fabrication of the arrays, however due to their rheology and processing conditions there are limitations to how thin they can be applied. In this proposal, Vanguard proposes Thin and Automated Blanket Lamination and Encapsulation Systems (TABLES) that utilize automated drawdown methods and rheology control to render flexible blankets approaching 700 W/kg and only 13 mils thick (including cells). Further, the TABLES concept is easily adapted to a number of substrates and superstrates, rendering "LEO to GEO" packaging and automation simply through appropriate substrate choice.* [Novel, Functionally Graded Coating System for Reusable, Very High Temperature Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v97k-iyv3) - There is a clear need to advance the state-of-the-art carbon-carbon coated Nozzle Extensions (NE) beyond the engine/mission performance currently established by Herakles technology, which is intrinsically limited to about 3000 F. The well-established SiC-based (CVD, pack cementation) technologies currently available also have upper temperature limits around 3000 F, imposing stringent limitations on increased performance and system level changes (i.e. hotter propellant) for future NASA missions. In addition, the intrinsic CTE mismatch between C-C substrate and refractory carbides/oxides further limits the use of many other classical coating technologies. The successful Phase I results established the feasibility of overcoming these limitations through the use of a novel, functionally graded (FGM) coating technology. The proposed Phase II builds on the success of the Phase I program and clearly increases its TRL by offering subscale component testing at representative engine conditions. A successful Phase II program will clearly offer a new dimension in the nozzle extensions by offering different coating systems for multi-cycle capability at temperatures from 3000 F up to 4000 F.  The expected ability of the coating to survive such an aggressive testing combined with the sufficient retention of mechanical properties offers a direct path for a Phase III with many of the commercial space payload companies. The overall approach is based upon a multi-piece C-C NE concept, which focuses the requirements for high temperature oxidation protection to smaller diameters of the nozzle extension (e.g. A cone), allowing the CVD coating technology to remain within current SOTA CVD capabilities. Larger diameter segments, which are exposed to lower temperatures, will utilize non-CVD lower cost technology which is well suited for large diameter components. The direct benefit to NASA is undisputed with direct applicability to several planned future missions, including the very challeng* [Logistics Reduction: Advanced Clothing System (ACS)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vh37-7kcv) - <p>The goal of the Advanced Exploration System (AES) Logistics Reduction&nbsp;(LR) project&#39;s Advanced Clothing System (ACS) is to use advanced commercial off-the-shelf fibers (COTS) and antimicrobial treatments to directly reduce the mass and volume of astronaut clothing. The textile industry has made significant progress with new fiber blends and garment finishing. The ACS team is leveraging existing state-of-the-art technology from private industry to make advancements in the crew wardrobe.&nbsp; There is not a clear measure of how the newer fibers contribute to longer wear in a microgravity shirt sleeve environment.&nbsp; The ACS provides a means of comparing varying fabrics through a series of controlled conditions.</p><p>The current clothing state-of-the-art on the International Space Station (ISS) is disposable, mostly cotton-based, clothing with no laundry provisions. Each clothing article has varying use&nbsp;periods and will become trash. The goal is to increase the length of wear of the clothing to reduce the logistical mass and volume.</p><p>The ACS technology is a continuation from the Logistics Reduction and Repurposing project. The initial focus was exercise clothing and routine wear tops since the use period is shorter. A ground-based experiment was conducted to evaluate current and lighter weight COTS&nbsp;exercise clothing and antimicrobial treatments to investigate if they could be used for longer periods of time. The best performers were selected for an&nbsp;experiment on the International Space Station (ISS) - Intravehicular Activity (IVA) Clothing Study. The experiment was conducted during ISS increments 39 through 41 with six crew&nbsp;members. A laundry trade-off study was conducted to quantify how longer-wear clothing changes the break-even point for laundering vs. clothing disposal. The analysis indicates that use of ACS selected garments (e.g. wool, modacrylic, polyester) can increase the breakeven point for laundry to about 300 days. ACS studies also investigated lint reduction and microbial behavior on textiles.&nbsp; The ACS task also investigated&nbsp;the subtasks of alternative laundry and clothing sanitation technologies in FY16 and FY17.&nbsp; In FY18, internal NASA technology testing will allow down select of technologies that will then notionally begin development in FY19 in parallel with new SBIR/STTR requests in key areas.</p><p>Several SBIR companies have investigated coatings to improve wear and laundering of clothing over the ACS time period.</p>* [Fault Adaptive Control of Overactuated Systems Using Prognostic Estimation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mq9r-yg32) - Most fault adaptive control research addresses the preservation of system stability or functionality in the presence of a specific failure (fault). This paper examines the fault adaptive control problem for a generic class of incipient failure modes, which do not initially affect system stability, but will eventually cause a catastrophic failure to occur. This risk of catastrophic failure due a component fault mode is some monotonically increasing function of the load on the component. Assuming that a probabilistic prognostic model is available to evaluate the risk of incipient fault modes growing into catastrophic failure conditions, then fundamentally the fault adaptive control problem is to adjust component
loads to minimize risk of failure, while not overly degrading nominal performance. A methodology is proposed for posing this problem as a finite horizon constrained optimization, where constraints correspond to maximum risk of failure and maximum deviation from nominal performance. Development of the methodology to handle a general class of overactuated systems is given. Also, the fault adaptive control methodology is demonstrated on an application example of practical significance, an electro-mechanical actuator (EMA) consisting of three DC motors geared to the same output shaft. Similar actuator systems are commonly used in aerospace, transportation, and industrial processes to actuate critical loads, such as aircraft control surfaces. The fault mode simulated in the system is a temperature dependent motor winding insulation degradation.* [Prognostic Health-Management System Development for Electromechanical Actuators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7prv-6yvh) - Electro-mechanical actuators (EMAs) have been gaining increased acceptance as safety-critical actuation devices in the next generation of aircraft and spacecraft.  The aerospace manufacturers are not ready, however, to completely embrace EMAs for all applications due to apprehension with regard to some of the more critical fault modes.  This work aims to help address these concerns by developing and testing a prognostic health management system that diagnoses EMA faults and employs prognostic algorithms to track fault progression and predict the actuator remaining useful life. The diagnostic algorithm is implemented using a combined model-based and data-driven reasoner. The prognostic algorithm, implemented using Gaussian Process Regression, estimates the remaining life of the faulted component. The paper also covers the selection of fault modes for coverage and methods developed for fault injection. Validation experiments were conducted both in laboratory and flight conditions using the Flyable Electromechanical Actuator (FLEA) test stand. The FLEA allows test actuators to be subjected to realistic environmental and operating conditions, while providing the capability to safely inject and monitor propagation of various fault modes. The paper covers both diagnostic and prognostic, run-to-failure experiments, conducted in laboratory and flight conditions for several types of faults. The experiments demonstrated robust fault diagnosis on the selected set of component and sensor faults and high-accuracy predictions of failure time in prognostic scenarios.* [Developing, Maintaining, and Restoring Team Cohesion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uhe2-dj9w) - Team cohesion, as an important team process factor, has been researched in the psychological literature for well over 50 years. Several meta-analytic investigations have firmly established its contribution to team effectiveness (Beal, Cohen, Burke, & McLendon, 2003; Gully, Devine, & Whitney, 1995; Mullen & Copper, 1994), particularly for teams performing complex, interdependent tasks. Team cohesion is primarily viewed as a motivational team process that captures the interpersonal attraction of team members to each other (social cohesion) and the commitment of members to the team mission (task cohesion). Although task cohesion is more strongly related to team performance, both factors are important because problems with social cohesion can “spill over” to undermine task cohesion, other relevant team processes, and team performance (Kozlowski & Ilgen, 2006). Thus, the capability to intervene to enhance the development, maintenance, and restoration of team cohesion for flight crews and ground control teams is essential to the overall mission effectiveness for the NASA strategic plan for space exploration (NASA, 2008).     <p></p>
Team cohesion, good collaboration, and psychosocial health are essential ingredients for effective “high reliability” action teams that perform critical tasks in isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environments, such as teams of astronauts. Although a substantial amount of research has established a relationship between team cohesion and team effectiveness, very little research examines how teams collaborate and maintain cohesion, effective teamwork, and psychosocial health over time. That is, the vast majority of the research is based on static, cross-sectional data. There is simply very little research examining team cohesion and team functioning over short, medium, and long duration missions. Thus, basic research to examine team interaction dynamics is needed to develop effective and obtrusive assessment methods, monitoring technologies, and team regulation tools and techniques to enable crew members and mission controllers to maintain, sustain, and adapt team collaboration to achieve team effectiveness. That is the focus of this research effort.    <p></p>
This ground-based research focused on three primary areas of activity:    <p></p>
1.	We worked to gain access to NASA analog environments with the goal of benchmarking team cohesion variability and fluctuations for teams operating under ICE conditions.     <p></p>
•	Establishing normative benchmarks for team interaction and function is critical to (later) being able to detect anomalies that necessitate countermeasures.      <p></p>
2.	We developed and prototyped a technology platform (i.e., a wireless sensor system) to provide an unobtrusive measurement system for monitoring team interactions and assessing psychosocial health.     <p></p>
•	Real time cohesion and collaboration assessment will be critical to monitoring team effectiveness and triggering countermeasures.    <p></p>
3.	We prototyped the use of behavioral metrics to assess team cohesion, which is a critical first step for establishing the utility of the monitoring technology, and initiated a phased validation process to demonstrate the potential of the monitoring technology and measurement system.     <p></p>
•	It is essential that the technology system provides reliable, valid, and useful metrics for assessing the nature and quality of team interactions. <p></p>* [Propulsion Health Monitoring of a Turbine Engine Disk using Spin Test Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9cg3-upqa) - On line detection techniques to monitor the health of rotating engine components are becoming increasingly attractive options to aircraft engine companies in order to increase safety of operation and lower maintenance costs. Health monitoring remains a challenging feature to easily implement, especially, in the presence of scattered loading conditions, crack size, component geometry and materials properties. The current trend, however, is to utilize noninvasive types of health monitoring or nondestructive techniques to detect hidden flaws and mini cracks before any catastrophic event occurs. These techniques go further to evaluate materials' discontinuities and other anomalies that have grown to the level of critical defects which can lead to failure. Generally, health monitoring is highly dependent on sensor systems that are capable of performing in various engine environmental conditions and able to transmit a signal upon a predetermined crack length, while acting in a neutral form upon the overall performance of the engine system. Efforts are under way at NASA Glenn Research Center through support of the Intelligent Vehicle Health Management Project (IVHM) to develop and implement such sensor technology for a wide variety of applications [1-5]. These efforts are focused on developing high temperature, wireless, low cost and durable products.Therefore, in an effort to address the technical issues concerning health monitoring of a rotor disk, this paper considers data collected from an experimental study using high frequency capacitive sensor technology to capture blade tip clearance and tip timing measurements in a rotating engine-like-disk-to predict the disk faults and assess its structural integrity. The experimental results collected at a range of rotational speeds from tests conducted at the NASA Glenn Research Center's Rotordynamics Laboratory will be evaluated using multiple data-driven anomaly detection techniques [6-9] to identify anomalies in the disk. This study is expected to present a select evaluation of online health monitoring of a rotating disk using these high caliber sensors and test the capability of the in-house spin system.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Climate and Land Cover](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w2sg-brem) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Climate and Land Cover provides data and information on global gridded climatological variables, global land cover maps, and national and international protected areas. The climatological data include the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) monthly terrestrial surface temperature and precipitation grids at 0.5 degree resolution from 1901-1996, along with temperature and precipitation grids at 10-minute resolution from the CRU and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). The Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000) was produced by an international partnership of 30 research groups coordinated by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which contained two levels of land cover information; detailed and regionally optimized land cover for each continent, and a less thematically detailed global land cover that harmonizes regions into one consistent product. The maps were based on daily data from the Vegetation 1 sensor on-board SPOT 4, though mapping of regions required the use of data from additional Earth observing sensors to resolve specific issues. The international and national protected areas were generated from the World Database of Protected Areas for the year 2000.* [Space Weather in Operation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/usry-vycb) - <p>The &ldquo;Space Weather in Operations&rdquo; effort will provide on-demand and near-real time space weather event information to the Data Access Toolkit (DAT), which is the next generation trending system for NASA missions.&nbsp; The types of space weather events that will be identified and made available in the system include solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and solar energetic particles.</p><p>It is imperative that Mission Operations Teams (MOTs) have access to information that is pertinent to the safety of their satellites.&nbsp; Space environment information, particularly phenomena that is elevated to the level of &quot;event&quot; status, is information that should be readily available to all MOTs - allowing them to be better equipped to protect NASA assets in space.</p> <p>This activity will leverage existing GSFC capabilities and data sets, with space weather event information primarily coming from the Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) system.&nbsp; DONKI currently captures all space weather events that are observed and analyzed by the forecasters at the Space Weather Research Center (SWRC) at GSFC.&nbsp; Once a standardized interface and pipeline has been clearly defined and implemented, the DAT trending system can request and ingest SW event information from DONKI in near real-time - subsequently making such information readily available to the MOT.&nbsp; The DONKI system would also be able to request and ingest potential spacecraft anomaly events, or general spacecraft events of interest, from the DAT trending system.&nbsp; These spacecraft events would help the CCMC/SWRC team correlate and investigate the effects of space weather on various spacecraft under specific circumstances.</p>* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios](https://data.nasa.gov/d/43y3-n5qx) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios provide useful insight into the complex factors that drive ecosystem change, estimating the magnitude   of regional pressures on ecosystems and critical uncertainties that could undermine sustainable development. They also provide an understanding of the importance of institutions and values   as the long-range outlook for the world's ecosystems depends on the course taken by global and regional development in the coming decades. The integration of changing ecosystem conditions   into the global scenarios was taken as both effects and causes. The MA scenarios include those for population, income, cereal production and consumption, meat production and consumption,   land cover, waster stress, water availability, acidification and nitrogen deposition.* [AutoNav Mark 4: Autonomous Navigation Software, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/km9m-7fb8) - The growing number of missions in deep space, from Discovery class missions like Psyche and Lucy down to very small spacecraft like Lunar Flashlight, is driving the need for standardized, flexible, full-featured flight software for spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control (GNC). Autonomous GNC allows a spacecraft to perform most of its own navigation activities without the need for ground-based personnel and DSN time, reducing cost and required DSN contact time, saving money, and allowing specialized navigation personnel from different NASA centers to be easily shared among missions.

Autonomous GNC activities include:
  -spacecraft positioning
    absolute and relative (helio, planet, small-body)
    relative to small bodies, other spacecraft for rendezvous
  -orbit determination
  -target tracking of bodies, apertures, spacecraft, ground-based assets
  -trajectory derivation
  -low-thrust maneuvering for Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP)
  -ephemeris calculations

AutoNav from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory implements these functions, and components have flown on Deep Space 1 and Deep Impact. With an appropriate application of software development process to reengineer the code, a new AutoNav Mark 4 could be made available as a commercialized product meeting NASA Class B software standards, thereby enabling its easy inclusion on a wide variety of NASA and non-NASA missions.

AutoNav Mark 4 source code is designed and tested to be compatible with a variety of different CPUs (e.g. SPARC, PPC, Intel), real-time operating systems (VxWorks, RTEMS), and flight software cores like NASA Core Flight System. This approach allows AN4 to be deployed in the widest-possible set of environments:
  -within STRS-compatible space radios (e.g. Iris)
  -in the flight software load of the spacecraft C&DH
  -in a dedicated stand-alone instrument like the Deep Space Positioning System

AutoNav Mark 4 provides highly capable autonomous GNC while saving missions money.* [Follow-On Shaft Seal Evaluation for Future OMS Engine Series Valve Derivations](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xz62-uvh8) - <p>The objective of this project is to characterize/determine the conditions under which propellant vapor migrates/permeates past the Orbital Maneuvering Subsystem Engine (OMS-E) series valve ball valve pinion shaft seals into the series valve actuators.  Initial testing was performed in fiscal year (FY) 2012 and continued in FY 2013.<p/><p>Evidence of nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and monomethylhydrazine (MMH) propellant vapor leakage across the primary and secondary shafts seals of the four OMS-E series valve ball valve pinions have been found on nearly all OMS engines processed at the NASA White Sands Test Facility since 1996. This leakage results in various forms of internal damage to series valve ball valve pinions and actuator assembly components.  Two in-flight anomalies occurred during Shuttle flight history (STS-91 OMS-E serial number [S/N] 107; and STS-101 on OMS-E S/N 111) that were direct results of propellant vapor leakage. Testing was performed in FY 2012 and 2013 to attempt to characterize/determine the conditions under which the vapors migrate/permeate past the redundant (primary and secondary) shafts seals on the ball valve pinions and into the actuator housings.  In FY 2012 a "simple soak" test was performed in which NTO and MMH were introduced into their respective cavities in a flight series valve and vapor break-through monitored downstream of the primary and secondary shaft seals of each of the four ball valves using vapor detection devices.  The follow-on testing performed in FY 2013 focuses on the MMH part of the series valve.  In this test, MMH is introduced into the cavity between the fuel ball valves, the cavity pressurized to 250 pounds per square inch gage (psig), and monitoring performed downstream of the primary and secondary shaft seals using vapor detection devices. FY 2012 soak tests resulted in evidence of NTO vapor permeation past the primary and secondary shaft seals of the oxidizer ball valves in 2.5 and 18.5 hours respectively.  While MMH vapor permeation was measured at the primary shaft seal locations of the fuel ball valves in 1.5 hours, no evidence of permeation past the secondary shaft seal was measured after 6 weeks of data logging.  This resulted in the follow-on test in FY 2013 to add pressurization of the fuel ball valve cavity to determine if this would result in MMH vapor measurements downstream of the fuel ball valve secondary shaft seal locations.  FY 2013 testing will be completed by September 2013 and results compiled in a test report.</p>* [Global Cyclone Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qr4m-czu6) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI) Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation (WASP). Utilizing average monthly precipitation data from 1980 through 2000 at a resolution of 2.5 degrees, WASP assesses the precipitation deficit or surplus over a three month temporal window that is weighted by the magnitude of the seasonal cyclic variation in precipitation. The three months' averages are derived from the precipitation data and the median rainfall for the 21 year period is calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells where the three month running average of precipitation is less than 1 mm per day ae excluded. Drought events are identified when the magnitude of a monthly precipitation deficit is less than or equal to 50 percent of its longterm median value for three or more consecutive months. Grid cells are then divided into 10 classes having an approximately equal number of grid cells. Higher grid cell values denote higher frequencies of drought occurrences. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Development of Optics and Detectors for Advanced CMB Polarization Measurements](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2w4g-93cf) - Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have been essential to the development of modern cosmology. Future observations will provide cosmological constraints from structure formation as well as improved characterization of inflation in the early universe.  Starting in 2008, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) measured the CMB temperature on arcminute scales, discovered galaxy clusters through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and when combined with measurements from NASA's WMAP satellite provided evidence for the existence of dark energy for the first time using CMB measurements alone.  With this NSTRF fellowship I plan to work towards the development of optics and detector technologies for a next generation instrument to be deployed on ACT. ACT is a six-meter telescope located in the Atacama Desert in Chile at an elevation of 5190 m. A polarization sensitive upgrade to ACT, known as ACTPol, is now beginning observations. Throughout the length of the fellowship, we will work to implement and observe with ACTPol. We will be able to study the growth of cosmic structure in our universe via detections of galaxy clusters and gravitational lensing of the CMB and will improve constraints on cosmological parameters that describe the early universe.

With the use of approximately 3,000 superconducting detectors operating at 90 GHz and 150 GHz, ACTPol will enable high precision measurements of the polarization of the CMB.  One of my goals during the fellowship is to help develop a future upgrade to ACT that will provide wider frequency coverage with many more detectors. An important aspect of this project will be research into reading out larger superconducting detector arrays, which could impact technologies for future NASA space missions, such as a next generation X-ray observatory or the Inflation Probe.  This as well as research on silicon optics will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. The optics research is relevant to measurements over a wide range of wavelengths, from far infrared to millimeter wave, and could be used on future NASA missions at these wavelengths. The research conducted under this fellowship will contribute towards improving the technology readiness levels of all the associated technologies for use in future NASA missions.* [TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) Level 1 Raw and Calibrated Radiance Products (TRMM Product 1A11) V7](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tmvk-xx27) - The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation and to estimate its associated latent heating. TRMM was successfully launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.

The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a nine-channel passive microwave radiometer, which builds on the heritage of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument flown aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. Microwave radiation is emitted by the Earth's surface and by water droplets within clouds. However, when layers of large ice particles are present in upper cloud regions - a condition highly correlated with heavy rainfall - microwave radiation tends to scatter at frequencies above 19 GHz. The TMI detects radiation at five frequencies chosen to discriminate among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood of rainfall. The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by this method is the deduction of cloud precipitation consistent with the radiation measurement at each frequency. The TMI frequencies are 10.65, 19.35, 37 and 85.5 GHz (dual polarization), and 21 GHz (vertical polarization only).

The Level 1A product file (1A11) is a concatenation of the Level 0 data with a header record and, as such, is reversible to Level 0. The header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbit number, times of the first scan and number of scans, among other things. The Level 0 data contain the actual channel data expressed as "sensor counts." A file contains data for a single orbit with a file size of about 7 MB (uncompressed).  There are 16 files of TMI 1A11 data produced per day.

Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.

TRMM V6 vs. V7 Major Data Format Changes: http://pps.gsfc.nasa.gov/Documents/formatChangesV7.pdf* [Microplate Heat Exchanger, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3s2i-wrb4) - We propose a microplate heat exchanger for cryogenic cooling systems used for continuous flow distributed cooling systems, large focal plane arrays, multiple cooling locations, and very low vibration cooling systems. Any DC cryogenic flow system such as turbo Brayton, Joule-Thomson (JT), or remote cooling applications require very high effectiveness heat exchangers to reduce input power. The parasitic loads from heat exchangers are a significant fraction of the overall load, and high effectiveness heat exchangers lead directly to improved system efficiencies across a broad range of cryogenic applications.

Microplate heat exchangers have a demonstrated effectiveness over 98% (Marquardt, Cryocoolers 15). While performance is high, they will be difficult to use for larger cryogenic flow systems due to parasitic conduction losses inherent in the materials available for the manufacturing process. A material change will allow more compact heat exchangers with lower parasitic losses. Other limitations of the manufacturing process make yields low, and while it may be possible to push the effectiveness higher, it may be difficult to consistently produce high performing exchangers using the current approach.

We propose a new bi-metal microplate heat exchanger which is unique in that it uses the manufacturing process to control critical heat exchanger dimensions that are inherently similar across all parts, allowing high effectiveness without the need for close inspection of every part and the low yield which results from hand inspection. We further include additional features within the flow channels that automatically balance the mass flows within the heat exchanger to push the effectiveness even higher. This is accomplished in the most compact cryogenic heat exchangers theoretically possible to build using parallel plate flow channels.* [Hydrocarbon Leak Detection Sensor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wptu-32qn) - FTT is proposing the development of a sensor to detect the presence of hydrocarbons in turbopump Inter-Propellant Seals (IPS).  The purpose of the IPS is to prevent the fuel (RP-2) and oxidizer (LOX) from mixing by using an inert purge gas; however, a major risk of the IPS is RP-2 wicking into the buffer or LOX cavities, threatening ignition with the LOX.  The proposed sensor will detect the presence of hydrocarbons and signal the health management system to safely shutdown.  It will increase the reliability of the IPS, and decrease turnaround time between missions by eliminating the need for manual inspections for hydrocarbons in the IPS.
	There are two main technical objectives for Phase I.  First is to research and test various hydrocarbon indicators to determine which materials can detect the presence of hydrocarbons by either changing color or intensity.  The second objective is to research and test various optical viewing devices and data processing devices to determine which mechanism can adequately capture the color or intensity change of the hydrocarbon indicator and signal that the change has occurred.  The sensor will be comprised of the feasible components determined during Phase I, and tested in a rig in Phase II.* [Sealing Technologies for Repetitive Use in Abrasive, Electrostatic, High Vacuum Environments, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4vba-8yjj) - Clearly, the presence of lunar dust has the propensity for major adverse impacts on dynamic mechanical systems required for future lunar operations such as Rovers, Robotic Systems, In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) and science experiments. As such, the development of innovative techniques for mitigating dust affects is warranted. In abrasive environments such as the presence of regolith dust on the moon, mechanism seals must be either designed for robustness to avoid premature damage and leakage, or, the dust particles must be removed. For this SBIR, Starsys proposes an enabling all-metal, knife-edge seal capable of maintaining seal integrity even in the presence of the abrasive, lunar dust. The proposed Knife Edge Seal concept provides for an innovative mechanism by which to seal critical ISRU mechanisms even in the presence of lunar dust contamination. Starsys' knife edge seal approach will utilize a hard metal knife edge and seal gland filled with an Indium alloy. The knife edge geometry is sized to allow for low forces required to penetrate the Indium, while the gland geometry is sized to properly and reliably capture the Indium. The Indium is a phase change material available in a variety of alloys to target specific melting points. 

The Knife Edge Seal offers two distinct advantages when attempting to mitigate the affects of lunar dust; 1) the knife edge will penetrate any dust layer developed on the seal gland surface and embed itself into the gland material, and 2) the Indium can be heated and re-flowed in between mate and de-mate cycles, allowing the dust particles to mix in with the soft Indium material and most likely eliminating sufficient barrier between the knife edge and Indium to allow for sufficient sealing to occur.* [Rapid Concentration for Improved Detection of Microbes in ISS Potable Water, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bked-xvzq) - Providing a reliable supply of safe drinking water is a critical requirement for space exploration. Systems that provide recycled treated water aboard the International Space Station, and that will supply water aboard future spacecraft, are inherently complex and can be susceptible to biofilm formation and microbial contamination. Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments. These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, make rapid, reliable methods of detecting microbes at low levels a critical need. Rapid microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour. Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample concentration and preparation techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in drinking water. Currently, without sample concentration, rapid detection techniques alone produce results that are hundreds to thousands of times less sensitive than the minimum desired detection limit for microbial water contaminants. InnovaPrep proposes development of a rapid microbial concentration system designed for use aboard the International Space Station. The system will concentrate microbes from up to 5 Liters of potable water into volumes as small as 200 uL, providing concentration factors as high as 15,000X. It will be based on technologies developed and commercialized by InnovaPrep, but will contain innovations to allow for operation in microgravity. Large volumes of potable water are processed through a hollow fiber membrane filter concentration cell as microbes are captured within the lumen of the fibers. Following capture, the microbes are efficiently eluted using a novel Wet Foam Elution process and then delivered to a rapid detection system for analysis.* [Structural Health Monitoring with Fiber Bragg Grating and Piezo Arrays, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kkxz-fuu2) - IFOS and its research institute collaborator, Washington State University (WSU), have demonstrated feasibility of a structural health monitoring (SHM) system for aerospace vehicles such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or commercial airliners. In Phase 1, a unique high-speed, high-channel count fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor interrogation system enabling a new Lamb wave-based damage detection method was demonstrated. This SHM system allows accurate detection of damage in rectangular composite plates simultaneously collected from a plurality of strategically placed FBG sensors using  relatively few piezo actuators. Utilization of structurally integrated, distributed sensors to monitor the health of a structure allows for high-speed collection and interpretation of sensor signals, coupled with real-time data processing. The proposed system provides automated diagnosis and prognosis capabilities, greatly reducing the overall inspection burden. Phase 2 is designed to advance the technology towards specific NASA flight research testbed platforms, particularly Ikhana. During Phase 2, IFOS will collaborate with prime system contractors to address challenges and risks associated with the intended operational environment, including (a) generation of a complete flight worthy design, (b) performance enhancement and ruggedization of the interrogator and sensors, (c) optimization of damage detection algorithms and their implementation, and (d) total system performance validation and evaluation.* [Probabilistic Delamination Diagnosis of Composite Materials Using a Novel Bayesian Imaging Method](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nztd-2nue) - In this paper, a probabilistic delamination location and size detection framework is proposed. The delamination probability image using Lamb wave-based damage detection is constructed using the Bayesian updating technique. First, the algorithm for the probabilistic delamination detection framework using Bayesian updating (Bayesian Imaging Method - BIM) is proposed. Following this, the composite coupon fatigue testing setup is introduced and the corresponding lamb wave diagnosis signal is collected and interpreted. Next, the obtained signal features are incorporated in the Bayesian Imaging Method to detect delamination size and location, as well as their confidence bounds. The damage detection results using the proposed methodology are compared with X-ray images for verification and validation. Finally, some conclusions and future works are drawn based on the proposed study.* [THOR (Thermal High-voltage Ocean-penetrator Research platform)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/du5d-cx3p) - Robotic exploration and life search on ocean worlds requires the ability to access habitable ocean environments concealed beneath thick ice crusts. Additionally, an instrument suite is required to perform the complicated task of autonomous life detection. We propose to address these technological and operational requirements for ocean world access with THOR, a robust cryobot capable of rapid (10 m/hr), deep (500+ m) subglacial access that carries an onboard science payload optimized for environmental characterization and life detection. THOR will be deployed at the eastern Skaftafell subglacial lake in Vatnajokull, Iceland where it will penetrate the thick ice cover of the lake. Successful fielding of THOR will mark the first cryobot descent into a subglacial lake, thus enabling unique investigations of both the lake's geomicrobiology and of CONOPS strategies for a cryobot's entry into, and descent through, a subglacial body of water. The THOR team leverages successful work from the VALKYRIE and SPINDLE projects and offers fidelity to PSTAR in the areas of Science, Science Operations, and Technology. a) Science: Investigations of the eastern Skaftafell lake will center around detecting and characterizing microorganisms in the water column and volcanic vents to decipher the contribution of chemical energy liberated from geothermal vs. glaciological processes. To aid these investigations, THOR will carry a suite of instruments chosen to characterize the environment of the ice and subglacial lake, with a specific focus on life-detection strategies. Onboard instruments will include a fluorescence spectrometer, a holographic microscope capable of imaging prokaryotic cells, an inorganic chemistry measurement suite, a transmissometer / backscattering sensor, and a water sampler. A nanopore DNA sequencer will be used on-site to analyze water samples acquired by THOR. Comparative analysis will utilize water column and vent material samples, which will be returned to the surface and analyzed. b) Science Operations: At Skaftafell the THOR cryobot will penetrate a 300 m thick glacier and enter the subglacial lake in the volcano's crater. Upon reaching the ice-water interface, the cryobot will transition into an instrument sonde and spool itself to the lake floor while sampling and analyzing the water column. This penetrator-to-sonde strategy is a new step-wise approach to the initial exploration of an alien ocean. As the vehicle descends input from the sensor suite will govern decision-to-collect behaviors to trigger processes such as water sampling. The system will be retrieved after each mission and we anticipate completing several descents in each of two field seasons. Exploring methods which could be used to detect extant life on ocean worlds is of high importance. To that end, we will assess how well and in what ways the suite of instruments function together to determine whether life is present and at what quantities. Conventional limnological and microbiological techniques using water samples acquired by THOR will be used to evaluate autonomous sampling decisions. c) Technology: The cryobot design will use a closed-cycle hot water drill approach wherein the water is heated in a novel way: high voltage is applied across a flowing column of water, which serves as the resistive element in an electro-resistive heater. Energy transfer from the electrical source to the water is instantaneous and occurs at 100% efficiency. Direct high voltage heating, combined with new insulation technology, makes possible a compact cryobot that is capable of rapid descent and deep subglacial access with a small field-logistics footprint. Given its simplicity, the cryobot will be inexpensive, easily deployable, and field serviceable. The THOR platform will enable unprecedented access to subglacial environments, making it an ideal payload delivery system for ocean worlds technology development and analog research in this PSTAR project and beyond.* [MINERVA: Using Small, Fully Robotic Telescopes to Search for Habitable-Zone Exoplanets](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i6b6-kerz) - The 2010 Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics declared that a program to identify nearby, terrestrial planets with the possibility for liquid water and oxygen in the atmosphere is of top priority. Finding these planets poses significant technical challenges. Firstly, nearly all current instruments lack the sensitivity to detect habitable-zone planets with masses less than five times that of Earth’s. Secondly, a planet’s radius and mass, and thus its density and internal composition, can only be estimated through the combined data from both transit and radial velocity measurements. Thirdly and most considerably, definitive detection of such planets requires the observations of many orbits in order to obtain a time-averaged signal. This level of cadence is unfeasible in the existing framework of shared telescope time, and currently there are few observatories dedicated to exoplanet science.

The Minerva project will address these limitations by building a ground-based telescope array, capable of both transit science and radial velocimetry, dedicated to the detection of terrestrial planets around nearby stars. Four 0.7-meter telescopes will each be equipped with an imaging camera and will fiber-feed to a single high-resolution spectrometer. The multi-telescope model affords Minerva the flexibility to observe in formation, with a synthesized aperture of 1.4m, or take simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric measurements.

Perhaps the most unique feature of Minerva will be its availability to search for planets every single clear night. To accomplish this, the observatory will be fully robotic; all components of the telescope array and instrument suite will need to operate autonomously. The Minerva software will control multiple telescopes and a number of instruments simultaneously, requiring precise synchronization and complex data handling. The system must be robust and efficient in recovering from any errors encountered. My task is to lead the design of the Minerva software, thereby solving the problem of how to efficiently and robustly manage a complex distributed-aperture robotic observatory with an extensive instrument suite. I plan to base the software architecture on the modular and highly efficient model developed for Robo-AO, a successfully operating fully robotic adaptive optics system. I have personally developed routines for Robo-AO and hope to adapt the system to meet Minerva’s unique requirements.

Minerva will directly address a multitude of technical challenges put forth by NASA’s Space Technology Roadmaps. Firstly, the distributed-aperture model is immediately matched to TA8.2.3: Distributed Aperture Observatories. Secondly, the complex robotic system will necessarily advance technologies in the field of autonomy, specifically the following areas:  TA4.5.4: Multi-Agent Coordination, TA4.5.2: Dynamic Planning and Sequencing Tools, and finally TA4.5.3: Autonomous Guidance and Control.* [Propulsion Health Monitoring of a Turbine Engine Disk using Spin Test Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9cg3-upqa) - On line detection techniques to monitor the health of rotating engine components are becoming increasingly attractive options to aircraft engine companies in order to increase safety of operation and lower maintenance costs. Health monitoring remains a challenging feature to easily implement, especially, in the presence of scattered loading conditions, crack size, component geometry and materials properties. The current trend, however, is to utilize noninvasive types of health monitoring or nondestructive techniques to detect hidden flaws and mini cracks before any catastrophic event occurs. These techniques go further to evaluate materials' discontinuities and other anomalies that have grown to the level of critical defects which can lead to failure. Generally, health monitoring is highly dependent on sensor systems that are capable of performing in various engine environmental conditions and able to transmit a signal upon a predetermined crack length, while acting in a neutral form upon the overall performance of the engine system. Efforts are under way at NASA Glenn Research Center through support of the Intelligent Vehicle Health Management Project (IVHM) to develop and implement such sensor technology for a wide variety of applications [1-5]. These efforts are focused on developing high temperature, wireless, low cost and durable products.Therefore, in an effort to address the technical issues concerning health monitoring of a rotor disk, this paper considers data collected from an experimental study using high frequency capacitive sensor technology to capture blade tip clearance and tip timing measurements in a rotating engine-like-disk-to predict the disk faults and assess its structural integrity. The experimental results collected at a range of rotational speeds from tests conducted at the NASA Glenn Research Center's Rotordynamics Laboratory will be evaluated using multiple data-driven anomaly detection techniques [6-9] to identify anomalies in the disk. This study is expected to present a select evaluation of online health monitoring of a rotating disk using these high caliber sensors and test the capability of the in-house spin system.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Climate and Land Cover](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w2sg-brem) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Climate and Land Cover provides data and information on global gridded climatological variables, global land cover maps, and national and international protected areas. The climatological data include the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) monthly terrestrial surface temperature and precipitation grids at 0.5 degree resolution from 1901-1996, along with temperature and precipitation grids at 10-minute resolution from the CRU and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). The Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000) was produced by an international partnership of 30 research groups coordinated by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which contained two levels of land cover information; detailed and regionally optimized land cover for each continent, and a less thematically detailed global land cover that harmonizes regions into one consistent product. The maps were based on daily data from the Vegetation 1 sensor on-board SPOT 4, though mapping of regions required the use of data from additional Earth observing sensors to resolve specific issues. The international and national protected areas were generated from the World Database of Protected Areas for the year 2000.* [Space Weather in Operation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/usry-vycb) - <p>The &ldquo;Space Weather in Operations&rdquo; effort will provide on-demand and near-real time space weather event information to the Data Access Toolkit (DAT), which is the next generation trending system for NASA missions.&nbsp; The types of space weather events that will be identified and made available in the system include solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and solar energetic particles.</p><p>It is imperative that Mission Operations Teams (MOTs) have access to information that is pertinent to the safety of their satellites.&nbsp; Space environment information, particularly phenomena that is elevated to the level of &quot;event&quot; status, is information that should be readily available to all MOTs - allowing them to be better equipped to protect NASA assets in space.</p> <p>This activity will leverage existing GSFC capabilities and data sets, with space weather event information primarily coming from the Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) system.&nbsp; DONKI currently captures all space weather events that are observed and analyzed by the forecasters at the Space Weather Research Center (SWRC) at GSFC.&nbsp; Once a standardized interface and pipeline has been clearly defined and implemented, the DAT trending system can request and ingest SW event information from DONKI in near real-time - subsequently making such information readily available to the MOT.&nbsp; The DONKI system would also be able to request and ingest potential spacecraft anomaly events, or general spacecraft events of interest, from the DAT trending system.&nbsp; These spacecraft events would help the CCMC/SWRC team correlate and investigate the effects of space weather on various spacecraft under specific circumstances.</p>* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios](https://data.nasa.gov/d/43y3-n5qx) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios provide useful insight into the complex factors that drive ecosystem change, estimating the magnitude   of regional pressures on ecosystems and critical uncertainties that could undermine sustainable development. They also provide an understanding of the importance of institutions and values   as the long-range outlook for the world's ecosystems depends on the course taken by global and regional development in the coming decades. The integration of changing ecosystem conditions   into the global scenarios was taken as both effects and causes. The MA scenarios include those for population, income, cereal production and consumption, meat production and consumption,   land cover, waster stress, water availability, acidification and nitrogen deposition.* [SpaceDoc-Intelligent Health Management System for Astronauts, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7e7b-q98g) - Crew health and performance are critical to successful space explorations. However, long duration missions present numerous risks to crew health and performance. Human exploration missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO) will present additional challenges. These missions will require technology solutions for crew health care to address physiological, psychological, performance, and other needs in-situ, e.g., self-sufficiency, since real-time medical support from the earth, and emergency evacuation will not be available. Onboard personal health-tracking tools for health monitoring, health risk assessment and management will be needed for the crews in order to predict his/her future health conditions. Therefore, missions beyond LEO will require a new generation of capabilities and systems, which will be built upon existing capabilities and incorporate technologies yet to be developed. Lynntech proposes image-based photoplethysmography, in combination with, smart machine-learning algorithms which will primarily utilize onboard high-quality video cameras. The proposed system will: (1) constantly monitor vital physiological signs data, (2) ensure their acceptability,  (3) identify their unusual or abnormal patterns, (4) perform diagnosis and prognosis, as well as, (5) provide necessary risk mitigation and medical intervention options to maintain crew performance optimal and sustained throughout the mission.* [Vibration reduction methods and techniques for rotorcraft utilizing on-blade active control, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c426-qp8p) - Rotor blades adapted for vibration control have the added benefit of extended blade and rotor life, as well as improved passenger comfort.  Approaches that have been explored for on-blade active control or individual blade control include control surface actuation, such as trailing edge flaps, and integrated blade manipulation, such as controllable twist.  For retro-fit and upgrade purposes, the advanced rotor system needs an actuation scheme with appropriate force, deflection, and bandwidth, without detrimentally increasing on-blade mass.  Research in this area has been conducted with potential solutions employing various conventional active material actuator configurations, but these systems have typically suffered from inherent disadvantages.  Due to these limitations, Techno-Sciences, Inc. proposes the use of pneumatic artificial muscles to actuate a trailing edge flap device for management of rotorcraft vibration.  The proposed actuators are constructed of passive materials that are very mass efficient and low cost, while maintaining adequate force, stroke, and bandwidth.  Oriented along the blade span and located within the airfoil contour near the blade root, the antagonistic configuration of actuators offers bi-directional flap deflection and operation under a low centrifugal field.  A lightweight mechanism accompanies the actuators, running along the span, to transfer and tailor the mechanical work from the actuators to the span station of the flap.  The proposed research plan will work to properly size and scale the actuators and mechanism for the desired response, and construct a prototype device that demonstrates the feasibility of the concept on the bench-top and in a rotating environment at full-scale loading.* [Expandable Variable-Autonomy Architecture Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2g54-kk4v) - &lt;p&gt;Effective multi-level autonomous piloting systems require integration with safety-critical functions. The Expandable Variable-Autonomy Architecture&amp;nbsp;(EVAA)&amp;nbsp;project seeks to develop a hierarchal autonomous system framework that will depend on deterministic systems with higher authority to protect against catastrophic piloting faults and allow a lower level certification for the machine learning sub-systems. The multi-layered approach provides the framework for analytical systems that can learn, predict, and adapt to both routine and emergency situations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to develop an autonomous piloting system based on analytical and learning algorithms that are capable of making effective decisions, in both nominal and potentially catastrophic situations. This will develop a safety critical framework for certification of complex autonomous systems where a small but sufficient number of levels. The system will be integrated with a certified safety critical decision makers (such as vehicle health monitoring, collision avoidance, loss of control avoidance and restricts commands of higher level critical decision makers not certified to level A software. The project will integrate these systems onto a quad-rotor micro-UAV for inexpensive and quick flight testing of concepts and develop customized, low power hardware to house the control and decision making algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS: The purpose of this CIF project is not to develop a full scale aircraft capable of these types of advancements, but only to develop a piloting system which make them possible. Initially, decisions associated with &amp;ldquo;where to fly&amp;rdquo; will be focused on and integrated into the algorithms. For this slice of the pie, the system will be required to navigate a potentially changing dense urban landscape. Routes will be planned based on time, distance, and potential risk. Additionally, terrain and obstacle avoidance algorithms will restrict these activities based on preloaded obstacle and terrain maps. Additionally, off nominal conditions such as loss of motor or other non-pre-programmed events will cause the aircraft to select landing or crashing locations based on population density maps, location of buildings, and other information. A hangar or small area will be turned into the urban city-center mockup with maps created of the mockup to facilitate flight test of concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to date: &lt;/strong&gt;The hierarchical decision chain and framework, hardware, and embedded processing related to ground collision avoidance is in place for a sub-scale platform. Flight tests on a quad-rotor model helicopter demonstrated successful limitation of flight decisions when facing imminent ground collision.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead: &lt;/strong&gt;The team is developing a full set of safety-critical functions for the sub-scale platforms and working to scale up to larger UAVs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partners: &lt;/strong&gt;University of California at Berkeley and Stanford University are developing algorithms, and the FAA is participating in the certification process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increases safety: &lt;/strong&gt;Integration of safety-critical functions improves outcomes in emergency situations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifiable: &lt;/strong&gt;Removal of safety-critical functions from the autonomous control enables adaptable processes to be certified to a lower level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UAVs and unmanned submersibles&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Autonomous rail transport&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep space exploration&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&g* [STARwatch to Deliver Objective Sleep Measures for Spaceflight Operations, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n4f8-ybhu) - This project will achieve a wrist-worn actigraphy device called STARwatch, designed specifically for space exploration environments. It will provide a minimally obtrusive, objective measure that evaluates astronaut sleep-wake activity and light exposure. This project will leverage our second-generation actigraphy device that has already been validated in controlled laboratory experiments against gold-standard polysomnography. The compact wrist-worn device includes sensors to collect sleep metrics and will also serve as a wireless hub to collect real-time physiological data from other body-worn sensors (e.g., heart rate, EEG). It will use standardized wireless communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth) to automatically uplink data to the ISS network (no astronaut time required). Data will automatically be integrated into medical operations support systems adhering to NASA data requirements (e.g., HL7), providing immediate feedback to astronauts and flight surgeons to aid in decision-making relative to astronaut medical, behavioral health and performance issues. During Phase II, we will conduct user testing and validation in a space flight analog environment, complete product refinements, and certify STARwatch for spaceflight. (Phase II TRL of 7-8).* [Transparent and Flexible Electrodynamic Coating for Particulate Removal, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xb2w-s53v) - NASA has an unmet need for clean, dust-free surfaces critical for many mission applications: solar panels and collectors, aircraft components, optical windows, photographic equipment, and flight suits. However, dust mitigation and removal remains a difficult task, particularly given the nature and morphology of space-born particulate materials and the strong bonds they can develop with any surface. Several mechanical techniques involving shaking and wiping have been devised to address this problem, but these are difficult to implement and expensive to maintain over mission life cycles.
One successful innovation that has been developed and tested for dust removal is the "electrodynamic shield" or EDS. The EDS is composed of inter-digitated, electrically conductive electrodes connected to an AC power supply. The main parameters that govern the efficiency of dust removal are the voltage and the frequency of the AC signal applied to the electrodes. Poly Adaptive, LLC, proposes to investigate the novel application and use of nanoscale materials to address severe limitations of existing EDS designs caused by the metallic electrodes that reduce the amount of radiation reaching solar panels. Successful Phase I results will show the feasibility of an EDS that is transparent and can be placed on top of any surface.* [Revolutionize Propulsion Test Facility High-Speed Video Imaging with Disruptive Computational Photography Enabling Technology](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cw7k-fj8c) - <p>Advanced rocket propulsion testing requires high-speed video recording that can capture essential information for NASA during rocket engine flight certification ground testing. While it is important to assess all anomalies during testing, this is particularly true in the event of a mishap. The video recording in use today at NASA&rsquo;s Stennis Space Center (SSC) is significantly outdated and in need of the revolutionary approach being proposed. The current system has poor resolution and records to VHS tapes that are no longer commercially available. The system has been partially upgraded by incorporating consumer grade digital cameras, but these cameras have significant limitations including plume saturation and on-board memory storage, which make it nearly impossible, in catastrophic situations that result in the loss of a camera, to obtain critical information. This project will design and build a state-of-the-art high-speed video recording system using disruptive technologies based on emerging advances made in the field of computational photography. This system will not only provide quality, high-speed, 3-D high dynamic range video to the SSC engine test complex, but the technologies developed will be extendable to other NASA priorities including launch monitoring and space-based rover and robotics missions.&nbsp;</p><p>This project will design and build a novel state-of-the-art high-speed video recording system to provide 3-D High Dynamic Range (HDR) video imagery for operational use on the SSC engine test stands. The system will leverage newly emerging algorithms being developed within the computational photography discipline. Computational photography expands digital photography by applying computational image capture, processing, and manipulation techniques to improve image quality. HDR imaging effectively increases a camera&rsquo;s dynamic range and eliminates saturation. Juxtaposed with current imaging techniques, which often utilize either multiple cameras or a single camera with multiple exposure sequencing, the transformative approach will be implemented at the chip level using a single camera, which significantly reduces cost and implementation complexities. Three such cameras will provide multiple viewing, enabling high-speed 3-D HDR imagery, important for a more robust analysis.</p>* [Aircraft Structural Analysis, Design Optimization, and Manufacturing Tool Integration, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/96q4-h7iu) - Innovative research is proposed in integrating fundamental aircraft design processes with an emphasis on composite structures. Efficient, lightweight composite laminate structural design requires highly integrated structural analyses on the laminate and stiffened panel levels, while incorporating manufacturing processes and limitations. Laminate optimization is only one of the many design variables that need to be considered simultaneously in aircraft design. Yet true system level OML surface optimization is an extremely challenging problem that can only be made tractable by reducing the problem into three sequential gates: ply count compatibility, layup sequencing, and ply layout size and shape. The innovative approach proposed solves all three of these seemingly intractable gates and in so doing provides synergistic optimization of ply drops and adds and reduced manufacturing ply processing steps (drawing part numbers) along with laminate sizing to damage tolerance material allowables. To achieve the highest level of design fidelity requires iterative communication with the designer's CAD tool and ply zone mapping tools. Previous data exchange technology used by NASA to couple separate discipline design tools is the XML ASCII file format. Proposed is the evaluation and implementation of a binary format called 'HDF5'.* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dwtt-u9i5) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard 

total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and 

volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. 

(2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined 

using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational 

GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per 

grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional 

economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the 

range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is 

generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia 

University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and 

Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Manufacturing Advanced Channel Wall Rocket Liners, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/83a4-92eb) - Liquid rocket developers have identified advanced engine concepts that are not feasible due to manufacture due to limitations in currently available technologies. 

Specifically, engine developers are in need of a manufacturing technology that is capable of generating cooling channels in liquid rocket nozzles and combustion chambers at low cost, while supporting increasingly complex designs (see appended letter of support from Aerojet Rocketdyne).

This Phase II project will result in a reduced cost flexible technology that is ready to support the development and fabrication of advanced channel wall rocket liners and combustors.

This will be achieved by adapting a novel manufacturing technology that can machine delicate and complex features in metals and ceramics.  This technology was demonstrated to be feasible to support the advancement of channel rocket design by making more complex designs manufacturable while reducing lead time and manufacturing cost.

It was shown to reduce machine time by 90% when compared to milling the same cooling channels in stainless steel.  Advancing engine performance can be achieved through more optimal combustor and liner cooling, however engine designers are currently limited in what can be designed due to current technology slitting saw or end mill capabilities.  The proposed technology overcomes this limitation and supports the design and fabrication of highly complex and delicate features.  It can easily be scaled up to support SSME class engines.
 
At the end of Phase II, this technology will be ready to support the development of and production of channel wall rockets that incorporate more complex cooling features than are currently feasible to manufacture.  The technology will made more user friendly and efficient to implement, and a manufacturing workstation layout and cost will be developed to support both small and SSME class engines.* [Thin and Automated Blanket Lamination and Encapsulation Systems (TABLES), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yrbt-4fwf) - Flexible photovoltaic array technologies require very thin and precisely controlled deposition of the polymeric films used to fabricate them. In most flexible blanket architectures, optically transparent silicones are utilized in the fabrication of the arrays, however due to their rheology and processing conditions there are limitations to how thin they can be applied. In this proposal, Vanguard proposes Thin and Automated Blanket Lamination and Encapsulation Systems (TABLES) that utilize automated drawdown methods and rheology control to render flexible blankets approaching 700 W/kg and only 13 mils thick (including cells). Further, the TABLES concept is easily adapted to a number of substrates and superstrates, rendering "LEO to GEO" packaging and automation simply through appropriate substrate choice.* [Novel, Functionally Graded Coating System for Reusable, Very High Temperature Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v97k-iyv3) - There is a clear need to advance the state-of-the-art carbon-carbon coated Nozzle Extensions (NE) beyond the engine/mission performance currently established by Herakles technology, which is intrinsically limited to about 3000 F. The well-established SiC-based (CVD, pack cementation) technologies currently available also have upper temperature limits around 3000 F, imposing stringent limitations on increased performance and system level changes (i.e. hotter propellant) for future NASA missions. In addition, the intrinsic CTE mismatch between C-C substrate and refractory carbides/oxides further limits the use of many other classical coating technologies. The successful Phase I results established the feasibility of overcoming these limitations through the use of a novel, functionally graded (FGM) coating technology. The proposed Phase II builds on the success of the Phase I program and clearly increases its TRL by offering subscale component testing at representative engine conditions. A successful Phase II program will clearly offer a new dimension in the nozzle extensions by offering different coating systems for multi-cycle capability at temperatures from 3000 F up to 4000 F.  The expected ability of the coating to survive such an aggressive testing combined with the sufficient retention of mechanical properties offers a direct path for a Phase III with many of the commercial space payload companies. The overall approach is based upon a multi-piece C-C NE concept, which focuses the requirements for high temperature oxidation protection to smaller diameters of the nozzle extension (e.g. A cone), allowing the CVD coating technology to remain within current SOTA CVD capabilities. Larger diameter segments, which are exposed to lower temperatures, will utilize non-CVD lower cost technology which is well suited for large diameter components. The direct benefit to NASA is undisputed with direct applicability to several planned future missions, including the very challeng* [Logistics Reduction: Advanced Clothing System (ACS)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vh37-7kcv) - <p>The goal of the Advanced Exploration System (AES) Logistics Reduction&nbsp;(LR) project&#39;s Advanced Clothing System (ACS) is to use advanced commercial off-the-shelf fibers (COTS) and antimicrobial treatments to directly reduce the mass and volume of astronaut clothing. The textile industry has made significant progress with new fiber blends and garment finishing. The ACS team is leveraging existing state-of-the-art technology from private industry to make advancements in the crew wardrobe.&nbsp; There is not a clear measure of how the newer fibers contribute to longer wear in a microgravity shirt sleeve environment.&nbsp; The ACS provides a means of comparing varying fabrics through a series of controlled conditions.</p><p>The current clothing state-of-the-art on the International Space Station (ISS) is disposable, mostly cotton-based, clothing with no laundry provisions. Each clothing article has varying use&nbsp;periods and will become trash. The goal is to increase the length of wear of the clothing to reduce the logistical mass and volume.</p><p>The ACS technology is a continuation from the Logistics Reduction and Repurposing project. The initial focus was exercise clothing and routine wear tops since the use period is shorter. A ground-based experiment was conducted to evaluate current and lighter weight COTS&nbsp;exercise clothing and antimicrobial treatments to investigate if they could be used for longer periods of time. The best performers were selected for an&nbsp;experiment on the International Space Station (ISS) - Intravehicular Activity (IVA) Clothing Study. The experiment was conducted during ISS increments 39 through 41 with six crew&nbsp;members. A laundry trade-off study was conducted to quantify how longer-wear clothing changes the break-even point for laundering vs. clothing disposal. The analysis indicates that use of ACS selected garments (e.g. wool, modacrylic, polyester) can increase the breakeven point for laundry to about 300 days. ACS studies also investigated lint reduction and microbial behavior on textiles.&nbsp; The ACS task also investigated&nbsp;the subtasks of alternative laundry and clothing sanitation technologies in FY16 and FY17.&nbsp; In FY18, internal NASA technology testing will allow down select of technologies that will then notionally begin development in FY19 in parallel with new SBIR/STTR requests in key areas.</p><p>Several SBIR companies have investigated coatings to improve wear and laundering of clothing over the ACS time period.</p>* [Fault Adaptive Control of Overactuated Systems Using Prognostic Estimation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mq9r-yg32) - Most fault adaptive control research addresses the preservation of system stability or functionality in the presence of a specific failure (fault). This paper examines the fault adaptive control problem for a generic class of incipient failure modes, which do not initially affect system stability, but will eventually cause a catastrophic failure to occur. This risk of catastrophic failure due a component fault mode is some monotonically increasing function of the load on the component. Assuming that a probabilistic prognostic model is available to evaluate the risk of incipient fault modes growing into catastrophic failure conditions, then fundamentally the fault adaptive control problem is to adjust component
loads to minimize risk of failure, while not overly degrading nominal performance. A methodology is proposed for posing this problem as a finite horizon constrained optimization, where constraints correspond to maximum risk of failure and maximum deviation from nominal performance. Development of the methodology to handle a general class of overactuated systems is given. Also, the fault adaptive control methodology is demonstrated on an application example of practical significance, an electro-mechanical actuator (EMA) consisting of three DC motors geared to the same output shaft. Similar actuator systems are commonly used in aerospace, transportation, and industrial processes to actuate critical loads, such as aircraft control surfaces. The fault mode simulated in the system is a temperature dependent motor winding insulation degradation.* [Prognostic Health-Management System Development for Electromechanical Actuators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7prv-6yvh) - Electro-mechanical actuators (EMAs) have been gaining increased acceptance as safety-critical actuation devices in the next generation of aircraft and spacecraft.  The aerospace manufacturers are not ready, however, to completely embrace EMAs for all applications due to apprehension with regard to some of the more critical fault modes.  This work aims to help address these concerns by developing and testing a prognostic health management system that diagnoses EMA faults and employs prognostic algorithms to track fault progression and predict the actuator remaining useful life. The diagnostic algorithm is implemented using a combined model-based and data-driven reasoner. The prognostic algorithm, implemented using Gaussian Process Regression, estimates the remaining life of the faulted component. The paper also covers the selection of fault modes for coverage and methods developed for fault injection. Validation experiments were conducted both in laboratory and flight conditions using the Flyable Electromechanical Actuator (FLEA) test stand. The FLEA allows test actuators to be subjected to realistic environmental and operating conditions, while providing the capability to safely inject and monitor propagation of various fault modes. The paper covers both diagnostic and prognostic, run-to-failure experiments, conducted in laboratory and flight conditions for several types of faults. The experiments demonstrated robust fault diagnosis on the selected set of component and sensor faults and high-accuracy predictions of failure time in prognostic scenarios.* [Developing, Maintaining, and Restoring Team Cohesion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uhe2-dj9w) - Team cohesion, as an important team process factor, has been researched in the psychological literature for well over 50 years. Several meta-analytic investigations have firmly established its contribution to team effectiveness (Beal, Cohen, Burke, & McLendon, 2003; Gully, Devine, & Whitney, 1995; Mullen & Copper, 1994), particularly for teams performing complex, interdependent tasks. Team cohesion is primarily viewed as a motivational team process that captures the interpersonal attraction of team members to each other (social cohesion) and the commitment of members to the team mission (task cohesion). Although task cohesion is more strongly related to team performance, both factors are important because problems with social cohesion can “spill over” to undermine task cohesion, other relevant team processes, and team performance (Kozlowski & Ilgen, 2006). Thus, the capability to intervene to enhance the development, maintenance, and restoration of team cohesion for flight crews and ground control teams is essential to the overall mission effectiveness for the NASA strategic plan for space exploration (NASA, 2008).     <p></p>
Team cohesion, good collaboration, and psychosocial health are essential ingredients for effective “high reliability” action teams that perform critical tasks in isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environments, such as teams of astronauts. Although a substantial amount of research has established a relationship between team cohesion and team effectiveness, very little research examines how teams collaborate and maintain cohesion, effective teamwork, and psychosocial health over time. That is, the vast majority of the research is based on static, cross-sectional data. There is simply very little research examining team cohesion and team functioning over short, medium, and long duration missions. Thus, basic research to examine team interaction dynamics is needed to develop effective and obtrusive assessment methods, monitoring technologies, and team regulation tools and techniques to enable crew members and mission controllers to maintain, sustain, and adapt team collaboration to achieve team effectiveness. That is the focus of this research effort.    <p></p>
This ground-based research focused on three primary areas of activity:    <p></p>
1.	We worked to gain access to NASA analog environments with the goal of benchmarking team cohesion variability and fluctuations for teams operating under ICE conditions.     <p></p>
•	Establishing normative benchmarks for team interaction and function is critical to (later) being able to detect anomalies that necessitate countermeasures.      <p></p>
2.	We developed and prototyped a technology platform (i.e., a wireless sensor system) to provide an unobtrusive measurement system for monitoring team interactions and assessing psychosocial health.     <p></p>
•	Real time cohesion and collaboration assessment will be critical to monitoring team effectiveness and triggering countermeasures.    <p></p>
3.	We prototyped the use of behavioral metrics to assess team cohesion, which is a critical first step for establishing the utility of the monitoring technology, and initiated a phased validation process to demonstrate the potential of the monitoring technology and measurement system.     <p></p>
•	It is essential that the technology system provides reliable, valid, and useful metrics for assessing the nature and quality of team interactions. <p></p>* [Ground-Based Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Cumulative Station Position Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/767v-9ehg) - Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Data (multi-day files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis to compute station position solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. The IDS Analysis Center Coordinator combines these individual AC solutions to generate a long-term DORIS position and velocity cumulative solution through a piecewise linear (position+velocity) model to describe the station motions. The cumulative position and velocity solution is obtained from the stacking of the weekly solution files and is then aligned to the current ITRF. The residuals of this stacking are of particular interest since they depict non-linear station motions. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/DORIS/DORIS_product_holdings.html.* [Monthly Climate Data for Selected USGS HCDN Sites, 1951-1990](https://data.nasa.gov/d/82eh-jb5c) - Time series of monthly minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were derived for 1337 watersheds in the conterminous United States for sites found in the national streamflow database, termed the hydroclimatologic data network (HCDN), developed by Slack et al. (1993a,b). Estimates were derived for the years 1951-1990.This HCDN data set consists of records of average daily streamflow at 1553 sites located throughout the United States. The data meet certain measurement accuracy criterion outlined by Slack et al. (1993). The HCDN contains river flows from 1874 to 1988, with an average record length of 44 years. The streamflow data included in the HCDN is purported to be relatively free from anthropogenic influences and the accuracy ratings of these records are at least rated good per USGS standards. A subset of the HCDN streamflow sites from 1337 watersheds with at least 10 years of record length was used. This subset includes 1376 HCDN sites.The climate characteristic estimates of temperature and precipitation were estimated using the PRISM (Daly et al. 1994, 1997) climate analysis system as described in Vogel, et al. 1999.Estimates of monthly potential evaporation were obtained using a method introduced by Hargreaves and Samani (1982) which is based on monthly time series of average minimum and maximum temperature data along with extraterrestrial solar radiation. Extraterrestrial solar radiation was estimated for each HCDN basin by computing the solar radiation over 0.1 degree grids using the method introduced by Duffie and Beckman (1980) and then summing those estimates for each river basin. This process is described in Sankarasubramanian, Vogel, and Limbrunner, 2001.The data files are organized in directories by parameter, Tmax, Tmin, Pre, and PET, and contain 18 subdirectories representing the 18 HCDN regions. Each region subdirectory contains data files for the monthly time series of respective hydroclimate attributes (Tmax, Tmin, Precipitation, and PET) for the individual HCDN sites in that region for the years 1951-1990. All files are in space delimited ASCII format.* [Fire Danger Assessment System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/998c-mrww) - <p>A fire danger dataset for the continental US based on satellite hydrology information, this can be updated monthly and used operationally to distribute fire response resources. &nbsp;The project involved working together with fire-community end-users and developing a data product that can be utilized for future NASA research solicitations in hydrology, disasters, and applied sciences programs, as well as other agency (e.g. NOAA) program solicitations.</p><p>Quantify fire-moisture relationships. &nbsp;At seasonal to annual time-scales, we will use the published relationships between sea surface temperatures and regional fire likelihood as a baseline predictor for a good or bad fire year [Chen et al., 2016], and extend this methodology to include terrestrial water storage information from GRACE. &nbsp;That long-term prediction will then be combined with a seasonal-to-monthly predictive approach based on surface moisture conditions [Rousseau et al., 2015]. &nbsp;We also will use GRACE-assimilated land surface model outputs of surface soil moisture (top 2.5 cm) at 12.5-km resolution in the continental US. &nbsp;At sub-seasonal time-scales (i.e. daily to monthly) we will use assimilated soil moisture and AIRS VPD to estimate future fire risk [e.g., Stavros et al., 2014]. &nbsp;The GFED4 fire occurrence and burned area database [Giglio et al., 2013], which has several significant improvements compared with earlierGFED versions, will be used with the predictor variables in a multi-regression approach that employs efficient parameterization. This results in a multi-variable algorithm for global seasonal/monthly/weekly fire danger. &nbsp;Two additional exploratory analyses will be undertaken if time permits: (i) Investigation of whether canopy and ground fuel moisture can be predicted using the SMAP vegetation water content product; (ii) Investigation of ECOSTRESS data usefulness and predictive viability. &nbsp;Both are subject to data quality and availability limitations. A remote sensing-based methodology for wall-to-wall fuel moisture levels would be extremely valuable to fire managers for optimizing suppression and firefighting resources.</p>* [Aeroelastic Uncertainty Analysis Toolbox, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/iwza-w6i4) - Flutter is a potentially explosive phenomenon that is the result of the simultaneous interaction of aerodynamic, structural, and inertial forces.  The analytical prediction of flutter in the transonic regime requires high fidelity simulation models that are computationally expensive.  Due to the computational demands, traditional uncertainty analysis is not often applied to flutter prediction, resulting in reduced confidence in the results.  This Phase I research is aimed at exploring methods to reduce the previous computational time limitations of traditional uncertainty analysis. To dramatically reduce the computational burden of uncertainty analysis, Systems Technology, Inc. proposes to investigate both the coupling of Design of Experiment (DOE) and Response Surface Methods (RSM), and the application of robust stability techniques, namely μ-analysis.  Using Reduced Order Models (ROM), the DOE/RSM and μ-analysis approaches will be compared to traditional Monte Carlo based stochastic simulation.  The result of the Phase I program will be to demonstrate the utility of the core elements of the Aeroelastic Uncertainty Analysis Toolbox (AUAT).  AUAT will contain multiple methods for addressing flutter uncertainty analysis, coupled with a state-of-the-art nonlinear aeroelastic code.* [Aero-Effected Distributed Adaptive Control of Flexible Aircraft Using Active Bleed, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g3cu-9se9) - The proposed research focuses on the development of a new adaptive
control methodology for active control of wing aerodynamic shape to
effect distributed aerodynamic forces and moments for maneuvering and
stabilization of flexible airframes without moving control surfaces.
The new aero-effected flight control will be achieved using output
feedback adaptive control of distributed bleed across aerodynamic
surfaces, and is particularly suited for high-altitude long endurance
vehicles.  The large-area air bleed is driven by the inherent pressure
differences in flight across the pressure and suction wing surface, and
is regulated by low-power, surface-integrated louver valves.  Our
previous basic research in adaptive control has stressed the ability to
model and cancel the effect of uncertainty in output regulation.  We
also have developed methods for adaptation in the presence of nonlinear
actuation, which includes such effects as actuator saturation.  These
tools are currently being employed in the study of active flow control
using synthetic jet actuation, and will be adapted to the problems that
are unique to improving aeroelastic performance and active damping of
airframe-propulsion-structure interactions using distributed bleed.
Phase I will focus on advancing the state of the art in output feedback
adaptive control, and demonstration of the capability of aero-bleed to
control the dynamic modes of a flexible lifting surface.  These efforts
will be integrated in Phase-II by using an adaptive controller to
regulate a flexible wing flown in three degrees of freedom in a wind
tunnel experiment, using an existing traverse mechanism.  Another option
is to use Atair Aerospace's LEAPP vehicle to flight test a highly
flexible wing design.  Additional Phase-II and Phase-III transition
possibilities include coordinated research efforts with Boeing related
to the DARPA Vulture vehicle, and/or with AeroVironment related to the
Global Observer vehicle.* [FLEXible Damage Detection and Verification System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/eaq8-9x23) - <p>This&nbsp;project expands on the previously demonstrated Flat Surface Damage Detection System (FSDDS) capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Flexible Damage Detection and Verification&nbsp;System (FLEX-DDVS)&nbsp; is&nbsp;currently being formulated for consideration as an inspection/damage detection system for Orbital Debris (OD) and Micrometeoroid (MM) impacts and particle characterization capabilities for a potential International Space Station (ISS) ExPRESS Payload Adapter (ExPA) payload technology demonstration flight experiment.

the 5-100 kg size range. A potentially disruptive technology, small
satellites, which are low cost and can be delivered in months, are being
eyed as platforms for rapid demonstration of new technologies and even
important science missions. From NASA's recently launched PharmaSat
sub-10 kg free-flying nanosatellite, which has just successfully
completed an experiment that could help scientists better understand how
effectively drugs work in space, to potential future missions like
CRESPO, a ~100 kg microsatellite that will use a hyperspectral imager to
monitor the condition of more than 50&#37; of the Earth's coral reefs over a
2-year period, NASA is counting on these small satellites to deliver.  A
miniature PMB technology is widely applicable to small mechanisms and
will allow for a greater technological payoff with the next generation
of small satellite missions.  Honeybee Robotics is developing a small,
modular control moment gyroscope (CMG) technology for use on small
satellites. The life limiting and power driving aspect of this
technology as with any CMG or reaction wheel (RW), are the rotor
bearings which operate at 12,000 rpm. Honeybee Robotics proposes to
develop a miniature passive magnetic bearing (PMB) for small satellite
ACS components such as CMGs and RWs. This cross-cutting technology can
also be applied to any small mechanism that might benefit from low
parasitic torque, low induced vibration (IV), and long life. PMB
technology for small satellites will allow for a step increase in life
for their ACS subsystems. Enabling a small satellite mission lifetime of
15+ years rather than 1-3 years is a game-changing development that will
alter the way mission planners think about small satellite capabilities.
Prototype units will be integrated with our Tiny Operationally
Responsive CMG (TORC) technology to demonstrate the relative merits
compared to traditional ball bearings.* [Safe, High Specific Energy & Power Li-ion Cells](https://data.nasa.gov/d/facg-a3je) - <p>Today&rsquo;s best, <strong>safe</strong> commercial Li-ion cell designs achieve ~180 Wh/kg, ~500 Wh/L, and 400 W/kg. When accounting for the lightest (1.35) parasitic mass and smallest (2.0) parasitic volume factors of proven battery construction features, this means that at the battery level we need improvements of 144% and 170%, respectively, to achieve our specific energy (&gt;325 Wh/kg) and energy density (&gt;540 Wh/L) performance targets. Today&rsquo;s best commercial Li-ion cell designs offer the promise of a 47% and 82% improvements, respectively, over the State of the Art&nbsp;as shown in Fig. 1 below. Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t implement these new cell designs, which are safe enough for small consumer batteries but are unsafe for larger manned applications due to the high propensity for them to side wall rupture during thermal runaway.</p><p>This proposal offers to overcome this safety issue and enable significant progress towards the Evolving Mars Campaign (EMC) target. We seek our advanced battery designs to be passively propagation resistant to a single cell thermal runaway (TR). Key to this goal is greatly reducing the risk of side wall rupture of the hot thermal runaway products ejected from the cell (a.k.a., ejecta). Side wall ruptures create a blow torch effect&nbsp;which, when impinging on adjacent cells, causes nearly immediate TR propagation in a closely-packed battery designs.</p><p>The higher energy content (265 Wh/kg, 725 Wh/L) of the newer cell designs from LG, Panasonic, and Samsung have made them susceptible to side wall ruptures during thermal runaway, rather than venting through the intended vent path in the cell header. This is also due to higher reaction kinetics of the electrochemistry, thinner can walls, tight crimp enclosure of the cell header, and inadequate flow rate through the header vent. Tesla Motors was the first to recognize and address this issue by asking cell manufacturers to produce cell designs with bottom burst disc vents. &nbsp;However, those designs exclusively for Tesla and not available to others. Thus, we must stay with lower performing cell designs or implement structural supporting features for the cells in the battery designs. Both options limit battery achievable specific energy to at best 133 Wh/kg. Being able to safely implement the newest cell designs with bottom vents will enable reaching 196 Wh/kg at the battery level. This 47% improvement would save 24 lbs per each 4 kWh MPCV battery or 96 lbs per MPCV flight or enable 1 hour flight run time for the X-57 electric plane by saving 282 lbs from their 46 kWh battery. Similar volume savings impacts are possible by retiring the side wall rupture risk, because it allows cells to be safely nested together more efficiently. These sizable mass/volume savings and safety improvements are aligned with the needs of the EMC.</p><p>Safe, higher performing batteries are well aligned with EMC needs for high specific power, high specific energy batteries, long life batteries, and deep space suit specific energies &nbsp;&gt;235 Wh/kg.</p><p>The required vent paths are achieved by scoring a groove pattern in bottom of the mild steel can. Although they look simple, achieving a reliably performing bottom vent is not trivial. Weaker designs are excessively susceptible to corrosion, leakage, damage, and poor performance uniformity. The important question that this research project will answer is whether our design will significantly reduce the side wall rupture risk without significant limitations, such as leakage, corrosion, and excessive performance variations.</p><p>The scope of the project includes conducting TR tests on similar cells with and without the bottom vent to show the merits of the bottom vent feature. Just 3 months ago, Sony Energy became the first to make a commercially available, high performing design with a bottom vent. We have taken delivery of 400 such SONY cells last month.

This network represents the only coordinated and standardized program of observations using standard measurement protocols designed to observe and detect decadal changes in the dynamics of seasonal thawing and freezing in high-latitude soils. The Intellectual Merit of this study lies in the need for long-term time series of active layer depth, ground temperature, and thaw settlement measurements at the same locations and across diverse terrain types and regions in order to identify scales of spatial variation, establish trends, and validate models.

The active layer thickness is measured by physical probing on grids ranging in size from 100 to 1000 meters, by probing at a single point or along transects or from permanently installed frost tubes and soil temperature cables. Sites include several coastal to inland transects in North America, a longitudinal array of sites across Eurasia, and individual sites in several mid-latitude, mountainous regions. The majority of the sites are in arctic tundra regions consisting of fine grained sediments. Bouldery and rocky sites in mountains are being added to the network primarily in Europe as part of the EC Permafrost and Climate in Europe (PACE) project. CALM is being considered as the part of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). 

CALM is closely affiliated with the International Permafrost Association (IPA), several IPA working groups, and the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). The current protocol for observing the active layer thickness is given in the published ITEX Manual and on the ITEX and IPA Web sites. These activities are part of the IPA Global Geocryological Database (GGD). 

A map on the CAPS CD-ROM illustrates the locations of the 130 sites. A comprehensive metadata file for all sites is available. The CAPS CD-ROM contains detailed metadata and summary data and can be ordered from the Order Data Button and the data can be obtained from the Order External Data Button.* [Broad-bandwidth Metamaterial Antireflection Coatings for Sub-Millimeter Astronomy and CMB Foreground Removal](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5k6g-z8wq) - Sub-millimeter observations are crucial for answering questions about star and galaxy formation; understanding galactic dust foregrounds; and for removing these foregrounds to detect the faint signature of inflationary gravitational waves in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Achieving these goals requires improved, broad-band antireflection coated lenses and half-wave plates (HWPs).  These optical elements will significantly boost the sensitivity and capability of future sub-millimeter and CMB missions.

We propose to develop wide-bandwidth metamaterial antireflection coatings for silicon lenses and sapphire HWPs with 3:1 ratio bandwidth that are scalable across the sub-millimeter band from 300 GHz to 3 THz.  This is an extension of our successful work on saw cut metamaterial AR coatings for silicon optics at millimeter wave lengths. These, and the proposed coatings consist of arrays of sub-wavelength scale features cut into optical surfaces that behave like simple dielectrics.  We have demonstrated saw cut 3:1 bandwidth coatings on silicon lenses, but these coatings are limited to the millimeter wave band by the limitations of dicing saw machining.  The crucial advance needed to extend these broad band coatings throughout the sub-millimeter band is the development of laser cut graded index metamaterial coatings.  The proposed work includes developing the capability to fabricate these coatings, optimizing the design of these metamaterials, fabricating and testing prototype lenses and HWPs, and working with the PIPER collaboration to achieve a sub-orbital demonstration of this technology.  The proposed work will develop potentially revolutionary new high performance coatings for the sub-millimeter bands, and cary this technology to TRL 7 paving the way for its use in space.  We anticipate that there will be a wide range of  applications for these coatings on future NASA balloons and satellites.* [Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) on ISS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s6vw-3v2s) - The Psychomotor Vigilance (PVT) Self Test (operational name on International Space Station (ISS) is Reaction Self Test (RST)) is intended to provide astronauts in spaceflight with objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in vigilant attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, as well as recording their subjective ratings of workload, sleep timing and quality, tiredness, fatigue, and stress. The PVT Self Test is suited for repeated use in spaceflight because unlike other cognitive tests, it is very brief (less than 5 minutes) while being free of learning effects and aptitude differences that make interpretation of other cognitive measures difficult.     <p></p>
Our initial Reaction Self Test study evaluated 24 astronauts, before, during, and after 6-month missions on the International Space Station (ISS). A total of 2,856 RST evaluations were obtained from 21 astronauts participating in 6-month ISS missions.    <p></p>
To determine whether there were continuing changes in Reaction Self Test outcomes for ISS missions greater than 6-month duration, a study was conducted on the RST outcomes of N=2 participants in the initial 1-year mission (i.e., one US astronaut and one Russian cosmonaut). The following are the objectives (specific aims) of the project for the 1-year mission. The US astronaut and Russian cosmonaut were evaluated within the 1-year mission, and relative to data from the N=21 astronauts in 6-month missions.      <p></p>
1)	Evaluate whether there were changes in sleep duration and/or sleep quality within the 1-year mission (i.e., first 6 months compared to the second 6 months of the 1-year mission), and differences in these outcomes between the 1-year and 6-month missions.    <p></p>

Inflatable habitats are key to reducing the weight of space structures, enabling future long term missions and planetary habitation. There is a need for monitoring the structural health of these habitats, as many of the methods used on earth are not applicable to the space environment or the materials used. To accomplish this goal, Luna has teamed with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) who is a leader in the development of CNT sensor technology. Luna is teaming with an established manufacturer to fabricate a sub-scale inflatable structure with integrated SHM sensors which will enable thorough characterization of the approach. During Phase I, the team successfully demonstrated damage detection in an inflatable prototype as well as dynamic impact detection of soft goods layers with the technologies. Phase II will focus on increasing the TRL of the sensing technologies and preparing for transition into future NASA missions. Phase III will focus on commercializing the technology with NASA and NASA affiliates.* [Human Research Program](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j97r-4atq) - &lt;p&gt;Strategically, the HRP conducts research and technology development that: 1) enables the development or modification of Agency-level human health and performance standards by the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO) and 2) provides Human Exploration Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) with methods of meeting those standards in the design, development, and operation of mission systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HRP research focuses on reducing crew health and performance risks for exploration missions.&amp;nbsp; In addition, HRP research gathers the data necessary to understand and mitigate the long-term health risks to the crew, to allow the update of specific crew health standards for each mission scenario, to support crew selection, and to address any rehabilitation requirements.&amp;nbsp; The OCHMO owns and sets the standards upon which the HRP research efforts are based.&amp;nbsp; The Transition to Medical Practice process defined by the OCHMO is used to review the HRP deliverable countermeasures and technologies prior to their operational use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HRP technology development advances medical care and countermeasure systems for exploration and vehicle development programs&amp;rsquo; missions.&amp;nbsp; The HRP also develops and matures operational concepts to inform requirements for the design and operation of space vehicles and habitats needed for exploration.&amp;nbsp; This includes requirements for displays and controls, internal environments, operations planning, habitability, and methodologies for maintaining crew physical and mental health as well as physical and cognitive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HRP is managed at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) and comprised of six research and technology development projects.&amp;nbsp; These projects provide the program knowledge and capabilities to conduct research addressing the human health and performance risks as well as advancing the readiness levels of technology and countermeasures to the point of transfer to the customer programs and organizations.&amp;nbsp; The six projects within the HRP are referred to as Program Elements throughout this document.&amp;nbsp; Each Element is managed at the JSC with research and technology development expertise provided by JSC, Ames Research Center (ARC), Glenn Research Center (GRC), the Langley Research Center (LaRC), and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), as well as other Agencies, institutions and organizations identified in the following Element descriptions.&amp;nbsp; The six Elements are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Space Radiation (SR) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The SR Element performs investigations to develop the scientific basis to accurately predict and mitigate health risks from the space radiation environment.&amp;nbsp; This knowledge yields recommendations to permissible exposure limits, assessment/projection tools/models of crew risk from radiation exposure, and models/tools to assess vehicle design for radiation protection.&amp;nbsp; The SR Element conducts research using accelerator-based simulation of space radiation.&amp;nbsp; The SR Element explores and develops countermeasures to the deleterious effects of radiation on human health.&amp;nbsp; The LaRC and ARC contribute to the SR Element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The BHP Element identifies and characterizes the behavioral and performance risks associated with training, living and working in space, and returning to Earth.&amp;nbsp; The BHP Element develops strategies, tools, and technologies to mitigate these risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The ExMC Element is responsible for defining requirements for crew health maintenance during exploration missions, developing treatment scenarios, extrapolating from the scenarios t* [Human Performance Metrics for Spacesuit Evaluation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bmc6-3qjz) - Introduction: Human spaceflight and exploration beyond low-earth orbit requires providing crewmembers life support systems in various extreme environments, such as microgravity, the moon, and Mars, in the form of extravehicular activity (EVA) spacesuits. Critical to mission success is the ability for crewmembers to successfully perform a series of mission-related operational tasks while mitigating risks to health and injury. Therefore, methods for evaluating suited human performance and spacesuit design need to incorporate complex mission related dynamics, such as operationally relevant tasks. Important to suited EVA performance is minimizing the risk to crew health to avoid crewmember overexertion and injury and ensure mission success. The proposed method will develop and validate quantitative metrics for decisions that are currently made qualitatively with regard to a spacesuit design's risk to astronaut health and injury during EVA operations.

Problem Statement: There are currently no quantitative methods for computing the health and injury risk to suited crewmembers in operationally relevant settings. Understanding the mobility and performance needs of astronauts during EVA aids in mitigating the jeopardy to crew member health. This requires a quantitative toolset for comparing and evaluating current and future human spacesuit performance as a means of designing innovative future spacesuits that mitigate these risks to crewmember health.

Research Plan: A standardized method for evaluating EVA performance and injury risk provides methodology for innovating and robustness for defining the requirements of future spacesuit systems. Inclusion of user and decision maker needs in the evaluation processes maximizes usability, understanding, and implementation of novel evaluation methods, expediting the design iterations of future systems and the understanding of human spacesuit performance. To this end, the specific aims of this study are as follows:

Aim 1: Use of cognitive task analysis to determine a series of operationally relevant assessments, tasks, needs for decision makers during the evaluation of human spacesuit performance in the context of defining spacesuit design requirements for minimizing risk to crew health. 

Aim 2: Creation of appropriate new performance metrics and data acquisition modalities to quantify performance during operationally relevant tasks. 

Aim 3: Validation of operationally relevant, quantitative performance metrics with operational decision makers.

Impact: The proposed framework enables a standardized method to determine an astronaut's risk to health and injury during EVA operations. These metrics can then be used by suit design engineers to make decisions on the appropriate Do Not Harm requirements for current and future spacesuit designs.* [Monitoring of Thermal Protection Systems using Robust Self-Organizing Optical Fiber Sensing Networks](https://data.nasa.gov/d/53nn-ii6a) - <p>Effective thermal protection systems are crucial for spacecraft or future hypersonic transports re-entering the atmosphere. Micro-meteoroids and orbital debris (MMODs) are an increasingly dangerous problem for near-Earth operations. This system uses a network of optical fiber sensors to map heat shield strains and temperatures using decentralized "agent based" algorithms in a sensor network.<p/><p>Virtually every program across the agency needs the ability to detect and assess the impact of MMOD.  We are developing and demonstrating robust, dynamically-reconfigurable optical fiber sensor networks for on-orbit damage detection.   Objectives The project has the following objectives: a)    Development, evaluation and demonstration of a dynamically reconfigurable optical fiber sensing network that is interrogated using the optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) technique. Such a system will substantially reduce the susceptibility of optical fiber sensing systems to failure in the event of fiber breakage. b)    Development and demonstration of a distributed, self-organized approach to configuration control of an optical fiber sensing network that is interrogated using the optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) technique. c)    Demonstrate fiber optic distributed strain and temperature sensing on a small-scale heat shield carrier structure. d)    Development and demonstration of a method for determining optimal sensor placements with the aim of maintaining adequate accuracy of impact and damage location. e)    Development and demonstration of acoustic detection and thermal evaluation of impact damage to a thermal protection system (TPS) attached to the carrier structure of goal c) above.   Approach This work will be carried out jointly by Armstrong Flight Research Center and CSIRO Materials Science & Engineering, Sydney, Australia. It will leverage off developments from earlier NASA/CSIRO work on structural health monitoring, in particular on the development of a distributed multi-agent system demonstrator for impact detection and damage characterization, which was co-funded by CSIRO. Principle of combined acoustic emission/thermal monitoring of TPS The general aim of this work is to develop and demonstrate a prototype structural health monitoring system for thermal protection systems (TPS) that incorporates piezoelectric acoustic emission (AE) sensors to detect the occurrence and location of damaging impacts, and an optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor network to evaluate the effect of detected damage on the thermal conductivity of the TPS material. Following detection of an impact, the TPS would be exposed to a heat source, possibly the sun, and the temperature distribution on the inner surface in the vicinity of the impact measured by the FBG network. A similar procedure could also be carried out as a screening test immediately prior to re-entry. The implications of any detected anomalies in the measured temperature distribution will be evaluated for their significance in relation to the performance of the TPS during re-entry. Structure of optical fiber network An important aspect of this proposal is the development of a robust, electronically-reconfigurable FBG network that employs the optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) technique to measure temperature-induced strains in the Bragg gratings. The network will have a high degree of redundancy to ensure its continued effectiveness in the event of damage to one or more fiber segments. Light will be routed around damaged fiber segments, so that the network can continue to operate even when some regions of it are damaged. Network routing/configuration could be: i)        controlled from a central processor, using wired or wireless communications; or ii)      determined using a distributed, self-organized approach to control of the sensor network. This approach has been outlined in a recent Contractor Report (Scott & Price, NASA/CR-2007-215092).

The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool that unobtrusively integrates all available behavioral measures collected during a mission to provide a dashboard of behavioral health indicators. These indicators will be placed within the context of quantitatively-tracked mission stressors to provide meaningful feedback to astronauts, and possibly the Operational Psychology Group and Flight Surgeons responsible for behavioral health support. The result of this project through Phase II will be a system prototype that can be deployed in space analog environments for validation testing and ultimately deployed on ISS and lunar missions. The critical need for an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP Integrated Research Plan (July 2009) gap BMED3. During Phase I, we will perform an assessment of behavioral health monitoring technologies and develop an engineering requirements document and detailed technical plans to implement during Phase II (Phase I TRL of 3).* [The DEEP Project: DEtecting Extraterrestrial Piezophiles in Ocean World Analogs](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gmte-fzu3) - OBJECTIVES :
Searching for extraterrestrial life necessitates a better understanding of the unique aspects of life detection in the high-pressure, deep oceans of Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. Generally, Earth’s oceans are similar to these extraterrestrial ocean worlds, but the closest analogs are deep-sea hydrothermal vents where microbes cycle nutrients and energy across a range of geochemical conditions. All of these ecosystems share one central physical parameter - high hydrostatic pressure - and piezophily is the common characteristic of life in the deep ocean. This high-pressure adaptation confers a competitive advantage to piezophiles, allowing them to access additional energy sources and expand habitable niches. While deep-sea microbes have been studied extensively, obligate piezophiles remain elusive, excluded by traditional decompressive sampling techniques.
Putative microbial communities in the deep oceans of Europa, Enceladus, and Titan would necessarily be piezophiles, therefore instrument development for upcoming missions to ocean worlds must include the ability to (1) detect life under high pressure conditions and/or (2) develop sample handling and life detection analysis protocols that mitigate the effects of sample decompression on analytical outcomes. The DEEP project will take advantage of a new high pressure sampling system (PUSH50) that allows for sample retrieval and manipulation without decompression. Here we propose a field research program to the Earth’s deepest hydrothermal vents, the Mid Cayman Rise, in order to develop high pressure sample handling protocols that optimize life detection in high pressure environments.
METHODOLOGY:
We will evaluate the fidelity of a range of life detection techniques on a variety of deep-sea vent samples for which in situ pressures have been maintained throughout the analytical process, and compare these to parallel samples that have been subjected to standard decompressive techniques. We aim to:
(1) identify the most robust suite of analyses for life detection in high pressure ecosystems;
(2) determine the instrumental/analytical requirements for in situ life detection on future ocean worlds missions.
In situ detection of microbial communities will include: quantification of cell and biomass; characterization of species and metabolic diversity; enrichment cultivation for high value target metabolisms;  and measurement of geochemical isotopic biosignatures. Many of these techniques can be (and are currently being) adapted for remote deployment on landers and rovers. Our proposed research will identify which of these techniques is most robust in high-pressure environments, optimize in situ analysis protocols for high-pressure ecosystems, and develop the technology necessary to implement these protocols in upcoming mission instrument packages
SIGNIFICANCE
This work addresses the following PSTAR Objectives. Science: We will elucidate the processes by which high pressure microbiomes are sensitive to traditional decompression sampling, characterize the metabolic and species diversity that has been obscured by these techniques, and develop new approaches to detecting these enigmatic piezophiles in high pressure environments. Technology: We will perform the first tests of a newly developed sampling system that maintains high in situ pressures during recovery. We will further develop the technology and protocols necessary for carrying out life detection under high pressures.* [Airborne Wide Area Imager for Wildfire Mapping and Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4dp6-svkm) - An autonomous airborne imaging system for earth science research, disaster response, and fire detection is proposed.  The primary goal is to improve information to researchers and operations personnel.  By operating autonomously and with higher spatial resolution, the system will deliver a 3X to 4X reduction in operating costs compared to current systems.  The system uses a two color Quantum Well Infrared Photo detector (QWIP) to improve the accuracy of energy release from wildfires, thereby improving our understanding of the carbon cycle. 

The system includes a multi-sensor step-stare imager, position and attitude sensor, data communications link, and a data processing system with; feature extraction (such as fire detection), image geo-coding, and image compression.  

The sensor head is an innovative design combining high resolution framing devices (cameras) with a step-stare scanning mirror.  This configuration results in high spatial resolution imagery and wide area coverage.  The design of the sensor head is flexible allowing for a variety of imagers including; visible and IR cameras and/or hyperspectral sensors.  We envision several versions of the instrument, one weighing around 75 pounds and a smaller version weighing less than 15 pounds.* [Ground-Based Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Station Position Time Series Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7w6s-762z) - Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Data (multi-day files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis and after producing the weekly SINEX files using the current ITRF, compute station position time series solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. The IDS Analysis Center Coordinator combines these individual AC solutions to generate the official IDS DORIS network time series solution in the IDS STCD (Station Coordinates Difference) format. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/DORIS/DORIS_product_holdings.html.* [Physiological and Environmental Sensor Skin Stamp](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ikug-mivp) - <p>Future exploration missions will require astronauts to autonomously monitor physiological and atmospheric conditions. Recent technological advances in the developing field of wearable technologies has led to designs capable of measuring atmospheric conditions in addition to the more common physiological monitoring uses; however, these separate capabilities have not been packaged into a single monitoring system with real-time feedback.&nbsp; A conformable and flexible &quot;skin stamp&quot; instrumented with electronics and sensors to measure atmospheric conditions and physiological health during daily exercise, EVA, and exploration tasks would provide an easy to implement method to protect astronauts&rsquo; health and save cost and space during all phases of the Journey to Mars. Additionally, advancement of this technology could be used to immediately enhance ISS medical monitoring capabilities and in other isolated environments such as military training and off shore rigging.</p>
 <p>Advancing human exploration beyond low earth orbit and ISS will require improved and more autnomous health monitoring systems, highlighting the importance of integrating multiple medical devices in one platform with focus on early detection of remediable conditions. Skin-mounted biosensors provide the capability to monitor indicators of physical performance and fatigue (i.e. heart rate, hydration, temperature, oxygen saturation).&nbsp; NASA exploration needs requirements doucment specfically calls out&nbsp;capabilities for environmental monitoring to quickly detect changes that could result in an unfavorable habitation. As an example,&nbsp;daily exercise sessions may stress the Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) Systems on exploration vehicles due to heat generation, sweat production, and carbon dioxide accumulation. Accordingly, there is a need to develop sensors that can simultaneously monitor physiological health and atmospheric conditions (i.e. temperature, humidity, gas concentrations) during Mars proving-ground and Earth-Independent missions. The proposed wearable &ldquo;skin stamp&rdquo; multi-parametric sensor will be a novel design with dual-use technology in mind to monitor both biomedical and atmospheric conditions in a single platform</p>

<p>The proposed &quot;skin stamp&quot; sensor will be designed, fabricated, and tested as a collaborative effort between SK and University of Houston Engineering Department. The teams expertise in sensor and materials design, physiological monitoring and testing, and exploration are necessary to successfully develop a suite of sensors in a single platform that is optimized for exploration within the budget and time constraints of this ICA. We propose to strategically assemble a suite of atmospheric and physiological monitoring sensors in a conformable skin mounted fabric and integrate key design features including ease of use, single platform, high data quality, durability, and real-time monitoring. We will leverage previous high-performance flexible electronic material assemblies developed by UH. The hardware will undergo rigorous evaluations at different environmental temperatures.</p>

<p>The product of this effort will be a novel prototype multi-sensor skin patch that allows for accurate, real-time physiological and atmospheric monitoring in a single platform design. The first 8 weeks will focus on sensor development, followed by 4 weeks of engineering evaluations, and 4 weeks of human testing. Additional products will include a final report, poster presentation, and JTWG out-briefing that detail the innovative design and potential physiological benefits to astronauts as well as other scenarios requiring remote medical care such as military personnel or off-shore workers.</p>

<p>Following successful design, fabrication, and testing, this novel skin patch sensor will be shared with NASA&rsquo;s exploration medical team and MPCV design group.

The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an integrated system that will track physiological signals (heart rate and heart rate variability) and behavioral signals (sleep wake patterns) to detect chronic stress, hyperarousal, and insomnia during space missions. This project will deliver both the sensor hardware and signal processing software needed for the real-time data collection and integration with other behavioral health monitoring systems (e.g., Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool). The result of this project through Phase II will be a system that can be deployed in space analog environments for validation testing and ultimately deployed on ISS to assist astronauts and mission support personnel in the detection of astronaut chronic stress, hyperarousal, and insomnia. The critical need for an Individualized Stress Detection System has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP IRP Gap BMED3.

MSFC is a unique location where mature public health and meteorological expertise co-exists, positioning NASA to develop innovative capabilities that can aid public health officials in fighting disease outbreaks. Weather forecasts will drive the model. Prior weekly DV and ChikV case data will be used to re-parameterize the model so that the most up-to-date and relevant information informs the forecasts. Predictions will be evaluated against actual reported DF and ChikV case data.

We also propose to develop non-distorting X-ray reflective multilayer coatings for use above 80 keV. Our specific research objectives are: (a) develop two-dimensional control of film deposition and erosion to correct both low- and mid-frequency surface height errors in cylindrical, thin-shell mirror substrates, and (b) develop high-efficiency, non-distorting, zero net-stress, and stress balanced, reflective multilayer coatings for use above 80 keV.* [Ultrasound Fracture Diagnosis in Space](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yjsd-3znq) - This ground-based proposal accumulated high-level clinical evidence on the sensitivity and specificity of point of care ultrasound performed by expert and novice users for the rapid diagnosis of musculoskeletal injuries. This proposal developed preliminary educational methodologies to provide just-in-time training of novice users by creating multi-media training tools and imaging procedures for non expert operators. Expanded diagnostic use of ultrasound is being substantiated for the diagnosis of specific musculoskeletal injuries deemed possible in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and future exploration-class missions. This final report summarizes the sensitivity and specificity of non-expert performed musculoskeletal ultrasound to diagnose acute injuries.     
This Final Report covers Specific Aim I and II in the cooperative agreement:    
1. Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for bone fractures, associated muscle trauma, and fracture healing in a ground-based study at an academic medical center.    
EXPERT OPERATORS: We identified patients with potential musculoskeletal injuries in an urban, Level 1 trauma center based on mechanism of injury and the presenting complaint. Potential subjects were given a summary of the study and invited to participate following informed consent. A GE Logiq-e portable ultrasound device with a 12 MHz linear probe was used for the ultrasound investigations in this study.  The initial musculoskeletal (MSK) evaluations were performed and interpreted by ultrasound experts with extensive experience in MSK ultrasound. These examinations were also used to fashion cue cards and short video based educational aids to allow non-expert operators to perform complex ultrasound examinations for the later investigations in Specific Aim II.  The examinations confirmed earlier investigations at our institution which have demonstrated a very high sensitivity and specificity for ultrasound when performed with a portable ultrasound machine by an expert. There were no false positive examinations in this study. There was one false negative in a non displaced, sub-capital fracture of the hip in an obese patient. This patient also had a negative X-ray and was found to have a fracture on a subsequent MRI for continued pain.     
There were a number of additional soft tissue ultrasound examinations in this patient subgroup which showed soft tissue edema, hematoma formation, tendon-ligament tears, and foreign bodies.     
The analysis of this data set obtained and interpreted by MSK ultrasound experts suggests that  2D ultrasound provides a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of musculoskeletal trauma and that 3D or volumetric ultrasound is not necessary to obtain a correct diagnosis in experts' hands.     
NOVICE OPERATOR:    
Over 850 patients were screened for enrollment in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital. Initial patient screening was done by Trauma Surgery or Emergency Medicine staff based on mechanism of injury, history, and presenting signs and symptoms suggestive of significant musculoskeletal injury.     
Informed consent was obtained and a localized ultrasound examination was completed prior to radiographic evaluation by minimally trained personnel using a 10.5 MHz linear probe. The ultrasound examination was initially done on the contra lateral, non-injured side to obtain a reference image and to optimize visualization and focal zone. The entire length of the bone was visualized with special attention to the injured area. A positive scan consisted of identification of cortical disruption or discontinuity. Secondary hematomas and muscular injury were also recorded. Routine radiographic imaging was then completed for comparison against the ultrasound examination.    
Demographic, anatomic, and radiographic information was collected for correlation to the ultrasonographic findings. A diagnostic scoring sheet with patient and exam-specific data was filled out by the operator* [LBA-ECO LC-09 Soil Composition and Structure in the Brazilian Amazon: 1992-1995](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2vc5-6iuh) - This data set reports basic soil structure and composition information for five Amazonian research sites: Altamira, Bragantina, Tome-Acu, and Ponta de Pedras, all four in the state of Para, Brazil; and one site in Yapu, Colombia. Soil characteristics reported for all five study sites include cation information (e.g., H, Al, Mg, K, Na, S), percent of soil C, N, and organic matter, soil texture/composition and color, pH, and land use history. Soil bulk density and tons of carbon/ha are reported for only three of the study sites: Altamira, Bragantina, and Tome-Acu. All of the data are provided in one comma-separated data file.The five study areas represent characteristic differences in soil fertility and a range of land uses typical of the Amazon region. One of these areas, Altamira, is characterized by above average pH, nutrients, and texture. The other four areas are more typical of the 75 percent of the Amazon that is characterized by Oxisols and Ultisols, with well-drained but low pH and low levels of nutrients. Ponta de Pedras in Marajo Island, located in the estuary, is composed of upland Oxisols and floodplain alluvial soils. Igarape-Acu in the Bragantina region is characterized by both nutrient-poor Spodosols and Oxisols. Tome-Acu, south of Igarape-Acu, represents a mosaic of Oxisols and Ultisols. Yapu, in the Colombian Vaupes, is composed of patches of Spodosols and Oxisols. Three of the areas are colonization regions at various degrees of development: Altamira is a colonization front that opened up in 1971, whereas Tome-Acu was settled by a Japanese population in the 1930s, and Bragantina was settled in the early part of the twentieth century. Marajo (Ponta de Pedras) is the home of caboclos, whereas Yapu is home to Tukanoan Native American populations. In these study areas  slash-and-burn cultivation as well as plantation agriculture and mechanized agriculture are employed. Length of fallows vary in these communities. The two indigenous areas leave their land in longer fallow than do the three colonization areas, and the proportion of land prepared from secondary forests increases with length of settlement as the stock of mature forest declines over time.* [Contour Crafting Simulation Plan for Lunar Settlement Infrastructure Build-Up](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jgcr-f46h) - <p>Economically viable and reliable building systems and tool sets are being sought, examined, and tested for extraterrestrial habitat and infrastructure buildup. This proposal uses a unique architecture weaving an automated building technology called Contour Crafting (CC) with designs for assisting rapid buildup of an initial operational capability lunar base. Using CC technology, this proposal intends to draw up a detailed plan for a high-fidelity simulation at NASA's Desert Research and Technology Studies (D-RATS) facility, to construct certain crucial infrastructure elements in order to evaluate the merits, limitations, and feasibility of adapting and using the CC technology for extraterrestrial application. Elements suggested to be built and tested include roads, landing pads and aprons, shade walls, dust barriers, thermal and mm protection shields and dust-free platforms as well as other built-up structures utilizing the well known in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) strategy. Several unique systems including the Lunar Electric Rover, the unpressurized Chariot rover, the versatile light-weight crane, and Tri-Athlete cargo transporter as well as the habitat module mockups and a new generation of spacesuits are undergoing coordinated tests at NASA's D-RATS. This proposal intends to draw up a detailed synergetic plan to utilize these maturing systems coupled with the CC fabrication technology, tailored for swift and reliable lunar infrastructure development. This proposal intends to increase astronaut safety, improve buildup performance, ameliorate lunar dust interference and concerns, and attempts to reduce time-to-commission, all in an economic manner. As part of this proposal, a figure-of-merit methodology will be created and employed to gain some quantitative insight into the efficiency of using the CC technology to augment these other systems already in place.</p>* [Electrochemical Detection of Biological Catalysts as Signatures of Life](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f992-x33k) - The enzyme trypsin is chosen as a detection target due to its ubiquity in Earth biology. Trypsin catalyzes the break down of proteins through a catalytic triad consisting of histidine, aspartate and serine. The proposed sensor works by the detection of proteolytic cleavage of a redox-active tag. It is comprised of two gold electrodes. The first gold electrode houses a sensor probe, in this case a substrate peptide. The second electrode is a collector electrode that will detect the product of peptide cleavage. A methylene-labeled substrate peptide is self-assembled on a gold electrode using a thiol linkage. Any remaining accessible area of the electrode is then “blocked” or backfilled with an alkanethiol, which acts as an insulator and forces the peptide to stand up and form a close-packed structure on the gold surface. In this close-packed configuration, the peptide is accessible to the catalytic reaction with trypsin. Trypsin cleaves the peptide and releases the methylene blue terminus. A characteristic redox signature of methylene blue is detected at the second electrode using cyclic voltammetry and/or square wave voltammetry. Electrodes will be fabricated as 2 gold band electrodes on an inert substrate using a shadow mask and gold evaporation. While not required for proof of concept sensing, a simple fluidic channel will be added over the electrodes to demonstrate future integration ease with the ARC Universal Sample Processor for Life on Icy Worlds (SPLIce).* [Digital Array Gas Radiometer (DAGR), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6kdj-9vk6) - The innovation proposed here is a digital array gas radiometer (DAGR), a
new design for a gas filter correlation radiometer (GFCR) to accurately
measure and monitor CO2, CO, CH4, N2O and other key trace gases in the
boundary layer from space, aircraft or ground-based platforms. GFCR is a
well-known and proven technology for trace gas detection and monitoring.
However, its effectiveness in downlooking applications has been limited,
primarily because variations in surface albedo degrade the performance.
Our DAGR approach builds on traditional GFCR concepts and combines
several new key elements: two-dimensional detector arrays, pupil imaging
(imaging the aperture), and a novel calibration approach.  With these
enhancements and appropriate signal processing, the DAGR design
overcomes the historical limitations of GFCR in downlooking
applications.  In addition, this design significantly boosts the
sensitivity and expands the dynamic range traditionally available to
these sensors.  Finally, the innovation provides a calibration technique
that nearly eliminates errors due to detector drift effects.  The result

important boundary layer species from a variety of platforms.* [Ground-Based Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Cumulative Station Position Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/767v-9ehg) - Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Data (multi-day files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis to compute station position solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. The IDS Analysis Center Coordinator combines these individual AC solutions to generate a long-term DORIS position and velocity cumulative solution through a piecewise linear (position+velocity) model to describe the station motions. The cumulative position and velocity solution is obtained from the stacking of the weekly solution files and is then aligned to the current ITRF. The residuals of this stacking are of particular interest since they depict non-linear station motions. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/DORIS/DORIS_product_holdings.html.* [Monthly Climate Data for Selected USGS HCDN Sites, 1951-1990](https://data.nasa.gov/d/82eh-jb5c) - Time series of monthly minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were derived for 1337 watersheds in the conterminous United States for sites found in the national streamflow database, termed the hydroclimatologic data network (HCDN), developed by Slack et al. (1993a,b). Estimates were derived for the years 1951-1990.This HCDN data set consists of records of average daily streamflow at 1553 sites located throughout the United States. The data meet certain measurement accuracy criterion outlined by Slack et al. (1993). The HCDN contains river flows from 1874 to 1988, with an average record length of 44 years. The streamflow data included in the HCDN is purported to be relatively free from anthropogenic influences and the accuracy ratings of these records are at least rated good per USGS standards. A subset of the HCDN streamflow sites from 1337 watersheds with at least 10 years of record length was used. This subset includes 1376 HCDN sites.The climate characteristic estimates of temperature and precipitation were estimated using the PRISM (Daly et al. 1994, 1997) climate analysis system as described in Vogel, et al. 1999.Estimates of monthly potential evaporation were obtained using a method introduced by Hargreaves and Samani (1982) which is based on monthly time series of average minimum and maximum temperature data along with extraterrestrial solar radiation. Extraterrestrial solar radiation was estimated for each HCDN basin by computing the solar radiation over 0.1 degree grids using the method introduced by Duffie and Beckman (1980) and then summing those estimates for each river basin. This process is described in Sankarasubramanian, Vogel, and Limbrunner, 2001.The data files are organized in directories by parameter, Tmax, Tmin, Pre, and PET, and contain 18 subdirectories representing the 18 HCDN regions. Each region subdirectory contains data files for the monthly time series of respective hydroclimate attributes (Tmax, Tmin, Precipitation, and PET) for the individual HCDN sites in that region for the years 1951-1990. All files are in space delimited ASCII format.* [Fire Danger Assessment System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/998c-mrww) - <p>A fire danger dataset for the continental US based on satellite hydrology information, this can be updated monthly and used operationally to distribute fire response resources. &nbsp;The project involved working together with fire-community end-users and developing a data product that can be utilized for future NASA research solicitations in hydrology, disasters, and applied sciences programs, as well as other agency (e.g. NOAA) program solicitations.</p><p>Quantify fire-moisture relationships. &nbsp;At seasonal to annual time-scales, we will use the published relationships between sea surface temperatures and regional fire likelihood as a baseline predictor for a good or bad fire year [Chen et al., 2016], and extend this methodology to include terrestrial water storage information from GRACE. &nbsp;That long-term prediction will then be combined with a seasonal-to-monthly predictive approach based on surface moisture conditions [Rousseau et al., 2015]. &nbsp;We also will use GRACE-assimilated land surface model outputs of surface soil moisture (top 2.5 cm) at 12.5-km resolution in the continental US. &nbsp;At sub-seasonal time-scales (i.e. daily to monthly) we will use assimilated soil moisture and AIRS VPD to estimate future fire risk [e.g., Stavros et al., 2014]. &nbsp;The GFED4 fire occurrence and burned area database [Giglio et al., 2013], which has several significant improvements compared with earlierGFED versions, will be used with the predictor variables in a multi-regression approach that employs efficient parameterization. This results in a multi-variable algorithm for global seasonal/monthly/weekly fire danger. &nbsp;Two additional exploratory analyses will be undertaken if time permits: (i) Investigation of whether canopy and ground fuel moisture can be predicted using the SMAP vegetation water content product; (ii) Investigation of ECOSTRESS data usefulness and predictive viability. &nbsp;Both are subject to data quality and availability limitations. A remote sensing-based methodology for wall-to-wall fuel moisture levels would be extremely valuable to fire managers for optimizing suppression and firefighting resources.</p>* [Ground-Based Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Station Position Time Series Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7w6s-762z) - Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Data (multi-day files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

Recent technological advances in the developing field of wearable technologies has led to designs capable of measuring atmospheric conditions in addition to the more common physiological monitoring uses; however, these separate capabilities have not been packaged into a single monitoring system with real-time feedback.&nbsp; A conformable and flexible &quot;skin stamp&quot; instrumented with electronics and sensors to measure atmospheric conditions and physiological health during daily exercise, EVA, and exploration tasks would provide an easy to implement method to protect astronauts&rsquo; health and save cost and space during all phases of the Journey to Mars. Additionally, advancement of this technology could be used to immediately enhance ISS medical monitoring capabilities and in other isolated environments such as military training and off shore rigging.</p>
 <p>Advancing human exploration beyond low earth orbit and ISS will require improved and more autnomous health monitoring systems, highlighting the importance of integrating multiple medical devices in one platform with focus on early detection of remediable conditions. Skin-mounted biosensors provide the capability to monitor indicators of physical performance and fatigue (i.e. heart rate, hydration, temperature, oxygen saturation).&nbsp; NASA exploration needs requirements doucment specfically calls out&nbsp;capabilities for environmental monitoring to quickly detect changes that could result in an unfavorable habitation. As an example,&nbsp;daily exercise sessions may stress the Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) Systems on exploration vehicles due to heat generation, sweat production, and carbon dioxide accumulation. Accordingly, there is a need to develop sensors that can simultaneously monitor physiological health and atmospheric conditions (i.e. temperature, humidity, gas concentrations) during Mars proving-ground and Earth-Independent missions. The proposed wearable &ldquo;skin stamp&rdquo; multi-parametric sensor will be a novel design with dual-use technology in mind to monitor both biomedical and atmospheric conditions in a single platform</p>

<p>The proposed &quot;skin stamp&quot; sensor will be designed, fabricated, and tested as a collaborative effort between SK and University of Houston Engineering Department. The teams expertise in sensor and materials design, physiological monitoring and testing, and exploration are necessary to successfully develop a suite of sensors in a single platform that is optimized for exploration within the budget and time constraints of this ICA. We propose to strategically assemble a suite of atmospheric and physiological monitoring sensors in a conformable skin mounted fabric and integrate key design features including ease of use, single platform, high data quality, durability, and real-time monitoring. We will leverage previous high-performance flexible electronic material assemblies developed by UH. The hardware will undergo rigorous evaluations at different environmental temperatures.</p>

<p>The product of this effort will be a novel prototype multi-sensor skin patch that allows for accurate, real-time physiological and atmospheric monitoring in a single platform design. The first 8 weeks will focus on sensor development, followed by 4 weeks of engineering evaluations, and 4 weeks of human testing. Additional products will include a final report, poster presentation, and JTWG out-briefing that detail the innovative design and potential physiological benefits to astronauts as well as other scenarios requiring remote medical care such as military personnel or off-shore workers.</p>

<p>Following successful design, fabrication, and testing, this novel skin patch sensor will be shared with NASA&rsquo;s exploration medical team and MPCV design group. Additional funding will be sought via IR* [Individualized Stress Detection System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/t8xw-fiua) - Given the extended duration of future missions and the isolated, extreme and confined environments, there is the possibility that stress-related behavioral conditions and mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) will develop. The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an integrated system that will track physiological signals (heart rate and heart rate variability) and behavioral signals (sleep wake patterns) to detect chronic stress, hyperarousal, and insomnia during space missions. This project will deliver both the sensor hardware and signal processing software needed for the real-time data collection and integration with other behavioral health monitoring systems (e.g., Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool). The result of this project through Phase II will be a system that can be deployed in space analog environments for validation testing and ultimately deployed on ISS to assist astronauts and mission support personnel in the detection of astronaut chronic stress, hyperarousal, and insomnia. The critical need for an Individualized Stress Detection System has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP IRP Gap BMED3. During Phase I, we will perform an assessment of heart rate sensor and actigraphy technologies and develop engineering requirements and detailed technical plans to be implemented during Phase II (Phase I TRL of 3).* [Meteorologically Driven Dengue and Chikungunya Forecasts](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hjc4-hnk6) - The goal of this project is to incorporate weather forecasts and reported DF and ChikV case data into a disease transmission model to forecast disease case numbers in Caribbean countries. MSFC is a unique location where mature public health and meteorological expertise co-exists, positioning NASA to develop innovative capabilities that can aid public health officials in fighting disease outbreaks. Weather forecasts will drive the model. Prior weekly DV and ChikV case data will be used to re-parameterize the model so that the most up-to-date and relevant information informs the forecasts. Predictions will be evaluated against actual reported DF and ChikV case data. This project will produce a prototype for an innovative disease forecast system for use by public health agencies and officials.* [JAWS: Justified AWS-like data through workflow enhancements that ease access and add scientific value](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qckz-tpbc) - Automated Weather Station and AWS-like networks are the primary source of surface-level meteorological data in remote polar regions. These networks have developed organically and independently, and deliver data to researchers in idiosyncratic ASCII formats that hinder automated processing and intercomparison among networks. Moreover, station tilt causes significant biases in polar AWS measurements of radiation and wind direction. Researchers, network operators, and data centers would benefit from AWS-like data in a common format, amenable to automated analysis, and adjusted for known biases. This project addresses these needs by developing a scientific software workflow called "Justified AWS" (JAWS) to ingest Level 2 (L2) data in the multiple formats now distributed, harmonize it into a common format, and deliver value-added Level 3 (L3) output suitable for distribution by the network operator, analysis by the researcher, and curation by the data center. 
Polar climate researchers currently face daunting problems including how to easily: 1. Automate analysis  (subsetting, statistics, unit conversion) of AWS-like L2 ASCII data. 2. Combine or intercompare data and data quality from among unharmonized L2 datasets. 3. Adjust L2 data for biases such as AWS tilt angle and direction. JAWS addresses these common issues by harmonizing AWS L2 data into a common format, and applying accepted methods to quantify quality and estimate biases. Specifically, JAWS enables users and network operators to 1. Convert L2 data (usually ASCII tables) into a netCDF-based L3 format compliant with metadata conventions (Climate-Forecast and ACDD) that promote automated discovery and analysis. 2. Include value-added L3 features like the Retrospective, Iterative, Geometry-Based (RIGB) tilt angle and direction corrections, solar angles, and standardized quality flags. 3. Provide a scriptable API to extend the initial L2-to-L3 conversion to newer AWS-like networks and instruments. Polar AWS network experts and NSIDC DAAC personnel, each with decades of experience, will help guide and deliberate the L3 conventions implemented in Stages 2-3.
The project will start on July 1, 2017 at entry Technology Readiness Level 3 and will exit on June 30, 2019 at TRL 6. JAWS is now a heterogeneous collection of scripts and methods developed and validated at UCI over the past 15 years. At exit, JAWS will comprise three modular stages written in or wrapped by Python, installable by Conda: Stage 1 ingests and translates L2 data into netCDF. Stage 2 annotates the netCDF with CF and ACDD metadata. Stage 3 derives value-added scientific and quality information. The labor-intensive tasks include turning our heterogeneous workflow into a robust, standards-compliant, extensible workflow with an API based on best practices of modern scientific information systems and services. Implementation of Stages 1-2 may be straightforward though tedious due to the menagerie of L2 formats, instruments, and assumptions. The RIGB component of Stage 3 requires ongoing assimilation of ancillary NASA data (CERES, AIRS) and use of automated data transfer protocols (DAP, THREDDS).
The immediate target recipient elements are polar AWS network managers, users, and data distributors. L2 borehole data suffers from similar interoperability issues, as does non-polar AWS data. Hence our L3 format will be extensible to global AWS and permafrost networks. JAWS will increase in situ data accessibility and utility, and enable new derived products (both are AIST goals). The PI is a long-standing researcher, open source software developer, and educator who understands obstacles to harmonizing disparate datasets with NASA interoperability recommendations. Our team participates in relevant geoscience communities, including ESDS working groups, ESIP, AGU, and EarthCube.* [Microbiological Quality and Food Safety of Plants Grown on ISS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/r8xg-fbm2) - <p>A challenge for growing fresh foods (vegetables) in space is demonstrating that they are safe for consumption according to NASA microbiological standards set for food. The goal of this project is to select and advance methods to enable real-time sampling, microbiological analysis, and sanitation of crops grown on the &nbsp;International Space Station (ISS). These methods would validate the microbiological quality of crops grown for consumption to ensure safe and palatable fresh foods. This will be achieved through the development / advancement of microbiological sample collection, rapid pathogen detection, and effective sanitation methods that are compatible with a microgravity environment.</p> <p>This project aligns with current plans for deployment of a vegetable production unit on the International Space Station (Veggie) and the procurement and evaluation of platforms (RAZOR) at Kennedy Space Center for rapid microbial monitoring on ISS.</p><p>A 3-step approach is being used to evaluate and modify methods for analyzing fresh produce (fresh vegetables / fruits) that would be compatible with a microgravity environment. Candidate food crops are being grown in a controlled environment chamber for the following tests:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Assessment of sampling procedures for surfaces of edible plant material to gather meaningful microbiological data. The three sample methods are surface swabbing, the use of adhesive tape to collect surface microbes and a blender method to remove microbes from plant tissue.

The other two methods have been tested as portable real-time methods to collect samples from the surfaces of meat as well as produce including tomato fruit and leafy greens</li><li>Analysis of samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), arabidopsis thaliana peroxidases (ATP) analysis, and culture based methods for enumeration as well as identification of target organisms with an emphasis on approaches that yield rapid results. The methods employed are all commercially available technologies. Our goal is to reduce detection time with the constraints of methodology that could practically be used on the ISS for sample analysis.</li><li>Comparison of sanitizing and disinfection procedures for the vegetables and plant growth unit surfaces, including methods developed and tested in the AES Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU). The focus is on the development of a sanitizing wipe that can be used on plant growth systems such as Veggie as well as edible plant surfaces to reduce the microbial load. The sanitizer being used is a citric acid based food grade sanitizer (Pro-San<sup>&reg;</sup>). This sanitizer has been tested previously and has been shown to be effective in the sanitization of edible vegetables.</li></ol><p><strong>Progress</strong></p><p>A series of experiments has been completed using three different sampling procedures, swabbing, adhesive tape collection and sample blending for the recovery of bacteria from the surface of radish, tomato and lettuce. Data collected and analyzed to date show no significant difference using culture based detection methods between the adhesive tape and bag blender sample methods in the recovery of <em>Salmonella enterica</em> Typhimurium, a human associated food borne pathogen inoculated onto the surface of lettuce, tomato, and radish. The swab method recovery was significantly lower then the other two methods in the case of lettuce and radish. With the samples collected by these different sampling procedures we are comparing detection and quantification methods, specifically real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) using two platforms, the LightCycler&reg; (Roche Diagnostics) and a rapid portable system, the RAZOR (Biofire, Salt Lake City, UT) with conventional culture based methods. For these tests we used <em>S. enterica </em>Typhimurium and <em>Eshcerichia coli</em> K12 inoculated onto the surface* [The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Genomes (SETG)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tngt-vgkw) - <p>Background: Widespread synthesis of complex organics, including nucleobases and ribose precursors, occurred early in the history of the solar system in the solar nebula. These organics, delivered by comets and meteorites to multiple potentially habitable zones (Earth, Mars, Enceladus, Europa, Titan) may have biased the evolution of life towards utilization of similar informational polymers. Meteoritic exchange might also have produced shared ancestry, most plausible for Earth and Mars. We propose to continue development of the ASTID-funded Search for Extra-Terrestrial Genomes (SETG), a life detection instrument for in-situ sequencing of nucleic acids. Science Goals: Our mission focus area is astrobiology and the search for life beyond Earth. Our science goal for Mars is to search for related or unrelated nucleic acid-based life, particularly life that has the potential to interact with life on Earth; this may also inform sample selection for Mars Sample Return (MSR) and reduce the risks of false positives through the first in-situ measurement of forward contamination. Our science goal for Enceladus is to search for a second genesis based on nucleic acids in the plumes emanating from the South Polar Region. Life detection may also be possible in Europa orbit but the availability of a suitable plume is tenuous and it is a challenge for biological reagents to survive intense radiation there. Objectives: The objectives of this proposal are to 1) advance SETG component/subsystem development through validation in lab and relevant environments, 2) integrate instrument components into a single automated end-to-end system, and 3) assess and validate instrument performance and limits of detection (expected to be ppb or better) using synthetic and environmental samples, including operation under Mars temperature and pressure. Methodology: We will apply advances in nucleic acid extraction and concentration to enable high-yield isolation of high-purity nucleic acids, followed by nanopore-based detection and single-molecule sequencing-by-synthesis. This effort will include stabilization of all reagents. B. subtilis spores will be used to validate detection limits down to 50 spores, with testing to 10 spores. To further assess system performance, we will use other synthetic and environmental samples, carry out bench top and field validation, and operation under Mars-like temperature and pressure conditions; this will advance SETG from TRL 3 to TRL 6 in preparation for future flight definition. Relevance: SETG addresses the NASA Science Plan question &#39;How did life begin and evolve on Earth and has it evolved elsewhere in the solar system?&#39; and the corresponding objective to &#39;Identify and investigate past or present habitable environments on Mars and other worlds, and determine if there is or has ever been life elsewhere in the solar system.&#39; Our effort is responsive to Decadal Survey priorities, including Mars Sample Return, Europa Orbiter, and the moderate-priority Enceladus orbiter. Why MATISSE? First, SETG requires substantial additional development and validation before flight definition, and addresses the specified TRL range. Second, our effort will help to provide heritage for a new class of instruments that utilize biological components to enable a range of new capabilities at extremely low power, mass, and volume. Third, we cannot envision a discovery that would be higher payoff than the indisputable identification of life beyond Earth, which SETG is uniquely positioned to do. Finally, SETG also has significant Earth applications ranging from environmental monitoring to clinical diagnosis.</p>* [Cloud-Based Social Media Visual Analytics Disaster Response System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pnda-zj57) - We propose a next-generation cloud-based social media visual analytics disaster response system that will enable decision-makers and first-responders to obtain real-time analytics (both descriptive and predictive) for situational awareness and early-warning. Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook provide rapid "sensory" feedback from "human sensors" &#150; the millions of people on the ground including those affected by the disaster as well as hundreds of first-responders and relief organizations. The problem is that this social media data can be overwhelming and noisy (lots of irrelevant stuff). Our proposed innovation is to combine and analyze this social media unstructured "big-data", together with other structured data from a variety of sources including NASA. The emphasis is on visual analytics which will allow all these diverse geospatial data to be integrated and analyzed on a real-time basis in an intuitive manner. We utilize geobrowsers such as COAST, Google Earth, and OpenStreetMap for display of the output of the visual analytics prediction system. This is an interactive system which enables the relevant users and decision-makers to provide input to the analytics process as the solution evolves.* [Global Landslide Data - Export - Visual Explorer](https://data.nasa.gov/view/angv-aquq) - <div>The Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was developed with the goal of identifying rainfall-triggered landslide events around the world, regardless of size, impacts or location.

The result of Phase II will be a system that can be deployed in space analog environments for validation testing and ultimately deployed on ISS to assist astronauts and mission support personnel in the detection of astronaut chronic stress, hyperarousal, and insomnia. The critical need for an Individualized Stress Detection System has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP IRP Gap BMED2. The Technology Readiness Level at the end of Phase II will be TRL 5.* [The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development.](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rp24-jkbu) - Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development and has been proposed as a gravisensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days. Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins chemokines IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules. Importantly 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity. Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs. Total RNA samples extracted from Pthrp+/+and -/- trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) exposed for 6 days to simulated 0g in Synthecon rotating cell or left 6 days in culture at 1g. Cells had either been treated with a pulsatile treatment (2 h/day) of PTHrP1-36 peptide (10-8M) or received a change in growth medium. In total: 8 different conditions with 2 replicates each i.e. Pthrp+/+ TOs at 0g or 1g with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment and Pthrp-/- TOs at 0g or 1 g,with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment.* [Online Detection, Isolation, and Remediation of Flight Software Faults, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kre6-ry4f) - Increasingly, critical flight functionality is implemented in software, but traditional (integrated) vehicle health management (IVHM) has primarily addressed hardware faults. All fielded software has residual errors, and the marginal costs to remove errors grow as the target residual error rate decreases. Our innovation is the development of tools, architectural concepts and software development methodologies to extend IVHM systems to detect, isolate and recover from software errors, as a cost effective way to increase the reliability and robustness of flight software. Software fault detection, isolation and recovery (SFDIR) fixes or contains the impact of faults and reduces the possibility of catastrophic loss.  Each phase ? detection, isolation, and recovery ? raises new research challenges. This work addresses automated diagnostics of mission-critical avionics and middleware or software toolkits to lower the cost of developing online health monitoring applications. Our technical objectives are to detect, by code instrumentation, when the software state violates explicated safety constraints; using model-based reasoning and program analysis techniques, to trace from symptom to error source; and to recover from errors in a safe way preserving or replacing as much functionality as possible, and in all cases "to do no harm". This technology may also be applied to monitor potential security threats.* [Global Gridded Geographically Based Economic Data (G-Econ), Version 4](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y7sx-uaxy) - The Global Gridded Geographically Based Economic Data (G-Econ), Version 4 contains derived one degree grid cells of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data in GRID and ASCII formats for both Market Exchange Rate (MER) and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) for the years 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. MER is the exchange rate between local and U.S. dollar currencies for a given time period established by the market. PPP is the exchange rate between a country's currency and U.S. dollars adjusted to reflect the actual cost in U.S. dollars of purchasing a standardized market basket of goods in that country using the country's currency. The original data from the G-Econ Project at Yale University is also available in tabular format and includes latitude and longitude geographic coordinates of the grid cells, area of grid cells, as well as country names, distance to coast, elevation, vegetation, population, precipitation and temperature.* [A Synthetic Biology Architecture to Detoxify and Enrich Mars Soil for Agriculture](https://data.nasa.gov/d/itf7-xpxy) - Although the theoretical case for space biological engineering is convincing, since recent studies on the use of biology in space showed substantial payload minimization over abiotic approaches even before any engineering, the functioning of these biological technologies has yet to be proven in a space-like environment. We will study such functioning for a synthetic biology architecture that can detoxify the perchlorate in Mars soil and also enrich it with ammonia. Our work will inform a prime deliverable of a comparative assessment with alternate chemical approaches postulated or scoped by NASA, and will clarify the feasibility of utilizing our proposed biotechnology to support manned Mars missions. The two system processes of perchlorate reduction and nitrogen fixation individually exist in biology and, when combined, will potentiate soil-based agriculture (by plants or microbes) on Mars. Our concept architecture is a single model organism that will eventually have both systems that are now separate in different strains of the same species. The advantages of our proposed architecture over current approaches, such as washing out perchlorate to cleanse soil or using hydroponics to grow plants, include a low initialization mass of microbial cells, on- demand cell growth with in situ resources, and the elimination of toxic wastewater. To accomplish our proposed concept architecture, we will investigate two strains of a diverse clade of organisms, Pseudomonas, which includes relevant extremophiles. Pseudomonas stutzeri PDA is a perchlorate reducer that we have previously studied using a method that examines the fitness profiles of organism mutants in several environment conditions to obtain genetic determinants of fitness. Pseudomonas stutzeri is also capable of nitrogen fixation (e.g. strain A1501). Pseudomonas has two advantages that make experiments with it more practical than with other space synthetic biology possibilities like photosynthetic, extremophile cyanobacteria: the use of the same host cloning vectors as the model laboratory organism Escherichia coli, and a doubling time of an hour, which is much faster than seven hours for a model non-extremophile cyanobacterium and four days for a model extremophile cyanobacterium. We will test an environmentally-relevant Pseudomonas host that, in follow-on work, we expect to refactor for efficient expression, operation, and interfacing to different hosts including Pseudomonad extremophiles, cyanobacteria, and other mission possibilities. Here, we will map perchlorate reduction and nitrogen fixation performance to host physiology and environment variables. Since we have already developed a microbial growth chamber that can apply environment parameters over Mars-relevant ranges, e.g., pressure from 10 kPa, temperature from -60 degrees C to 40 degrees C, light intensities up to 25 klx, UV radiation, and a 95%-3% carbon dioxide-nitrogen atmosphere, we will study how strains PDA and A1501 perform in increasingly Mars-like conditions, and what genetic mechanisms mediate survival, growth and activities in these conditions. By controllably exploring functionality, we will map the most extreme conditions in which our mesophile can survive, grow and perform. We will then identify limitations on these activities, and derive targets for future individual and joint optimization of system operation in parameter ranges that are more like Mars. Our work will enable a techno-economic analysis of performance versus output-generation time, input/nutrient mass needs, necessity of alternate chemical approaches, etc. Our concept will achieve the “promising potential” of biological technologies, identified in the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap TA 7 as “deserve[ing] sine attention.” Broader impacts include Earth-based bioremediation (e.g., land cleanup near oil wells and toxic spills) and non-arable land enrichment to improve food production to address famines, drought, larger populations, etc.* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jc5t-749b) - The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. FASIR-NDVI data are also used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface. There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.* [Towards Efficient Viscous Modeling Based on Cartesian Methods for Automated Flow Simulation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kjxx-ai8x) - The proposed work aims at developing techniques that will address the
current limitations of Cartesian-based Navier-Stokes CFD schemes by
exploring three promising methods of implementing improved wall boundary
conditions. The three methods are based on: (1) the diamond stencil
approach of Delanaye et al., (2) the extrapolation boundary condition
work by Marshall and Ruffin, and (3) the Material Point Method developed
by Advanced Dynamics. The knowledge gained from prototype
implementations of these schemes will lead to the development of an
efficient viscous modeling algorithm suitable to general Cartesian CFD
codes at the end of Phase I. Phase II will integrate this algorithm into
a large-scale Cartesian CFD code in consultation with NASA technical
representative. Phase III will commercialize the resulting techniques to
be developed in Phases I and II and demonstrate their applicability to a
wide range of problems.* [Standardized 'Pre-flight' Exercise Tests to Predict Performance during Extravehicular Activities in a Lunar Environment Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kvaq-63x8) - &lt;p&gt;Several manuscripts have been submitted or are in final preparation for submission from the Phase I data. Phase II has been completed, with a total of 12 subjects finishing the protocol. Each subject attempted to complete 9 laps of our obstacle course at two different paces; one representing the average pace of the Apollo astronauts during lunar EVAs (VO2 of ~20 ml/kg/min) and one at an estimated suited Martian cost of 30 ml/kg/min. All subjects were able to complete the course at the Lunar pace. However, at the Martian pace, 5 of the 12 subjects failed ~ lap 5. Subjects who completed the Martian pace had a VO2max on average of 44.3 &amp;plusmn; 5.0 ml/kg/min, while the 5 who failed (3 men, 2 women) had a VO2max of 36.8 &amp;plusmn; 2.9 ml/kg/min. Further, the Martian pace was likely at or above the critical speed of the subjects who failed. EMG and Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) signals differed by pace, but were not different between those who successfully completed both paces and those who failed at the Martian pace. Initial analysis of EMG and NIRS data failed to find any differences in the responses between those that failed and those that successfully completed the 9 laps. These results are being written up for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the hoist suspension system is operational to the point of being able to conduct pilot experiments. We have acquired preliminary VO2 responses during ambulation at 3 mph under 1-g, Martian (3/8-g), and Lunar (1/6-g) offloading. In addition, during the Lunar offloading, subjects naturally and unconsciously assumed an almost skipping stride pattern, very similar to that adopted by the Apollo astronauts during lunar EVAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;* [NONA Repair of Composite Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ib7j-quvs) - While much attention is necessarily focused on the evaluation and certification of the materials and processes involved in adhesive bonding, development is still needed in decreasing the cost, time, and complexity of the current repair concepts. A material and processing system is needed that allows the design, infusion, and cure of composite repairs without the current roadblocks imposed by ovens, autoclaves, and expensive tooling. VARTM processing of custom repairs allows freedom in design and minimizes the specialized tooling required for patches and straps that are prefabricated apart from the structures needing repair. CRG's no-oven, no-autoclave (NONA) composite processing technology enables the fabrication of high-performance composite parts without the limitations imposed by autoclaves and ovens. NASA originally funded CRG to develop the materials and processes for the manufacture of large, single-piece space launch structures. Building on that activity, CRG proposes NONA repair of composite structures. In this concept, NONA resin is introduced to a scarfed surface and dry fiber via VARTM processing and undergoes complete cure without additional heat input. NONA offers the opportunity to repair PMC structures on-site without the use of large capital equipment. The University of Dayton Research Institute will conduct the scarfing and evaluation of test materials. The resin consists of common aerospace epoxy components, but it is formulated to achieve complete cure in a matter of hours without additional heat input. The two-part epoxy system uses its own chemical energy to propel itself through a complete cure.  It provides good strength, chemical resistance, and thermal performance up to 350 deg. F. CRG envisions a mobile fleet of NONA composite technicians that can perform repair activities at manufacturing sites around the world, restoring functionality to damaged structures and tools, minimizing impact on plant operations and production.* [Global Annual Average PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i7t3-dqnp) - Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data sets represent a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data. Together the grids provide a continuous surface of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. The satellite AOD retrievals were converted to ground-level concentrations based on a conversion factor developed by researchers at Dalhousie University that accounts for spatial and temporal variations in aerosol properties and vertical structure as derived from a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 30 arc-minutes (0.5 degree or approximately 50 sq. km at the equator) and cover the world from 70°N to 60°S latitude. The grids were produced by researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute in collaboration with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network/Columbia University under a NASA-ROSES project entitled "Using Satellite Data to Develop Environmental Indicators: An Application of NASA Data Products to Support High Level Decisions for National and International Environmental Protection". Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature death as well as increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease, especially in the elderly, young children, and those already suffering from these illnesses. The World Health Organization guideline for PM2.5 average annual exposure is less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms per cubic meter, whereas the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) primary standard is less than or equal to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA primary standards are designed to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.* [Physical Modeling for Anomaly Diagnostics and Prognostics, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/db8i-z2d6) - Ridgetop developed an innovative, model-driven anomaly diagnostic and fault characterization system for electromechanical actuator (EMA) systems to mitigate catastrophic failures. 
Ridgetop developed a MIL-STD-1553 bus monitor and a MIL-STD-1553 bus controller that simulates the aircraft data bus, reads the environmental (i.e., altitude) and operational (i.e., response of system) data of a system and determines if a fault is manifesting; and if true determines the root cause and symptoms of the fault. Once an anomaly is detected, the Model-based Avionic Prognostic Reasoner (MAPR) solves a user-outlined state-space model, symbolically, using a Gauss-Newton optimization method and the information from the MIL-STD-1553 bus. This algorithm outputs a list of best fitting parameters to match the command to the actual performance. Rules are programmed in, based on results from principal component analysis . The rules determine both fault mode and the severity of that fault. The rules can distinguish between two failure modes: Mechanical jam and MOSFET failure, and healthy.
The real-time processing will allow for critical evolutions in flight safety and provides a game-changing approach to condition-based maintenance. Once  deployed, flight safety can be improved by allowing the on-board flight computers to read from the MAPR and update their control envelope based on its evaluations, reducing damage propagation and increasing operational safety. 
In Phase 2, we will develop a functioning ground-based prototype of the technology to show the efficacy of the method. A ground-based version of the tool is the best candidate for development to ease adoption by testing in a low-risk environment; this tool will be demonstrated at the end of Phase 2. The MAPR concept is also applicable to any system with a state-space representation but at this point it has been developed with EMAs in mind. 
The MAPR prototype is at TRL 5 and will reach a TRL 7 by the end of Phase 2.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Biodiversity](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9mfy-wzq5) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Biodiversity provides data and information on amphibians, disease agents (extent and distribution of infectious and parasitic diseases), drylands (cattle, sheep and goats, and pasture), islands (fishing pressure, sewage pollution index and tourism), loss of natural land cover (biomes and realms), polar population, species distribution models, and terrestrial ecoregions and realms. Biodiversity is defined as the variability among living organisms from all sources, including terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are a part. The original information was received from multiple sources that include the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, formerly the World Conservation Union), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) of Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on-board NASA satellites Terra and Aqua. Through the Convention on Biological Diversity, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, and the Convention on Migratory Species, the data were also designed to meet the needs of stakeholders in the business, civil and native communities.* [Decadal Variations in NDVI and Food Production in India](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hbap-xs3e) - In this study we use long-term satellite, climate, and crop observations to document the spatial distribution of the recent stagnation in food grain production affecting the water-limited tropics (WLT), a region where 1.5 billion people live and depend on local agriculture that is constrained by chronic water shortages. Overall, our analysis shows that the recent stagnation in food production is corroborated by satellite data. The growth rate in annually integrated vegetation greenness, a measure of crop growth, has declined significantly (p < 0.10) in 23% of the WLT cropland area during the last decade, while statistically significant increases in the growth rates account for less than 2%. In most countries, the decade-long declines appear to be primarily due to unsustainable crop management practices rather than climate alone. One quarter of the statistically significant declines are observed in India, which with the world’s largest population of food-insecure people and largest WLT croplands, is a leading example of the observed declines. Here we show geographically matching patterns of enhanced crop production and irrigation expansion with groundwater that have leveled off in the past decade. We estimate that, in the absence of irrigation, the enhancement in dry-season food grain production in India, during 1982–2002, would have required an increase in annual rainfall of at least 30% over almost half of the cropland area. This suggests that the past expansion of use of irrigation has not been sustainable. We expect that improved surface and groundwater management practices will be required to reverse the recent food grain production declines.

The grids have a resolution of 30 arc-seconds (0.0083 decimal degrees), or approximately 1 square km. The gridded variables are based on census block   geography from Census 2000 TIGER/Line Files and census variables (income, poverty, education, housing age). This dataset is produced by the Columbia University Center for International   Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Predictive Condition-Based Maintenance for Vertical Lift Vehicles, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bw7t-fjgd) - NASA has invested significant effort in the past decade in developing and maturing technologies that enable efficient and effective use of Next-generation (NextGen) Vertical Lift (VL) systems for a broad class of missions and operations. One of the key barriers it faces to the widespread use of VL vehicles within the National Airspace is the cost of maintenance on the vehicles to keep them safe and reliable. Qualtech Systems, Inc (QSI) in collaboration with Lockheed Martin - Mission Systems and Training (LM-MST) seeks to address these maintenance challenges by fielding a predictive Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) solution leveraging a diagnostic reasoner TEAMS-RDS (Testability Engineering And Maintenance System Remote Diagnosis Server) and prognostic algorithms. CBM+ involves inferring, tracking and forecasting of system degradation based on state awareness acquired from monitored data through fault detection, isolation, identification, diagnosis and prognosis techniques and to proactively plan maintenance actions to improve system availability and safety. QSI-LM's CBM+ solution will furnish the ability to keep the vehicle health status continually ahead of an advancing failure accumulation through a predictive maintenance strategy geared towards replacement-while-in-operation before the ensuing failures render the VL vehicle inoperable. Diagnosis will focus on current health state identification through detection, isolation, root cause analysis and identification of faults that have already occurred, while prognosis will leverage the current health state identification and forecast performance degradation, incipient component failures and probability density (or moments) of remaining useful life (RUL) or Time to Maintenance (TTM) or Time to Failure (TTF). It is anticipated that the CBM+ solution will leverage the currently existing communication capabilities between the aircraft, the pilot and ground-support personnel in a seamless and automated manner.* [Data Reduction Techniques for Real-time Fault Detection and Diagnosis, and Multiple Fault Inference with Imperfect Tests, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4dv5-yaky) - The recent advances in data collection and storage capabilities have led to information overload in many applications, including on-line monitoring of spacecraft operations with time series data. Such datasets present new challenges in data analysis, especially for implementation in memory-constrained DECUs.  Also, the traditional statistical methods break down partly because of the increase in the number of observations (measurements), but mostly due to an increase in the number of variables associated with each observation ("dimension of the data"). One of the problems with high-dimensional datasets is that not all the measured variables are "important" for understanding the underlying phenomena of interest. In addition to the computational cost, irrelevant features may also cause a reduction in the accuracy of some algorithms.  The first key issue we propose to address is that of data reduction techniques for onboard implementation of data-driven classification techniques in memory-constrained onboard processing units. Some of the classification techniques we intend to use with the above data-reduction techniques include, support vector machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), principal component Bayesian analysis (PCA). To improve the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of the above classifiers, we will apply classifier fusion techniques such as AdaBoost, Error correcting output codes, Voting to find which architecture will enhance the accuracy and under what conditions. Finally we will investigate Dynamic Multiple Fault Diagnosis that can work with imperfect fault/anomaly detection tests. As part of this task, we will develop novel factorial hidden Markov model-based inferencing techniques such as Lagrangian relaxation and Viterbi decoding algorithms to solve this difficult combinatorial optimization problem, for on-board vehicle health monitoring and fault diagnosis.* [Laser transmitter for space-based water vapor lidar](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kdvm-vmpf) - Water vapor (WV) lies at the heart of most key atmospheric processes. Humidity is essential for the development of severe weather, it influences, directly and indirectly through cloud formation, the planetary radiative balance, and it influences atmospheric dynamics, surface fluxes and soil moisture. Despite its central importance, research to date has not led to a universally accepted picture of the factors controlling WV amount, a solid understanding of the mechanisms by which it influences atmospheric processes, or even precise knowledge of its concentrations in many parts of the atmosphere.
 
A future satellite-based WV Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) would revolutionize weather and climate research by providing high-resolution and accurate WV profiles with global coverage. Passive microwave and IR measurements are the backbone of weather and climate research but have significant limitations. Passive measurements are weighted toward the upper troposphere and hence have very little sensitivity near the surface where the majority of WV and its largest spatial and temporal gradients reside. Passive sounders also suffer from coarse vertical resolution and unknown biases resulting from aerosol and cloud contamination. The DIAL approach is self-calibrating, and its measurement uncertainties can be precisely quantified and traded by adapting the spatial resolution to the defined scientific objective. Furthermore, the DIAL approach can overcome one of the largest shortcomings of current passive measurements by adjusting the measurement sensitivity to near-surface atmosphere to capture the moisture variability above and through the boundary layer, in the presence of intervening cloud and aerosol layers in order to improve our understanding of fundamental mechanisms driving convection and cloud microphysics.

Conventional WV DIAL lasers are inadequate for space-based operation as they are inefficient, complex, and have low average power, which limits precision and spatial resolution. We propose to build a WV DIAL laser transmitter to enable WV DIAL measurements throughout the troposphere from a space-based platform. The transmitter will probe an atmospheric WV absorption line near 816 nm, allowing for profile measurements of WV number density using the DIAL technique, and aerosol and cloud profiles using the backscatter lidar approach.  As part of this effort, we will advance the TRL of the laser transmitter to lower the development time, risk, and cost of a future WV DIAL satellite instrument.
The proposed laser will utilize thulium-based solid-state laser crystals, which offer the prospect of greatly improved efficiency, simplicity, and average-power scalability compared to conventional methods. Recent proof-of-principle demonstrations of Tm:LiYF4 (YLF) lasers highlight the promise of the proposed approach, provide laser physics understanding, and set a clear development path. The objective of this proposal is to develop Tm:YLF lasers with the energy per pulse (≥100 mJ), average power (≥10 W, 50 Hz double pulsed), efficiency (≥5%), and spectral control (≥ 99.9% spectral purity) needed for a space-based WV DIAL. The period of performance for the proposed effort is 3 years. Years 1 and 2 will focus on risk reduction where critical performance metrics will be demonstrated on a bench top breadboard. In year 3 we will design and build a brassboard laser compatible with the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) WV DIAL, High Altitude Lidar Observatory (HALO). We exit the program with a brassboard laser that has the performance of a space-based WV DIAL system and will be validated using HALO in a follow-on effort from high-altitude aircraft as a stepping stone to space. This technology has entry TRL-2 and a planned TRL-4 exit with a clear path to TRL-5 in a follow-on program by incorporation of the brassboard laser into HALO.* [Global Landslide Catalog Export](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rthp-tcrg) - The Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was developed with the goal of identifying rainfall-triggered landslide events around the world, regardless of size, impacts or location. The GLC considers all types of mass movements triggered by rainfall, which have been reported in the media, disaster databases, scientific reports, or other sources. The GLC has been compiled since 2007 at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This is a unique data set with the ID tag “GLC” in the landslide editor. This dataset on data.nasa.gov was a one-time export from the Global Landslide Catalog maintained separately. It is current as of March 7, 2016. The original catalog is available here: http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmaps.nccs.nasa.gov%2Fserver%2Frest%2Fservices%2Fglobal_landslide_catalog%2Fglc_viewer_service%2FFeatureServer&source=sd.

DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis to compute weekly station position solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. The IDS Analysis Center Coordinator combines these individual AC solutions in a standard least-squares adjustment to generate the official IDS weekly combined station position solution. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/DORIS/DORIS_product_holdings.html.
