* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Ultra-Rapid Orbit/Clock/ERP Product Comparison Summary from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7aes-si8s) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Rapid Orbit/Reference Frame Product Summary from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce GNSS derived products. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS ultra-rapid combined orbit and ERP products. The ultra-rapid orbit and ERP is a sub-daily solution, released four times per day, at 03:00, 09:00, 15:00, and 21:00 UTC (prior to GPS week 1267 they were released twice daily). The solution summary file details information about the generation of the daily rapid products and comparison with the individual AC solutions. The reduced latency on availability of these products allows for significantly improved orbit predictions and reduced errors for user applications.

* [PHOBOS 2 MARS TERMOSKAN EDITED THERMAL/VIS IMAGING EDR V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/et5i-mqgb) - In February and March, 1989, the Termoskan instrument on board the Phobos '88 spacecraft of the USSR acquired a limited set of very high resolution simultaneous observations of the reflected solar flux (hereafter referred to as the visible channel) and emitted thermal flux (thermal infrared (IR)) from Mars's equatorial region. These are, so far, the highest spatial resolution thermal data ever obtained for Mars. Four slightly overlapping thermal panoramas (also called scans or swaths) cover a large portion of the equatorial region from 30S to 6N latitude. Simultaneous visible panoramas were taken during each of the four observing sessions; due to spacecraft memory limitations, visible channel processing was stopped early relative to the thermal channel for 2 of the sessions (2 and 4). Thus, the visible channel panoramas are shorter than the thermal panoramas for these sessions. These data are saved for historical reasons; they are not considered to be of archival quality.

* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vuh9-8uvt) - The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. FASIR-NDVI data are also used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface. There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.
* [Global Soil Texture and Derived Water-Holding Capacities (Webb et al.)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jshw-bg9i) - A standardized global data set of soil horizon thicknesses and textures (particle size distributions).
* [Continuous Electrode Inertial Electrostatic Confinement Fusion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4gjy-qz4d) - NASA recognizes within its roadmaps (specifically TA 3.1.6) that development of aneutronic fusion (such as p-11B) reactors with direct energy conversion (>80%) would be an enabling technology to achieve low specific mass (kg/kW) through the elimination of shielding and potentially the need for dedicated radiators. In addition, material activation due to neutron capture could be avoided. The challenge is of course to develop a plasma confinement system that is far less massive than the current leading (magnetic/inertial) approaches, but consumes less power than is generated by the fusion process – a feat that has yet to be achieved even terrestrially. Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) techniques offer the possible advantage of considerably lower mass, however they suffer from limitations that have hampered their development, just as plasma instabilities have hampered the development of magnetic systems. The difference is that considerable time, effort and funding have gone into the engineering of solutions to the plasma instability problem, whereas the limitations of IEC have always been viewed as “too fundamental”. The objectives of the proposed research are therefore two-fold: 1) To retire the broad fundamental criticisms of IEC devices by demonstrating feasible engineering solutions, and 2) To develop a comprehensive system-level performance model to support parametric scaling. The impact of successfully achieving the target specific mass of 2 kg/kW can be seen in the context of the previously proposed JIMO spacecraft. The full dry mass was about 24 metric tons, with 12 metric tons of Xe propellant. The fission reactor module mass was estimated at just over 6 tons, not including roughly 2 tons of radiator mass. At a power output of 200 kWe, the specific mass of the full power system (reactor+radiators) would have been about 40 kg/kW. At a target specific mass of ~2kg/kW, the same power system would have a mass of only 400 kg, saving 7.5 tons of dry mass and 3.5 tons of propellant. This is just over 30% reduction in total mass to orbit, at a savings of $220M. It is also worth noting that the fuel mass (assuming p-11B @ = 80%) for the entire 20 year mission design life, if operating continuously at 200 kWe, would amount to ~2.3 kg. Phase I of the research will be primarily dedicated to the development of the performance model to help motivate the efficacy of the approach in advance of Phase II. However, some effort in Phase I will address the key criticism of IEC devices, namely that of thermalization, through numerical simulation. In Phase II, more detailed modeling and numerical simulation of electron confinement within the device core, energy loss paths, and direct energy conversion of the fusion products will be done. The results of the Phase II effort would then be incorporated into a technology development plan.
* [Familiarization and Detection of Green Monopropellants](https://data.nasa.gov/d/49sb-nd4s) - <p>Ammonium dinitramide (ADN) and hydroxyl ammonium nitrate (HAN) are &quot;green&rdquo; monopropellants which will be appearing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for processing in the next few years. These are relatively safe replacements for hydrazine as a monopropellant; however, little is known about methods of leak detection, vapor scrubbing, air emissions, or cleanup that will be required for safe and environmentally benign operations at KSC.&nbsp;</p> <p>ADN was developed by the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), while HAN was developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory to be a propellant. Alliant Techsystems Inc (ATK) is predominantly evaluating ADN for future use, while Ball Aerospace was awarded a NASA Technology Demonstration Mission (TDM) to use HAN as a monopropellant to be launched from KSC/Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Kennedy Space Center needs the technology in place prior to their arrival and needs to make recommendations as to their adoption if significant issues are found.</p><p>This is novel work that is necessary to safely support the evaluation and development of the next generation of &ldquo;green&rdquo; propellants.&nbsp;The goal of this project is to develop leak detection and related technologies for the two new &rdquo;green&rdquo; monopropellants. This project is in its&nbsp;early stage of development; information regarding this project will be updated in the near future.</p>
* [Mass Production of Mature Lunar Regolith Simulant, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9qam-dky5) - As NASA prepares for future exploration activities on the Moon, there is a growing need to develop higher fidelity lunar soil simulants that can accurately reproduce the properties and behavior of lunar soil. Simulants are employed on earth to verify the performance of equipment, mechanisms, structures and processes to be used on the lunar surface. One of the significant limitations of current simulants is the lack of constituents, such as agglutinates and spherules, which often contain nano-phase iron (Fe0). These constituents are needed in any high fidelity simulant. Recently, Plasma Processes, Inc. (PPI) has developed a process to create simulated agglutinates and volcanic glasses from JSC-1A lunar regolith simulant. Microstructural characterization has shown that these components contain an appreciable amount of nano phase Fe0. However, current production of these simulant additives is limited. The ultimate objective of this Phase I effort is to develop an economical, large scale manufacturing process to produce simulant agglutinates and volcanic glasses. This production process promises to be a viable route for significantly enhancing the fidelity of existing and future lunar regolith simulants.
* [System for Acquisition and Analysis of Energy-Based Acoustic Data for Rocket Noise, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hjsy-izeb) - Accurate estimates of the vibroacoustic loading placed on space vehicles and payloads during launch require knowledge of the rocket noise source properties. Given the extreme nature of acoustic environments near the plume, data sufficient to characterize the noise source region have been difficult to acquire. Without these data, structures may be designed to handle an insufficient or excessive vibroacoustic loads, resulting in either an overbuilt structure (and extra weight), or an under-designed vibration isolation system that could result in damaged cargos.
Current energy base acoustic probe designs have limited frequency bandwidth due to physical limitations. A new set of probe designs is proposed that incorporate both a new physical probe design but also a more advanced signal processing methodology that will significantly increase the usable frequency bandwidth of the probes while reducing the manufacturing and maintenance costs of the probes.
The probe system will also include the design of a complete data acquisition system capable of recording data under the harsh conditions present in typical rocket motor test firings.

* [Chromatid Painting for Chromosomal Inversion Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ubcw-du7d) - We propose a novel approach to the detection of chromosomal inversions. Transmissible chromosome aberrations (translocations and inversions) have profound genetic effects, such as disrupting regulatory sequences that control gene expression, or creating genetic chimeras. These chromosome aberrations play a causative role in cancer, and they are induced by radiation. As such, chromosome aberrations are relevant to three NASA needs, biodosimetry, analysis of astronaut lymphocytes for cumulative radiation damage, and space radiation risk modeling. Of all structural chromosomal anomalies, inversions -- a reversal of orientation of material within a chromosome -- are the most difficult to detect. This is especially true of small inversions, most of which are invisible to all current cytogenetic techniques. Yet small inversions are likely the most transmissible (nonlethal) form of chromosomal damage, so they persist, a feature which lends credence to their use in retrospective biodosimetry. This Phase 1 project is intended to provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of a new method of molecular cytogenetics that will permit highly sensitive inversion detection. The project will help us to perfect our bioinformatics strategy for probe design, optimize probe labeling reactions, refine hybridization conditions, and establish a procedure for cost analysis. In Phase 2, we will scale-up probe production to make whole chromosome analysis possible. This next step, although conceptually simple, relies entirely on the processes devised and tested in Phase 1. Moreover efficient, cost-effective probe-making will be essential to commercialization (Phase 3). The technology readiness level at the end of the Phase 1 contract is expected to be 4-5, i.e. validated in laboratory and relevant environments.
* [Multifunctional Shielding and Self-Healing HybridSil Smart Composites for Space, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/grz3-i34g) - NanoSonic has recently developed multifunctional shielding and self-healing HybridSil&#63720; (HS) smart composites via the inclusion of innovative nanoshell inclusions. These lightweight yet high-strength rapidly self-healing materials combined with NanoSonic's Metal Rubber&#153; (MR) shielding nano-additives and are offered herein as protection systems for NASA vehicles, habitat modules, and pressure vessel structures. The conductive aspect of Metal Rubber also enables damage detection. This technology may overcome the current bottleneck of damage tolerance for current composites that form nearly undetectable cracks upon impact that impart drastic effects on the structural survivability. HS-MR self-healing composites offer both self-healing and damage detection, as well as the added functionality of very high levels of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) without the need for additional heavy layers. MR exhibits EMI SE of greater than -100 dB upon exposure to a blow torch, repeated cold flexing at -50 °C, and irradiation under a 60Co source. During Phase I, TRL 5 shall be reached upon demonstration of damage tolerant, self-healing structural composites with assistance from our radiation expert STTR partner, CSU, and commercial space partner. During Phase II, TRL 7 shall be achieved upon demonstrated damage detection and self-healing in a representative flight environment with our defense prime partner.
* [Fast Neutron Dosimeter for the Space Environment, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vzxn-euj5) - Model calculations and risk assessment estimates indicate that secondary neutrons, with energies ranging between 0.5 to >150 MeV, make a significant contribution to the total absorbed dose received by space crews during long duration space missions [1-3]. Advanced scintillation materials, which exhibit radiation type and mass dependent emission times, coupled to SSPM detectors, provide the optimum volume to payload performance and the ability to easily discriminate between the fraction of dose, which results from secondary neutrons, and that which results from exposure to energetic charged particles and background gamma-rays.
The Phase-1 effort successfully characterized the critical components of the proposed dosimeter, specifically, the response of the scintillation material to irradiation by gamma-rays, protons, and neutrons, as well as the performance of the SSPM detector. The Phase-1 modeling studies provide a critical foundation for assessing the anticipated signals in the space radiation environment. The proposed dosimeter would overcome many of the limitations in the current generation of neutron dosimeters, and would provide baseline information on the physics, needed with the information from biological studies, to assess risk in future human-space-exploration missions to the moon and Mars.

* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Rapid Clock Product Summary from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pu4h-p8nj) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Rapid Clock Product Summary from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce GNSS satellite and ground receiver clock values. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS rapid combined satellite and receiver clock products. The rapid combination is a daily solution available approximately 17 hours after the end of the previous UTC day. All satellite and receiver clock solution files utilize the clock RINEX format and span 24 hours from 00:00 to 23:45 UTC.
* [Spectral Mass-Gauging of Unsettled Liquid With Acoustic Waves](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xv5u-4iat) - <p>The ability to quickly and accurately gauge the amount of available propellant in a tank is one of the basic requirements of propellant management.</p> <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under settled or partially settled conditions, various mass-gauging techniques are under development. However, these techniques require installation of hardware inside the tank which is undesirable.</p> <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; In microgravity (unsettled) conditions, both the location and shape of the ullage are <em>a priori </em>unknown. Presently, there are no technological solutions capable of determining the volume of unsettled liquid propellant for arbitrary ullage shapes in a tank<sup>1</sup> to within a few per cent accuracy as required for deep space NASA missions.<sup>2-3</sup></p> <p>The proposed approach aims to overcome the two major limitations of the present technologies: (1) the need of installation of hardware inside the tank; (2) assumption of particular ullage shape. In addition, the approach is (3) applicable to both conducting (MMH) and non-conducting liquids (LOx, LH2) (in contrast to RFMG approach); (4) based on different physical principles from the existing approaches, therefore enabling the required redundancy in mass-gauging in&nbsp; those cases (settled or partially settled liquids), where alternative approaches are satisfactory.</p> <p>Overall Concept: Spectral Mass-gauging (SMG) &ndash; computes propellant volume using the acoustic resonances counting function in the propellant tank; it is based on rigorous results from spectral theory (Weyl&rsquo;s Law), providing a shape-invariant spectral characteristics4. Weyl&rsquo;s law provides a rigorous tool to infer the volume of the liquid in partially filled tanks: (i) for arbitrary shapes of the ullage, (ii) systematically controlling accuracy, limited only by the acoustic dissipation, which is found to be very low in space applications and allows reaching theoretical limit of fractions of percent of the tank volume. While Weyl&rsquo;s law is well-known in mathematical community and has been tested in fundamental research5, it has never been applied to acoustic mass-gauging of liquids in space applications, where it offers big promise due to the large dimensions of the tanks; nature of the fluid (liquid) and character of the boundary conditions (vacuum).</p>
* [Spatial Heterodyne Spectrometer for Aviation Hazard Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ubk3-ut3a) - Physical Sciences Inc (PSI) proposes the development of a longwave infrared (LWIR) imaging spatial heterodyne spectrometer (I-SHS) for standoff detection of clear air turbulence (CAT) and wake vortices from an airborne platform. PSI will team with Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) who has produced significant research on the application of LWIR hyperspectral imaging for detection of these and other air hazards. The research has produced extensive simulations, however, the predicted spectral radiance signatures are an order of magnitude below the noise floor of state of the art in LWIR hyperspectral imagers. The proposed LWIR I-SHS will offer this order of magnitude improvement in noise equivalent spectral radiance through a combination of high throughput and minimal noise-inducing sampling errors owing to the stationary interferometer. A preliminary systems analysis predicts a per-pixel NESR of 1E-9 W/(cm^2 ster cm^-1) at 16 cm^-1 spectral resolution. In Phase I, PSI will formalize a system performance model and will produce and characterize a breadboard I-SHS which will be used to demonstrate a molecular imaging measurement as a surrogate for a wake vortex. With the support of GTRI, PSI will generate requirements and a conceptual design for a TRL 5 system to be developed in Phase II.
* [RIDES: Raman Icing Detection System, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rnac-b4qp) - Inflight icing of engines and airframe presents a significant hazard to air transport, especially at lower flight elevations during take-off or on approach. Ice accretions on the wings affect the smooth flow required for proper lift. A thin layer of coarse ice can reduce the lift by 30 percent and increase drag by up to 40 percent. In addition, accretions can also reduce the air intake in engines and affect readings from a (heated) Pitot tube. Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) proposes to continue the development of an integrated LIDAR instrument capable of identifying icing conditions while also allowing for air data sensing as well as other hazard detection capabilities. The resulting Raman Icing Detection System (RIDES), when coupled with MAC's optical air data solution, will provide unprecedented situational awareness and aircraft safety. The proposed solution will operate without protrusions into the flow, behind a common flush-mounted window on the skin of the aircraft, mitigating the risk of ice build-up during operation and therefore providing a critical redundancy through dissimilar measurement of air data parameters while greatly enhancing a pilot's awareness of potential icing hazards. MAC will build on its successful Phase I trade-study and design effort through the fabrication and demonstration of a Phase II prototype in an icing wind tunnel.
* [High Frequency Reflective Mesh for Small Aperture Antennas, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yswd-c9ht) - The proposed Phase II program would develop and prototype a high frequency, high performance reflective mesh that is well suited to the emerging small aperture antenna designs. The program will build on the testing knowledge of the Phase I prototyped mesh. 40 OPI gold mesh will be prototyped and integrated to a cubesat Ka-band reflector. Carbon nanotube yarn will also be knitted into a 30 OPI mesh and tested on a similar antenna. The Phase II program will move the mesh to TRL 6. The goal is to make cost effective and robust mesh for the small aperture antenna community. RF test samples and a complete deployable Ka-band antenna will be delivered to NASA JPL for RF testing.
* [Green, Compact Hybrids for Nanosatellite Launchers, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q865-2xia) - Low cost access to space is essential for continued commercial exploitation of near-earth environments, and to support future science missions. A serious limitation on the cost of space access is the available propellants and propulsion system technologies for launch, orbital insertion, maneuvering and orbital reinsertion, and reaction and attitude control.This Phase I STTR program will validate ignition and performance parameters for a volumetrically-optimized, low cost, green, shippable hybrid propellant motor for low cost access to space. The program is specifically targeted at validating performance via fabrication and delivery of replacements for the current Nihka and PSRM-120 stages (stage 2 and 3) based on the Black Brandt sounding rocket vehicle testbed under the Nanolaunch 1200 program guidelines.
* [Polarized Microwave Background Technologies for Inflationary Gravitational Wave Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/256p-r8hu) - The detection of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) from the epoch of inflation is one of the next majors goals in cosmology. These PGWs leave a signature on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) called the primordial "B-modes." The quest for detection of this signature has launched substantial technological development because this signal is predicted to be one part in a billion of the unpolarized signal. The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a ground based telescope array which will measure the polarization of the CMB to unprecedented accuracy. This measurement will require the development of several technologies which will be required for the possible space mission outlined in the Epoch of Inflation Technology push. CLASS will be an important test-bed for these technologies and will raise the technology readiness level of several relevant instruments. CLASS will use extremely sensitive antenna-coupled transition edge sensors and a rapid front-end polarization modulator to make a multifrequency measurement of the polarized CMB on the largest angular scales. By searching for the predicted peak in the primordial B-mode power spectrum, CLASS will detect the PGW signature if the tensor to scalar ratio is greater than 0.01. A detection of primordial gravitational waves from the epoch of inflation would have transformative effects on the field of cosmology. The technological advances made through the development of CLASS could achieve this detection while simultaneously raising the technology readiness level for future missions.

* [Neuromorphic UAS Collision Avoidance](https://data.nasa.gov/d/666h-g8j6) - <p>Collision avoidance for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) traveling at high relative speeds is a challenging task. It requires both the detection of a possible collision and deployment of an appropriate maneuver to avoid it, to be done in few seconds or less. NASA Langley and Boston University are engaged in a collaborative effort to design neuromorphic optic flow algorithms to avoid collisions and embed these algorithms in small, low-weight, and low-power customized hardware solutions in UAS.<p/><p>Using biologically-inspired neuromorphic optic flow algorithms is a novel approach in collision avoidance for UAS. Traditional computer vision algorithms rely on solving nonlinear partial differential equation systems to estimate optic flow which is a computationally expensive task. Neuromorphic algorithms instead make use of lessons learned in biology to solve these problems in a more efficient manner. An example is the fly's motion detector, which can be modeled by a system that uses a set of locally calculated, parallel spatio-temporal correlations for a set of velocities determined by the input sampling rates and flying speeds. Correlation results are interpreted as likelihood for a motion direction and speed. Stages of obstacle detection and tracking can temporally and spatially integrate these likelihoods to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and in turn the detection rate. In addition to its computational efficiency, the proposed neuromorphic solution is more stable and noise tolerant than solving a nonlinear optimization problem. Even if single computational nodes get corrupted due to functional or structural failures in the hardware, the performance of appropriately designed parallel, distributed neuromorphic algorithms degrades gracefully. Neuromorphic algorithms are commonly implemented using software running on general-purpose multicore/graphic processing unit systems. This approach, though flexible, can have significant overhead in terms of power, performance, and is not easily portable across platforms, therefore reducing its scope of applicability. In the second phase, we will port the neuromorphic algorithms to field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application specific integrated chips (ASICs). This will allow us to meet demanding performance requirements needed in UAS such as fast processing, low weight, low power consumption, as well as robustness to hardware failure.</p>

* [Resin Infusion Fabrication of nanostructured PMC, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wdja-mzs9) - Polymer reinforced composite parts required for heavy lift launch vehicles are currently fabricated by hand lay-up or automated tape lay-up followed by curing using heat, pressure, vacuum and inert atmosphere. Composite structures for future applications are expected to be larger than 9 meters in diameter and greater than 10 meters in length. Such large composite structures cannot be fabricated by regular autoclaving processes because of limitations of the size of autoclaves and high costs associated with energy consumption. In this Phase I effort, MMI will develop a novel out-of-autoclave processing method for the fabrication of nanostructured polymer matrix composites for fabrication of light weight structural parts of large dimensions. This phase of research will also involve a system analysis of the technology to identify the benefits and target areas of use. A correlation study based system analyses will provide a path to apply the fabrication methods to fabricate large composite parts used in aircraft structures. Phase II will scale up the technology and demonstrate property enhancements. The resin infusion process proposed will be suitable for economical manufacture of large parts. The nanocomposite reinforcement proposed will also afford better mechanical properties to the polymer matrix composite.

* [A Novel Microfluidic Device for Fully Automated Extraction of RNA from Cell Cultures, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/94qm-7vfw) - Obtaining high quality, intact RNA from cells is an ubiquitous need in the pursuit of space biology. Our overall objective is to develop and commercialize a microfluidics based miniaturized platform (MED-RNA) that can fully automate the complex process of RNA isolation. Starting from harvested whole mammalian cells in a culture medium, MED-RNA will lyse, capture, and isolate RNA content for later analysis, in a fully integrated fashion with minimal user intervention. In addition to higher yields and faster process times, losses and contamination will be minimized as a result of the miniaturization and automation. A novel and unique plastic card based fabrication technology from Micronics Corp. will be leveraged for low-cost microfabrication. The Phase I study successfully demonstrated concept development and design of three critical aspects of the MED-RNA, (1) on-card reagent based cell lysis, (2) non-toxic electric field driven cell lysis, and (3) RNA capture and elution in a microfluidic extraction chamber. Physical prototypes of the components were fabricated and experimentally demonstrated. During Phase II, we will further optimize the individual component designs. Optimal components, along with necessary valving will be integrated on a plastic, microfluidic lab card. The fully integrated prototype lab card will be demonstrated on chosen cell lines. Further ensuring success, CFDRC has assembled an experienced, multidisciplinary team.
* [Uncooled High-Performance InAsSb Focal Plane Arrays, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a7mf-rnn4) - SVT Associates proposes an innovative digital alloy technique to extend the cutoff wavelength of InAsSb beyond 5 um, a wider band gap InAlAsSb layer inserted into depletion region to suppress dark current, and atomic layer deposition technique to coat radiation-hard material AlN on InAsSb detectors grown on GaSb substrate. This digital alloy InAsSb material system is capable of infrared detection between 0.4-5 um, depending on layer thickness of the period of each digital ultra thin superlattice. The goal of this program is to develop InAsSb-based FPA for 0.4-5 um detection at room temperature. Photo detector arrays using this material are of great interest to the NASA for various applications including, in particular, imaging and optical detection, and object discrimination when tracking targets in space or performing astronomical observations. These MWIR photo detectors can also find application to infrared-based chemical identification systems and terrestrial mapping. Applying the dark current suppression and cutoff wavelength extension process to the InAsSb-based detectors should result in higher operating temperature, extended cutoff wavelength, and radiation-hard devices, all important factors that should significantly enhance FPA operation. We intend to characterize the positive effects of proposed techniques in Phase I. In Phase II we will refine the techniques to realize high-performance MWIR FPAs operating at ambient temperatures.

LignaMed aims to evaluate LGM2605 as a mitigator of space-radiation induced vascular damage. NASA missions to Mars will expose astronauts to solar and galactic cosmic mixed radiation including low dose &#947; and proton radiation, but data is lacking on the biological and physiological effects in humans of this mixed source radiation. Research on space radiation effects on cellular systems, molecular targets and ultimately organ systems has identified potential harmful short and long-term effects on the health of astronauts. Work at the University of Pennsylvania identified damage to lungs years after a single exposure to low-dose gamma, 56Fe, 28Si and proton radiation exposure in mice. Acute and chronic radiation effects in organs are closely associated with vascular damage and dysfunction. Multiple studies have confirmed single source radiation side effects associated with significant loss of vascular integrity: increased vascular leakiness (edema), an activated inflammatory phenotype and extensive oxidative damage. However, damage to the vascular network under multiple radiation types simultaneously is not understood. LignaMed will employ gene knockout technology in vascular models exposed to space-relevant mixed radiation regimens to investigate the injury to the vasculature. We hypothesize that LGM2605 will mitigate space radiation-induced vascular damage by inhibiting early events that cause inflammation. This study will confirm that 1) space radiation drives endovascular damage via activation of the endothelial inflammatory phenotype resulting in increased permeability and 2) will validate LGM2605 as an effective mitigator of space radiation-induced vascular damage by inhibiting early events that drive long term adverse sequellae.
* [Dual Use Packaging, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pj9x-unnv) - NASA seeks down-weighted packaging compatible with microwave preparation and perhaps high hydrostatic pressure processing. New packaging must satisfy NASA's 3-year storage mandate. Foil laminate containers meet NASA's oxygen, moisture and general shelf life demands; however, their weight, processing and disposal characteristic are not ideal. A previous NASA SBIR examined nanobarrier-containing packages; but these did not perform to NASA's needs. The current SBIR proposes to remove oxygen electrochemically, control moisture independent of the packaging, and also carefully selecting packaging materials to perform some second generation function. Using non-packaging-related control of oxygen and moisture allows versatile selection of primary packaging to permit packaging concepts unacceptable under NASA's existing packaging paradigm. These include edible packaging, soluble pre-weighed reconstitutable cartridges for beverages, and packages designed for compatibility with mission-grown foods. Primary food packs would be bundled in an overpack designed to remove oxygen and to manage moisture. The overpack would itself serve a secondary mission function. Overpack materials might include photovoltaic polymer sheets, light emitting plastics, or might simply serve a a waste or food storage function. Shifting oxygen and moisture control away from packaging allows package construction from much lighter material with reduced weight, processing and disposal limitations. A dialog on extravehicular food storage is proposed

* [Activity modeling under uncertainty by trace of objects in smart homes](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cstk-9fa3) - A typical resident of a smart home can be an Alzheimer patient that forgets sometimes to complete the activities that he begins. The key point to assist the smart home resident is to model the activities and discover correct realization patterns of activities. To accomplish this task, we apply sensors to provide primary data about realization patterns of actions, operations, plans, goals and generally any objective that the smart home resident may desire to do. In the consequence, by applying fuzzy clustering techniques, we are able to mine sensor data to retrieve the realization patterns of activities, and so the prediction patterns of intentions are recognizable. Comparing the realization patterns with prediction patterns of activities, we would be able to predict the intention of the resident about the activity that the resident considers to realize. In this way, we would be able to provide hypotheses about the resident goals and his possible goal achievement’s defects. Spatiotemporal aspects of daily activities such as movement of objects are surveyed to discover the patterns of activities realized by the smart homes residents. In this research, uncertainty is considered as a property of activity recognition.
* [LBA-ECO LC-03 Hypsography, Rivers, Roads, and DEM, Four Areas across Brazilian Amazon](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nvz7-z46g) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides four related spatial data products for four study areas across the Brazilian Amazon: Manaus, Amazonas; Tapajos National Forest, Para Western (Santarem); Rio Branco, Acre; and Rondonia, Rondonia. Products include vector data showing (1) roads, (2) rivers, and (3) hypsography and (4) digital elevation model (DEM) images that were encoded from the hypsography vectors. There are 15 data files with this data set which includes 12 compressed *.zip files containing ArcInfo shape files and 3 GeoTIFFS.This data set contains vector data showing roads, rivers, and hypsography for each study area in ESRI ArcGIS shapefile format. The vectors were hand-digitized by the Images Company in Brazil from paper maps produced by the Brazilian government. Depending on the scale of the original maps, the digitization errors vary. For some maps, some vectors are missing. Data were manually checked for duplicate or extra vectors. These data sets were derived from several map sheets produced from aerial coverages dating from 1974 to 1978.The DEM images were encoded from the hypsography vectors and are provided in GeoTIFF format. The attribute value associated with each line and point in the vector segment is encoded into the image channel; the image channel is then filled in by interpolating image data between encoded vector data. For each DEM: 1 image channel with pixel resolution = 25m x 25m. DEM images are provided for Manaus, Tapajos National Forest, and Rondonia. The files for Rio Branco were unusable due to a documentation error.DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products. KNOWN PROBLEMS:The data providers note that due to limited resources, these data have been neither validated nor quality-assured for general use. For that reason, extreme caution is advised when considering the use of these data. - Any use of the derived data is not recommended because the results have not been validated.- However, the DEM, vectors, and orthorectified SAR data (related data set) can be used if the user understands how these were produced and accepts the limitations.
* [SASSI: Subsystems for Automated Subsurface Sampling Instruments, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3va7-wbue) - Autonomous surface sampling systems are necessary, near term, to construct a historical view of planetary significant events; as well as allow for the identification of materials useful for ISRU activities. Paramount to this is exploration missions capable of in-situ analysis of core samples that deliver the stratigraphy of the target. These sample handling technologies must be developed to meet a broad range of potential requirements, including a variety of rock or subsurface materials, rigorous sample preservation requirements, and the general problem of autonomous operation in the presence of dust and with limited resources. Honeybee seeks to develop critical subsystems for a small, low-mass, low-power Rotary-Percussive Corer (RoPeC) capable of autonomous sample acquisition and delivery from a depth of 5 cm. Specific attention will be given to the tall-pole items including the core break-off, retention, delivery, rotary-percussive drive, and gas flushing subsystems. Near term applications include the Astrobiology Field Laboratory and Mars Sample Return missions. Previous coring tool development has focused on integration and far-horizon proof of concepts; resulting in complete systems designed around specific requirements. The path forward lies in maturing specific aspects of designs quickly. The Phase 1 research has resulted in a survey of existing sampling systems as well as a conceptual design of the RoPeC with a focus on modularity. In Phase 2, Honeybee will mature the design of RoPeC subsystems; including the integration of a percussive voice coil actuator developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Powder Acquisition Drill System. A focus on modularity will ensure that subsystems can be redesigned independently; enabling the acquisition of core samples in targets including MEPAG suggested rocks, MSL Mars analogs and Phoenix analogs. This will lead to the a TRL of 5-6.
* [Real-Time Fault Contingency Management for Integrated Vehicle Health Management, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yv2n-erq4) - Impact Technologies, with support from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Honeywell, propose to develop and demonstrate a suite of real-time Fault Contingency Management (FCM) algorithms for application within an Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) system. The proposed FCM software will implement a novel vehicle subsystem fault accommodation approach based on a seamless integration between real-time system health identification and adaptive controller techniques. Specifically, the continuous health assessment algorithms include a real-time adaptive recursive system identification algorithm and an enhanced real-time moving horizon estimation (MHE) algorithm that will be developed and implemented on a prototype embedded system. The proposed FCM software hierarchy will act from the subsystems level up through the vehicle level and will implement fault-accommodating control, health management, and contingency management to accomplish its goal. The significant technology advancement proposed herein is based on the use of dynamic simulation models in a real-time computing environment to not only update health status predictions, but also to determine "on the fly" how accommodate for them. At the conclusion of Phase I, the project team will deliver a proof-of-concept demonstration of the proposed techniques running on an embedded platform using high fidelity propulsion and aircraft simulation models.
* [A Novel Technology for Simultaneous TOC Reduction and Biofouling Prevention, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dazf-46eb) - Long-duration space missions such as the upcoming Moon and Mars missions require reliable systems for the preparation of potable water through efficient recycling, and prevention of biofilm growth on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and water lines. Lynntech, Inc. proposes a novel technology to simultaneously reduce the total organic carbon (TOC) content of biological water processor (BWP) processed water, and control biofilm formation on water lines, surfaces and membranes within the water reclamation unit utilized on board spacecraft and within future planetary habitats. This technology is based on Lynntech's proprietary electrochemical on demand oxidizer generator, which does not require consumable chemicals. The on-demand produced oxidizer can be added to the primary processed water from the BWP unit. Using this innovative approach in the form of a compact TOC and microbial count (MC) reduction module which will be situated in line with the BWP unit, Lynntech aims to achieve an order of magnitude reduction in the TOC content within the BWP processed water. The residual oxidizer/disinfectant and reduced TOC will prevent the formation of biofilms on the RO membrane and water lines and will reduce the equivalent system mass by lowering the load on equipment downstream to the BWP, enabling a reduction in their size and weight. Phase I work will concentrate on providing proof-of-concept for the technology while Phase II will involve the fabrication of a prototype TOC and MC reduction module and its integration with the Integrated Advanced Water Recovery Test System operational at NASA-JSC.
* [Robust Optimal Fragmentation and Dispersion of Near-Earth Objects](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v5gs-qqib) - <p>During the past 2 decades, various concepts for mitigating the impact threats from NEOs have been proposed, but many of these concepts were impractical and not technically credible. In particular, all non-nuclear techniques require mission lead times larger than 10 years. However, for the most probable impact threat with a warning time less than 10 years, the use of high-energy nuclear explosives in space becomes inevitable for proper fragmentation and dispersion of an NEO in a collision course with Earth. However, the existing nuclear subsurface penetrator technology limits the impact velocity to less than 300m/s because higher impact velocities destroy prematurely the detonation electronic equipment. Thus, an innovative space system architecture utilizing high-energy nuclear explosives must be developed for a worst-case intercept mission resulting in relative closing velocities as high as 5-30km/s. An advanced system concept is proposed for nuclear subsurface explosion missions. The concept blends a hypervelocity kinetic-energy impactor with nuclear subsurface explosion, and exploits a 2-body space vehicle consisting of a fore body and an aft body. These 2 spacecraft bodies may be connected by a deployable boom. The fore body provides proper kinetic impact crater conditions for an aft body carrying nuclear explosives to make a deeper penetration into an asteroid body. For such a complex mission architecture design study, non-traditional, multidisciplinary research efforts in the areas of hypervelocity impact dynamics, nuclear explosion modeling, high-temperature thermal shielding, shock-resistant electronic systems, and advanced space system technologies are required. Expanding upon the current research activities, the Iowa State Asteroid Deflection Research Center will develop an innovative, advanced space system architecture that provides the planetary defense capabilities needed to enable a future real space mission more efficient, affordable, and reliable.</p>
* [An Optical Wake Vortex Detection System for Super-Density Airport Operation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bhxi-t6ia) - OSI proposes to develop a wake vortex detection system including a group of double-ended and single-ended optical scintillometers properly deployed in the airfield to measure ground and near ground crosswind, turbulence, and wake vortex using atmospheric turbulence-induced optical scintillations. As part of efforts, OSI also proposes to develop a single-ended optical scintillometer, together with a retro-reflector, for the measurement of near ground real-time crosswind and wake vortex. OSI will perform system analysis and design of the proposed system to detect occurrences, location, magnitude, and persistence of wake turbulence. With the simultaneous measurements of crosswind and turbulence, the sensor system is also able to forecast the arrival time of the airplane generated wake vortex drifting to a nearby runway. In the Phase I effort, OSI will determine the optimum siting criteria of deploying the double-ended and single-ended sensors on the airport. This includes combinations of parallel to runway, cross the runway, and retro-reflector on high towers installations. The goal is to form a network of sensors to cover essential areas of airport field to provide wake vortex data for the predictive modeling of wake vortex hazard. As a side benefit, the vortex detection system could measure downdraft by deploying two sets of scintillometers on both sides of the runway. The line-averaged crosswind measured by the two sets will provide real-time continuous measurements of convergence and divergence of the wind field between the two optical paths. Vertical winds, and hence the downdraft, can be derived from the measured divergence. The proposed vortex detection system will also be able to provide critical large area wind information. By incorporating this valuable information into the low-level wind shear modeling, it will greatly enhance the performance of the present airport low-level wind shear systems.
* [The Enceladus Organic Analyzer](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wdya-7y6v) - Quantitative compositional and chiral organic molecule analysis is key to understanding an extraterrestrial location including its history, habitability and potential for past or present life. Few high-TRL instruments exist that can achieve this important goal. The advancement of the Enceladus Organic Analyzer (EOA) to TRL 6 will enable a powerful new approach for characterizing carbon chemistry in our solar system including the non-statistical distribution of organic molecules and optical isomers that tell us about the presence of extant or extinct life.
EOA is an innovative microchip capillary electrophoresis (μCE) system with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. The µCE electrophoretically separates molecules with high resolution, and is very effective for analysis of organics having a wide range of sizes and complexity from a variety of solid, ice or liquid sources. The integrated Programmable Microfluidic Analyzer (PMA) enables reliable, flexible fluidic processing. LIF is highly sensitive with picomolar concentration limits of detection (the equivalent of only attomoles detected).
EOA SCIENCE OBJECTIVES
Detect and quantify amines, amino acids, carboxylic acids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with parts-per-million sensitivity from samples as small as a few micrograms.
Separate multiple (>20) amine-containing species (including amino acids) that differ in isomer or carbon chain-length with baseline resolution. Perform similar analyses on carboxylic acids and polycyclic aromatics.
Separate chiral enantiomers of any observed amino acids.
EOA MISSIONS
Enceladus Plume Fly-By/Orbiter. The organic composition of the Enceladus plume is a high-priority science objective in the NASA Science Plan and the Decadal Survey prioritized an Enceladus orbiter.
Comets. The EOA could be used to sample and analyze organics from comets and their coma that are beyond sample return to answer questions about primordial sources of organic matter and current synthesis.
Icy Moon organic analysis. The core EOA analyzer instrument could also be deployed in orbiters, fly-by or lander missions that acquire solid/ice samples.
TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
Raise TRL of the PMA. This technology is at a high TRL (5) having been extensively tested in lab and challenging field applications. Our objective is to fully demonstrate the PMA in a relevant environment as an integrated prototype raising TRL to 6.
Raise TRL of LIF. LIF laser and optical detection systems have over a decade of development for space flight beginning with the Urey instrument for the ExoMars rover to the MOA instrument proposed for Mars 2020. This subsystem will be built and tested to elevate its TRL from 5 to 6.
Raise TRL of the Capture Plate System from 3 to 6. When samples for the EOA are acquired from plumes or ejecta, a capture plate collects material during a fly by. An efficient soft impact capture has been developed that obviates the confounding problem of organic contamination found with other soft impact strategies like aerogels.
Raise TRL of the integrated system including all peripheral hardware and control electronics. The TRL of most EOA components and subsystems is as high as 5. We will build and test an integrated technology demonstration unit with flight-like component subsystems raising the TRL of the whole instrument to 6.
RELEVANCE
The proposed work seeks to “develop and demonstrate” the EOA as a “planetary and astrobiology science instrument to the point where it may be proposed in response to future announcements of opportunity without additional extensive technology development (TRL 6).”
The EOA is an “innovative technology that improves instrument measurement capabilities” in a “small, low mass, low power” package, and is poised to “address significant scientific questions relevant to stated NASA goals.”
DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN is not required because this proposal is for instrument development only.
* [Transport, Chemistry, and Energetics of Water in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere and Implications for Polar Mesospheric Cloud Occurrence](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7c89-a6q2) - <p>The overall goal of this proposal is to study the time-dependent neutral chemistry and transport of water in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) and to determine the resultant impact on the local temperature and ice cloud formation. To reach this goal, we will answer three science questions: 1. What is the energetic and chemical response of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere to water deposited in the lower thermosphere? 2. How does the injection of large amounts of water vapor change the thermodynamics and impact the physics of PMC formation? 3. How is the water vapor that gets injected into the lower thermosphere, redistributed vertically to the PMC region near 82 km? To answer these questions we propose to release a plume of water vapor at high latitudes from a rocket payload and observe how the atmosphere responds both during and after the release. We will observe the evolution of the plume of water with lidar measurements from Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR). The lidar is capable of tracking both the optical emissions from the region and measuring the temperature profiles. In addition, an Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM) instrument will be deployed at PFRR to observe the upper mesosphere (~87 km) before and during the water release to provide quantitative information on any dynamics/wave activity and changes in mesospheric temperature. The combination of the lidar and mapping imager thus provides strong ground-based diagnostics for the launch. The launch will be at twilight so that any formation of PMCs from the plume will be visible from the ground. Trimethyl aluminum (TMA) trails will be released in addition to the water from a separate payload canister. The TMA is chemi-luminescent and can be tracked optically from the ground with cameras and the naked eye. The movement of the TMA trails will thus provide a direct indication of how the water is moving since both will be transported by the background winds. The TMA measurements will be helpful both for real-time waater cloud tracking and for post-flight analysis. Our ground-based observations will be supported by observations from the NASA TIMED and AIM missions and modeling result from the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics General Circulation Model (TIMEGCM). We will interpret the observations of PMCs and temperature variations from the TIMED satellite that are driven by the plume chemistry with our TIMEGCM model. The TIMEGCM will be augmented to include all heating and cooling contributions from the plume water vapor, any resultant ice formation as well as vertical transport and heating of the ambient atmosphere by the ice. Model results will be compared with observed PMC data from AIM and corresponding TIMED/SABER temperatures to elucidate and understand the relationship between PMCs and bulk thermodynamics. Perceived significance: The proposed project deals with a science investigation that can be carried out with instruments flown on suborbital sounding rockets. It contributes to the science goal of &ldquo;understanding the fundamental physical processes of the space environment&rdquo; (2010 Science Plan for NASA SMD). The proposal is also relevant to the NASA Heliophysics Roadmap, including two out of three overarching objectives: (Open the Frontiers to Space Environment Prediction, and Understand the Nature of our Home in Space) and their associated Research Focus Areas. It also complements work performed under the NASA AIM and TIMED missions.</p>
* ["Compact Color Biofinder" for fast, non-contact detection of bio-markers, biomolecules and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in Ocean Worlds](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fnma-pgh3) - We have developed a prototype instrument called “Standoff Biofinder” which is able to detect biomolecules and bio-markers from a collection of rocks and minerals in a large area with detection time of 0.1 s. The Standoff Biofinder takes advantage of the short lifetime of bio-fluorescent materials to obtain real-time images showing the locations of biological materials among luminescent minerals in a geological context. The instrument works in daylight as well as nighttime conditions and bio-detection capability is not affected by the background light. The Standoff Biofinder instrument will be suitable for locating fluorescent polyaromatic hydrocarbons, amino acids, proteins, bacteria, biominerals, photosynthetic pigments, and diagenetic products of microbial life both on dry landscapes as well as on Ocean Worlds of the outer Solar System (e.g., Enceladus, Europa, and Titan). At present, the images provided by the prototype biofinder are black and white images displaying the morphology and concentrations of biological molecules. In this proposal, we propose to develop the next generation of the instrument, “Compact Color Biofinder” (CoCoBi) which will provide color fluorescent images of biological species in a target area. One of the advantages of the color biofinder over the present biofinder system would be ability to differentiate multiple biological materials in a target area which may contain a mixture of biological species in various concentrations. CoCoBi will be helpful in identifying the biological materials based on their fluorophore colors, along with morphologies and concentrations. In addition, the color-biofinder will be significantly miniaturized in size and will be an ideal “search for life” future mission instrument. CoCoBi will be designed to look for ppm levels of biomaterial from a standoff distance of several centimeters in a geological setting, as well as in water and ice, with detection time less than 1 s. An important feature of the Standoff Biofinder instrument is its capability to detect biomolecules which are deeper in water and ice, without sample collection. The CoCoBi instrument will be useful for locating a biological material during future NASA rover, lander, and crewed missions to Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, Enceladus, Europa, Titan, asteroids etc. Additionally, the instrument can be used for non-contact, non-destructive detection of biological materials in priceless samples obtained from sample return missions from other planets and asteroids. Under this project, the TRL of the proposed compact color biofinder instrument will advance from TRL 2 to TRL 4.
* [Development of Nanopore Sequencing for Automated Ocean World Life Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/x39w-j4qz) - In this COLDTech project, a solid-state nanopore instrument will be developed for the detection and study of biomarkers for microbial life in ocean world environments. The Sequencing of Life on Ocean Worlds (SeqLOW) instrument is a solid-state nanopore platform designed for the detection and characterization of polyanionic and polycationic polymers. SeqLOW heritage is derived from Oxford Nanopore’s MinION instrument, a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product. The MinION is a small, portable DNA sequencing platform that consists of protein nanopores embedded in an electrically resistant polymer material. The MinION is third generation sequencing technology and is robust enough for in situ field analysis here on Earth. The system is slated to be tested on the International Space Station in the summer of 2016. However, the integrity of the current protein nanopore membrane used in the MinION is not sufficiently robust to survive long duration space missions. The SeqLOW solid-state nanopore platform will advance current state-of-the-art nanopore sensing technology as a life detection instrument for use in future NASA missions.
SeqLOW COLDTech development goals are:
1) Development and fabrication of robust solid-state nanopore membranes with arrays of different pore diameters for detection of multiple types of biomarkers (i.e. DNA, charged proteins, amino acids, etc.).
2) Integration of the SeqLOW membranes into a microfluidic platform for in situ life detection. Microfluidics will be used to carry out sample processing, concentration, and delivery of the sample material to the solid-state membrane for analysis. Technologies and methods will be developed for sensor operation during deep space missions that eliminate: a) loss of analyte integrity, b) disruption of nanopore aperture, or c) disruption of pore current by sample interferences.
SeqLOW directly addresses the goals of the COLDTech program and NASA by “development of spacecraft-based instruments and technology for surface and subsurface exploration of ocean worlds such as Europa, Enceladus, and Titan.” SeqLOW also will address the NASA Planetary Science Division’s strategic goals and objectives and is focused on the detection of extant life in the “Ocean Worlds” of the outer Solar System.
* [Raising the Technology Readiness Level of 4.7-THz local oscillators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w6rn-2xyh) - <p>The 63-&mu;m (4.744 THz) [OI] fine-structure line is the dominant cooling line of warm, dense, neutral atomic gas. Because of its great intensity in high UV photodissociation regions (PDRs) and shocks, the [OI] 63-&mu;m line is superior in probing regions of massive star formation and the centers of galaxies. It is a unique probe of PDRs, shock waves from stellar winds/jets, supernova explosions, and cloud-cloud collisions. These radiative and mechanical interactions shape the interstellar medium of galaxies and drives galactic evolution. The size scale of the interactions can excite [OI] emission over many parsecs. Moreover, the emission regions are often complex, with multiple energetic sources processing the environment. Spectrally resolved observations of the [OI] line with a heterodyne receiver array will allow users to disentangle this convoluted interaction and permit the study of the energy balance, physical conditions, morphology and dynamics of these extended regions. In this way, such a receiver array will provide new, unique, insights into the interrelationship of stars and gas in a wide range of galactic and extragalactic environments. Despite the great potential, however, astrophysical observation of the OI line has rarely been performed because the frequency (4.744THz) is beyond the reach of most of the implemented local oscillators (LOs) in sensitive heterodyne receivers involving cryogenic mixers. In this proposed 3-year project, we plan to raise the TRL of THz QCLs for local oscillator applications to 5 or beyond, so that we will bridge this &ldquo;mid-TRL gap&rdquo; between a promising and enabling technology and a mission-ready component. Such a development will significantly reduce the risk of several proposed suborbital projects such as GUSTO (The Gal/Xgal U/LDB Spectroscopic/Stratospheric THz Observatory) which is a long-duration balloon flight. The proposed systems includes a 9-element heterodyne receiver array for the 4.744-THz OI line. Those heterodyne receiver arrays will require a large LO power level in a good beam pattern. Specifically, by end of the proposed project, we will develop single-mode DFB lasers with frequency to be within 10 GHz of the target 4.744 THz line, cw output power of ~5 mW with a wall-plug power efficiency of ~0.5% at an operating temperature of ~40 K, and beam patterns narrower than 10&times;10 degrees. This proposed project mainly addresses NASA&#39;s Strategic Subgoal 3D, Discover the origin, structure, evolution, and destiny of the universe, and search for Earth-like planets. It also addresses NASA&#39;s Strategic Subgoal 3A, Study planet Earth from space to advance scientific understanding and meet societal needs; and NASA&#39;s Strategic Subgoal 3C, Advance scientific knowledge of the origin and history of the solar system, the potential for life elsewhere, and the hazards and resources present as humans explore space.</p>
* [Active Battery Management System with Physics Based life modeling topology, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2dmb-7j88) - Robust Data Acquisition on flight applications enables Researchers to rapidly advance technology. Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) and Hybrid Electric architectures rely heavily on batteries to achieve fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions. DEP Aircraft of the future have demands for Energy Storage Systems with large counts of cells put in series and parallel to achieve needed voltage and energy levels. The X57 Maxwell Battery comprises of over 6000 cells. As the pack goes through repeated charge/discharge cycles, as well as environmental cycles, each individual cell begins to lose its capacity. Cell to cell capacity variation causes the entire pack to limited by the weakest cell. Traditional Passive Balancing topologies are limited in their ability to address cell mismatch on the discharge cycle. Active balancing allows a dynamic measurement & control system to discharge cells at variable rates. With a more robust measurement & control architecture, Active topologies have the ability to integrate more advanced algorithms. These algorithms include predictive health monitoring, life based management, physics based cell modelling. Batteries can last longer, avoid thermal runaway, and avoid maintenance. EPS is proposing development of an active BMS concept, with associated algorithms to achieve a 40% life improvement on the X57 pack.
* [Electro-Kinetic Ice Gun for Frozen Ice Plume Simulations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g6cd-ki4t) - This proposal evolved as a result of a conversation with a NASA scientist regarding plans for a mission to Europa to seek signs of life based on observed water plume emissions. With Jupiter as a bright light behind the moon, NASA was able to observe Europa in silhouette, and with ultraviolet light saw what appeared to be evidence of the plumes. If plumes exist, this is an exciting find, lead researcher William Sparks said. It means we may be able to explore that ocean, that ocean of Europa, and for organic chemicals, he added. It would allow us to search for signs of life without having to drill through miles of ice. The apparent plumes seem to be mostly around the south pole, Sparks said, although one appears farther north and may be a likelier candidate for a mission. "We presume it to be water vapor or ice particles because that's what Europa's made of, and those molecules do appear at the wavelengths we observed.
In preparation for such a mission, spacecraft will have to pass through dense clouds of ice particulates, which could damage vital instruments. Accordingly, NASA has indicated there is a need for simulating the production of ice in the size range of 50nm up through 2 microns. The NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range was designed to sent solid projectiles for studying the effects of meteorite impacts on celestial bodies and potential micro-meteoroid damage to spacecraft. At the far end of the barrel, a gunpowder explosion is used to compress hydrogen gas to as much as 1 million times atmospheric pressure. The compressed gas gets released and sent down the launch tube, firing a projectile pellet at speeds between 7,000 and 15,000 mph. No ice particulate could survive being subjected to such massive transitory input of kinetic energy. The Ames gun was not designed for accelerating ice projectiles, so a new technology is required. Here is proposed an electrospray ice plume generator, with electrostatic acceleration.

of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence
of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation
retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals
from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial
coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument
are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products. Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the
retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and
index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information,
unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is
advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model
data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data). The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution
(regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation
estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database
provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.

* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Time Average 1-hourly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4wx4-b5xj) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

* [Nano-Particle Scandate Cathode for Space Communications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j96h-a2ee) - We propose an improved cathode based on our novel theory of the role of scandium oxide in enhancing emission in tungsten impregnate cathodes. Recent results have demonstrated the efficacy of nano-particle scandium oxide, but a detailed theory on mechanism has been lacking. Our theory explains published data and point to an optimized cathode which we here propose to build and test at our facility. The cathode is the performance limiting component in high frequency linear beam amplifiers such as traveling wave tubes and klystrons. Bandwidth, data rates, numbers of channels, frequency and output power requirements are going up. The performance of linear beam amplifiers is acutely limited by the cathode limitations. Scandate cathodes offer a way to increase emission from current limits of about 10 A/cm2 to about 50 A/cm2.
* [Digital Conically Scanned L-Band Radar, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/whqs-crjq) - The proposed effort seeks to develop a digitally steered polarimetric phased array L-Band radar utilizing a novel, high performance architecture leveraging recent advances in radio frequency and digital signal processing components. The driving methodologies are: the minimization of costly and inflexible analog circuitry, adoption of standardized manufacturing processes, and inclusion of reconfigurable software/firmware architectures to facilitate fulfillment of varied sensing requirements. The Phase II effort will build upon the successful Phase I demonstration of the system concept through fabrication of a 2 Dimensional instrument and system validation in a relevant environment.
* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Monthly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yrbk-q367) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies. The MERRA-Land product, MSTMNXMLD or tavgM_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional monthly mean at the native resolution. All collections from this group are at reduced horizontal resolution.

* [GaN Based UV Sensors for Earth Resources Management, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a74s-mmpr) - This work represents the exploitation of a unique method of crystal growth -- constrained epitaxy (CE) -- in the manufacture of low-noise, multi-color UV sensors. The sensors developed here are based on the GaN/AlGaN materials system and are sensitive in the wavelength range from 250-400nm. Target responsivities are > 0.1 A/W throughout the spectral interest range. The first arrays produced under phase 1 were sensitive both to 285 and 315 nm simultaneously. Multicolor sensitivity improves background noise rejection and provides much more detailed analysis of atmospheric aerosol scattering. Noise is dominated by diode reverse leakage and is less than 10-9A/cm2. The CE manufacturing process is enabled by the recognition that surfaces on which radiation sensitive materials are grown cannot be exposed to plasma etch effluents. To overcome this limitation, a dielectric lift-off-lithography process was developed. In this process, the growth surfaces only come in contact with organic solvents and photosensitive plastics during manufacture. Initial results were obtained on a 10 x 10 diode array. In subsequent work, we intend to produce 100 x 100 arrays. In addition, it the range of attainable spectral sensitivities will be mapped out by studying the range of achievable AlGaN stoichiometries that are practically attainable.
* [Passive Radiation Shielding: Integrating Multilayer and Multipurpose Materials into Space Habitat Design](https://data.nasa.gov/d/h4ph-uauf) - The prospect of long-term human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit poses a unique set of challenges for space habitat designers. One of those challenges is protecting astronauts from the ionizing radiation in space. On Earth, people are largely protected from that radiation by the atmosphere and the magnetic field. But beyond the natural protection mechanisms of the Earth, the space radiation environment can be dangerous for astronauts. It puts them at risk of several severe health problems, including cancer, central nervous system damage, and cataracts. Although there are several sources of ionizing radiation in space, one of the greatest causes for concern are galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). GCRs are isotropic and low in flux. They are a source of chronic radiation exposure, putting astronaut health at risk gradually over time. GCRs are mostly composed of protons and helium nuclei, but the largest concern for human health comes from their minority heavy ion component. The heavy ions in GCRs can potentially penetrate shielding and human tissue. In the interest of enabling a long-term lunar or Martian mission, the radiation protection systems should be improved to better protect against GCRs. One radiation protection method is passive shielding. A passive radiation shield is a material that is placed between a radiation source and a radiosensitive target, designed to absorb the radiation before it reaches the target. A simple example is a patient wearing a lead apron over his or her vital organs, while being exposed to X-rays at a hospital. In space, passive radiation shielding is more complicated than it sounds, because the variations in particle composition and energy spectra make it difficult to develop a catchall shield. For long-term, human-rated missions, the best material choices for passive radiation shielding tend to be multipurpose, hydrogen-rich, and have a small atomic mass. The purpose of this research is to investigate innovative passive shielding methodologies that are integrated into the design of space habitats. Specifically, this research will evaluate the feasibility of using multilayer materials, water walls, and varied habitat configurations in order to help keep astronaut radiation exposure as low as reasonably achievable. The goal is to improve the shielding efficacy against GCRs, while reducing the amount of parasitic mass required to protect the astronauts. NASA's On-Line Tool for the Assessment of Radiation in Space (OLTARIS) will be used to perform the analyses. This research directly serves to advance the fidelity of topic 6.5.3.2 in the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap, and ultimately, it aims to advance our ability to explore our solar system.
* [PHOBOS 2 MARS TERMOSKAN EDITED THERMAL/VIS IMAGING EDR V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/et5i-mqgb) - In February and March, 1989, the Termoskan instrument on board the Phobos '88 spacecraft of the USSR acquired a limited set of very high resolution simultaneous observations of the reflected solar flux (hereafter referred to as the visible channel) and emitted thermal flux (thermal infrared (IR)) from Mars's equatorial region. These are, so far, the highest spatial resolution thermal data ever obtained for Mars. Four slightly overlapping thermal panoramas (also called scans or swaths) cover a large portion of the equatorial region from 30S to 6N latitude. Simultaneous visible panoramas were taken during each of the four observing sessions; due to spacecraft memory limitations, visible channel processing was stopped early relative to the thermal channel for 2 of the sessions (2 and 4). Thus, the visible channel panoramas are shorter than the thermal panoramas for these sessions. These data are saved for historical reasons; they are not considered to be of archival quality.

* [High-Speed, Low Power 256 Channel Gamma Radiation Array Detector ASIC, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/umir-pqjz) - Building on prior success in detector electronics, we propose to design and fabricate a 256 channel readout ASIC for solid state gamma radiation array detectors having a power consumption of less 100 microW/pixel, an event detection throughput of more than 10,000 events/sec, and a dynamic range of 20-600KeV, while providing a spectral resolution of 1% or less in a footprint of less than 12 x 12 mm. This will allow the creation of high-speed 20 x 20 mm CZT detectors with 256 to 512 pixels (1 mm or less pitch). Starting with prior proven designs, we will introduce an innovative, patent-pending readout scheme that reduces digitization to only one signal per channel. We will also replace polling methods with sparse access and an innovative technique that can keep most of the pixels operating while reading out data. These innovations may increase the ASIC event detection rate by orders of magnitude while reducing system power and processing requirements. These innovations are essential for upgrading current gamma detection technology for future missions. There exists no ASICs today that can come close to achieving this performance.
* [Adaptive Flight Envelope Estimation and Protection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u6tq-cden) - Impact Technologies, in collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative flight envelope estimation and protection system for aircraft under damage upset conditions or severe flight variations. Through the integration of advanced fault detection (IVHM) algorithms, real-time system identification of the damage/faulted aircraft and flight envelop mapping, real-time decision support can be executed autonomously for improving damage tolerance and flight recoverability. The core tasks to complete of this proposed workscope include: 1) Development of a strong-tracking health identification algorithm for assessing the dynamics and performance limitation of impaired aircraft; 2) Development of the adaptive flight envelope estimation process; 3) Development of the envelope protection algorithm based on adaptive neural networks that can learn the generated online dynamic models; and 4) Demonstration of the proposed technologies under realistic flight control actuator and propulsion fault conditions. A core innovation of this program is the use of the on-line, adaptive learning neural networks that are capable of generating the dynamic models and operational envelop in real-time, which can then be used to estimate limits on the controller commands while preventing envelope exceedances. The developed techniques will be demonstrated in Phase I using an integrated aircraft model that uses the NASA MAPSS propulsion model and Generic Transport Model (GTM), with eventual demonstration using the NASA Flight Simulator at NASA Langley.

* [SCALABLE TIME SERIES CHANGE DETECTION FOR BIOMASS MONITORING USING GAUSSIAN PROCESS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i4t5-wy7d) - SCALABLE TIME SERIES CHANGE DETECTION FOR BIOMASS MONITORING USING GAUSSIAN PROCESS VARUN CHANDOLA* AND RANGA RAJU VATSAVAI* Abstract. Biomass monitoring, specifically, detecting changes in the biomass or vegetation of a geographical region, is vital for studying the carbon cycle of the system and has significant implications in the context of understanding climate change and its impacts. Recently, several time series change detection methods have been proposed to identify land cover changes in temporal profiles (time series) of vegetation collected using remote sensing instruments. In this paper, we adapt Gaussian process regression to detect changes in such time series in an online fashion. While Gaussian process (GP) has been widely used as a kernel based learning method for regression and classification, their applicability to massive spatio-temporal data sets, such as remote sensing data, has been limited owing to the high computational costs involved. In our previous work we proposed an efficient Toeplitz matrix based solution for scalable GP parameter estimation. In this paper we apply these solutions to a GP based change detection algorithm. The proposed change detection algorithm requires a memory footprint which is linear in the length of the input time series and runs in time which is quadratic to the length of the input time series. Experimental results show that both serial and parallel implementations of our proposed method achieve significant speedups over the serial implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed change detection method in identifying changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data.
* [Privacy Preserving Outlier Detection through Random Nonlinear Data Distortion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hdqp-dua8) - Consider a scenario in which the data owner has some private/sensitive data and wants a data miner to access it for studying important patterns without revealing the sensitive information. Privacy preserving data mining aims to solve this problem by randomly transforming the data prior to its release to data miners. Previous work only considered the case of linear data perturbations — additive, multiplicative or a combination of both for studying the usefulness of the perturbed output. In this paper, we discuss nonlinear data distortion using potentially nonlinear random data transformation and show how it can be useful for privacy preserving anomaly detection from sensitive datasets. We develop bounds on the expected accuracy of the nonlinear distortion and also quantify privacy by using standard definitions. The highlight of this approach is to allow a user to control the amount of privacy by varying the degree of nonlinearity. We show how our general transformation can be used for anomaly detection in practice for two specific problem instances: a linear model and a popular nonlinear model using the sigmoid function. We also analyze the proposed nonlinear transformation in full generality and then show that for specific cases it is distance preserving. A main contribution of this paper is the discussion between the invertibility of a transformation and privacy preservation and the application of these techniques to outlier detection. Experiments conducted on real-life datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
* [Towards a Framework for Evaluating and Comparing Diagnosis Algorithms](https://data.nasa.gov/d/27y3-jxaq) - Diagnostic inference involves the detection of anomalous system behavior and the identification of its cause, possibly down to a failed unit or to a parameter of a failed unit. Traditional approaches to solving this problem include expert/rule-based, model-based, and data-driven methods. Each approach (and various techniques within each approach) use different representations of the knowledge required to perform the diagnosis. The sensor data is expected to be combined with these internal representations to produce the diagnosis result. In spite of the availability of various diagnosis technologies, there have been only minimal efforts to develop a standardized software framework to run, evaluate, and compare different diagnosis technologies on the same system. This paper presents a framework that defines a standardized representation of the system knowledge, the sensor data, and the form of the diagnosis results – and provides a run-time architecture that can execute diagnosis algorithms, send sensor data to the algorithms at appropriate time steps from a variety of sources (including the actual physical system), and collect resulting diagnoses. We also define a set of metrics that can be used to evaluate and compare the performance of the algorithms, and provide software to calculate the metrics.

Based on the acquired knowledge, nominal/off-nominal physics models and prognostic health management algorithms were developed. In order to aid with development of the algorithms and validate them on realistic data, a testbed capable of supporting experiments in both laboratory and flight environment was developed. Test actuators with architectures similar to potential flight-certified units were obtained for the purposes of testing and realistic fault injection methods were designed. Several hundred fault scenarios were created, using permutations of position and load profiles, as well as fault severity levels. The diagnostic system was tested extensively on these scenarios, with the test results demonstrating high accuracy and low numbers of false positive and false negative diagnoses. The prognostic system was utilized to track fault progression in some of the fault scenarios, predicting the remaining useful life of the actuator. A series of run-to-failure experiments were conducted to validate its performance, with the resulting error in predicting time to failure generally lesser than 10% error. While a more robust validation procedure would require dozens more experiments executed under the same conditions (and, consequently, more test articles destroyed), the current results already demonstrate the potential for predicting fault progression in this type of devices. More prognostic experiments are planned for the next phase of this work, including investigation and comparison of other prognostic algorithms (such as various types of Particle Filter and GPR), addition of new fault types, and execution of prognostic experiments in flight environment.
* [Precision Membrane Optical Shell (PMOS) Technology for RF/Microwave to Lightweight LIDAR Apertures, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/h8ud-94p8) - Membrane Optical Shell Technology (MOST) is an innovative combination of 1) very low areal density (40 to 200g/m2) optically smooth (<20 nm rms), metallic coated reflective membrane thin films, 2) advanced fabrication techniques that transform the films into self supporting shells through the introduction of permanent optically relevant double curvature, and 3) discrete active boundary control to enable rigid body alignment and maintainment of surface figure in face of environmental disturbances. Areal densities of better than 2 kg/m2 (including actuators) are projected. Current measured surface figure is &#8776;1 to 10 microns rms at up to the 15 cm size, and we are poised for further improvements. Demonstrated material and fabrication techniques are scaleable to at least the 2m+ diameter single surface apertures and larger apertures are possible through segmentation techniques. Proven stowage and deployment techniques enable space flight application. We propose advancing 1) the basic fabrication technology and 2) the TRL level of MOST apertures for ground and space based apertures. The key resulting innovation is implementation of low areal density, compact roll stowable approaches to realize low mass, low cost reflective apertures for RF/Microwave to LIDAR. Other NASA and DOD applications are expected as precision and aperture size increase.
* [Prognostics Enhanced Reconfigurable Control of Electro-Mechanical Actuators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ivck-kxtd) - Actuator systems are employed widely in aerospace, transportation and industrial processes to provide power to critical loads, such as aircraft control surfaces. They must operate reliably and accurately in order for the vehicle / process to complete successfully its designated mission. Incipient actuator failure conditions may severely endanger the operational integrity of the vehicle / process and compromise its mission. The ability to maintain a stable and credible operation, even in the presence of incipient failures, is of paramount importance to accomplish “must achieve” mission objectives. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the fault-tolerant design of critical subsystems, such as an ElectroMechanical Actuator (EMA), that takes advantage of on-line, real-time estimates of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) or Time-to-Failure (TTF) of a failing component and reconfigures the available control authority by trading off system performance with control activity. The primary goal is to complete critical mission objectives within a time window dictated by prognostic algorithms so that the fault mode is accommodated and an acceptable level of performance maintained for the duration of the mission. The proposed fault-tolerant control design is mathematically rigorous, generic and applicable to a variety of application domains. An EMA is used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.
* [LBA-ECO LC-18 Hyperion 30-m Surface Reflectance, Mato Grosso, Brazil: July 2004](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wz9h-5qhw) - This image was collected by the Hyperion sensor on 10-July-2004 at 13:16:16 GMT. It was calibrated to apparent surface reflectance using the ACORN atmospheric model.The Hyperion imager has a spectral range of 400-2500 nm, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, spatial resolution of 30 m, and a swath width of 7.8 km. Sampling is scene based (256 samples, 512 lines) (http://eo1.usgs.gov/sensors.php). Through these large number of spectral bands, complex land ecosystems can be imaged and accurately classified.Data from the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer may greatly increase our ability to estimate the presence and structural attributes of selective logging in the Amazon Basin using four biogeophysical indicators not yet derived simultaneously from any satellite sensor: 1) green canopy leaf area index; 2) degree of shadowing; 3) presence of exposed soil and; 4) non-photosynthetic vegetation material. Airborne, field and modeling studies have shown that the optical reflectance continuum (400-2500 nm) contains sufficient information to derive estimates of each of these indicators. Our ongoing studies in the eastern Amazon basin also suggest that these four indicators are sensitive to logging intensity. Satellite-based estimates of these indicators should provide a means to quantify both the presence and degree of structural disturbance caused by various logging regimes.
* [Live-Axis Turning for the Fabrication of Non-Rotationally Symmetric Optics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9gz5-nq8u) - The goal of this proposal is to develop a new method to create Non-Rotationally Symmetric (NRS) surfaces that overcomes the limitations of the current techniques and is fast, accurate and inexpensive. Diamond turning (DT) has revolutionized the fabrication of lightweight optical surfaces for defense and science applications such as forward-looking infrared radar and infrared spectrometers. It has made this impact not only because it can accurately and rapidly fabricate diffractive, refractive and reflective optical surfaces, but because it can create reference features tied to the optical surfaces to guarantee optical alignment. An emerging trend in optical design is the use of NRS surfaces that reduce complexity, bulk and weight. To create these surfaces, DT machines have been modified with a low-amplitude Fast Tool Servo, a third axis or a fly-cutter. The problem with the FTS is its limited range and the other techniques are plagued by thermal drift during long fabrication times. The proposed Live Axis Turning (LAT) process combines evolving technologies of air bearings, linear motors, high-resolution encoders and high-speed control systems into a moving lightweight toolpost on a conventional DT machine. The result is a more flexible machine that can increase production and reduce cost for NRS components.
* [LBA-ECO LC-39 MODIS Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mrn5-wyn7) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides active fire locations and estimates of annual fire frequencies for South America from 2000-2007. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm. There are 14 data files with this data set: 7 GeoTIFF (.tif) files of fire frequency at MODIS 250 m resolution, where each grid cell value represents the number of days in that year on which active fires were detected, and 7 shape files of active fire locations for the years 2001-2007.
* [Development of a Low-SWAP, RAD-Tolerant, Thermally Stable, 10Gbps per Channel Fiber Optic Transceiver for Harsh Environment Networking Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jaum-bq5c) - According to the NASA Topic S3, "the Science Mission Directorate will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our Solar System and beyond. SMD's future direction will be moving from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns), that would require new vantage points, or that would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. The demand for larger area coverage, higher resolution and multi-spectral capability in satellite remote sensing applications, and the demand for higher data rates in digital satellite communications networks continue to place ever increasing demands on onboard data handling and processing subsystems - 1 Gbps to 4 Gbps data rates are not uncommon and continually increasing. Further, satellite subsystems must be capable of reliable operation in the space radiation environment and will continue to be constrained by SWAP limitations. Shrinking development budgets and rapid development requirements are driving onboard data handling networks toward more flexible, non-proprietary architectures and interface standardization. Therefore, SPI proposes to develop a 10Gbps per channel optical transceiver and mating, multi-channel reprogrammable network interface card (NIC) that are RAD-tolerant to over 300KRad-Si TID, operate reliably from -25C to 85C. Further, the NIC will be fully reprogrammable such that it may be reconfigured and utilized as an optical router, switch, or multi-protocol compatible gateway.
* [Experimental Data Collection and Modeling for Nominal and Fault Conditions on Electro-Mechanical Actuators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2nya-d59e) - Being relatively new to the field, electromechanical actuators in aerospace applications lack the knowledge base compared to ones accumulated for the other actuator types, especially when it comes to fault detection and characterization. Lack of health monitoring data from fielded systems and prohibitive costs of carrying out real flight tests push for the need of building system models and designing affordable but realistic experimental setups. This paper presents our approach to accomplish a comprehensive test environment equipped with fault injection and data collection capabilities. Efforts also include development of multiple models for EMA operations, both in nominal and fault conditions that can be used along with measurement data to generate effective diagnostic and prognostic estimates. A detailed description has been provided about how various failure modes are inserted in the test environment and corresponding data is collected to verify the physics based models under these failure modes that have been developed in parallel. A design of experiment study has been included to outline the details of experimental data collection. Furthermore, some ideas about how experimental results can be extended to real flight environments through actual flight tests and using real flight data have been presented. Finally, the roadmap leading from this effort towards developing successful prognostic algorithms for electromechanical actuators is discussed.*
* [Thermally-Stable High Strain Deployable Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kc4e-swqs) - The proposed innovation is for the development of a thermally-stable composite made of carbon fibers and elastomeric resin. This combination of materials will allow a composite with higher stiffness and strain compared with materials currently in use for space. The significance of this innovation is that the proposed material will enable more capable deployable structures, minimize complexity, mass, and cost. Specifically the work done in Phase I and Phase II will enable cost effective components and subsystem technologies for flight systems, such as large sunshields and external occulters in Phase III. The objective of this project will be to develop technologies and methods that improve the design, fabrication, modeling, inspection, and testing of composite materials for space deployable structures. This includes methods of testing and modeling/characterization of the material in order to guide its formulation. The characterization of the new elastomeric composite will be accomplished through a series of standardized tests, supported by non-standard tests as required.
* [Fiber Optic Acoustic Emission system for structural health monitoring of Composite Pressure Vessels, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3ycn-e6w5) - Pressurized systems and pressure vessels used in NASA ground-based and flight-based applications including fuel tanks, composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs), and composite tankage commonly suffer from several types of degradation including fatigue, cracking, lack of bonding, and leakage. Veraphotonics proposes to develop a pressure vessel leak and damage detection system. In a large vessel, in-line inspection using health-monitoring sensors would provide structural integrity assessment, reduce maintenance, and eliminate potential points of failure. Acoustic Emission (AE) method is the most prevalent method that provides continuous monitoring for leak and damage detection as well as estimates the location of leak or damage in pressure vessels. In this SBIR Phase I project, the feasibility of a novel laser-based interrogation technique AE method for the detection of leak and damages in liquid-filled vessel instrumented with FBG sensors will be performed in laboratory and field vessels including COPVs. Based on laboratory and field test measurements, we will optimize the FBG sensors and the system to reduce or eliminate the acoustic background noise from the vessel environment. In Phase II all the FBG sensors will be integrated on a single optical fiber and interrogated using a compact, battery powered interrogation device with wireless data transmission capability.

* [High Resolution Autostereoscopic Cockpit Display, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nycg-tnd2) - The utility of stereoscopic 3D image representation in many applications is now well established. It is not just a matter of stereo being better than 2D, but of stereo being necessary to interpret representations of complex data sets, physical phenomena, engineering designs and position in space. The US Air Force has long recognized the potential for 3D displays in the cockpit but until now the limitations of 3D display technology have prevented implementation. Interest in 3D image display has recently surfaced among SPAWAR and among agencies who use helicopters and firms that make camera systems for helicopters for use in power line inspection, law enforcement, and military applications. There is also interest in the use of plane mounted cameras in collision avoidance while taxiing on runways, where 3D display may be of benefit because it can show the pilot how much room there is between the plane and obstacles. 3D displays for these applications must be of the glasses free type, but current embodiments of such displays possess extremely low resolution, produce visual artifacts, and tend to produce very narrow viewing areas. Under a recent DOE SBIR Phase II contract DTI developed a new glasses free 2D/3D switchable display that avoids the resolution loss, visual artifacts, and viewing restrictions associated with all other autostereoscopic displays, providing full HD resolution in 3D as well as in a 2D viewing mode. DTI's believes that this new technology can lead to the first practical implementation of a 3D display in the cockpit. During this Phase I program DTI will investigate the adaptation of its 2D/3D displays to cockpit displays through compact design, ruggedizing, and the development of mechanical, electronic, computer, and software interfaces to an aircraft system. This investigation will lead to a high level design and specification for a prototype display that can developed in Phase II and delivered for testing in a cockpit or simulator.
* [Global Annual Average PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/d5b9-96tw) - Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data set represents a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data. Together the grids provide a continuous surface of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. The satellite AOD retrievals were converted to ground-level concentrations based on a conversion factor developed by researchers at Dalhousie University that accounts for spatial and temporal variations in aerosol properties and vertical structure as derived from a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 30 arc-minutes (0.5 degree or approximately 50 sq. km at the equator) and cover the world from 70 degrees N to 60 degrees S latitude. The grids were produced by researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute in collaboration with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network/Columbia University under a NASA-ROSES project entitled "Using Satellite Data to Develop Environmental Indicators: An Application of NASA Data Products to Support High Level Decisions for National and International Environmental Protection". Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature death as well as increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease, especially in the elderly, young children, and those already suffering from these illnesses. The World Health Organization guideline for PM2.5 average annual exposure is less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms per cubic meter, whereas the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) primary standard is less than or equal to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA primary standards are designed to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.

* [PowerCube: Integrated Power, Propulsion, and Pointing for CubeSats, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cs23-8in8) - The PowerCube is a 1U CubeSat module that provides integrated propulsion, power, and precision pointing to enable the low-cost CubeSat platform to be used to conduct high-performance missions. The PowerCube concept integrates three innovative component technologies to provide these capabilities: First, a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) water-electrolysis fuel cell supplies gH2/gO2 to a simple pressure-fed thruster to provide 300 Ns of impulse per 100 mL of water. This approach enables the CubeSat to launch with 'inert' propellant to comply with P-POD limitations on stored energy and then process the water on-orbit into high-Isp fuel. Second, a deployable solar array that stows along the long sides of the CubeSat and deploys in a 'windmill' configuration provides up to 96 W peak. Third, a 3DOF 'carpal-wrist' gimbal, in conjunction with magnetic torque coils, enables sun-tracking of the solar panel, vectoring of the thruster, and precision pointing of payloads. The combination of ample power and water electrolysis will provide up to 6 m/s of delta-V per 90 minute orbit for a 3U CubeSat. Compared to other CubeSat propulsion technologies, the PowerCube thruster will enable more rapid orbital maneuvering and significantly lower contamination issues. Our Phase I effort developed a detailed baseline design for the PowerCube, and built and tested a proof-of-concept prototype of the water-electrolysis thruster. The Phase II effort will mature the electrolysis thruster component to the engineering model level, develop and simulate methods for attitude control and precise pointing of both panels and payloads using the gimbal and torque coils, and develop a detailed design for the entire PowerCube module to enable flight validation in follow-on Phase III efforts.

This IRAD project will complete a preliminary thermal and ground cooling system design of the CHRS system and also perform a radiation transmission test with potential CHRS tank materials.</p> <p>The objectives of this IRAD study are to perform the preliminary thermal system design and optimization of the CHRS system and to perform radiation testings of samples of materials that are candidates for containing the hydrogen in the CHRS.</p><p>The previous study of the concept proposed a potential CHRS geometry. We can meet the thermal design&nbsp;requirements by using proper cryogenic thermal management techniques. Various design&nbsp;options will be investigated for the fluid management system.

High energy protons and nuclei ions from Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) can result in radiation doses that are dangerous to astronaut health and even survivability if the astronauts are not adequately shielded. The high energy particles also cause significant amounts of secondary radiation when they impinge on Aluminum, which is commonly used for spacecraft structure. The secondary neutron radiation may cause human radiogenic cancers. Hydrogen or hydrogen rich materials are ideal materials for radiation shielding because of hydrogen does not easily break down to form secondary radiation source.</p><p>A &nbsp;CHRS concept study was conducted by the Cryogenics and Fluids Branch in FY08.

* [A New Approach to Uncertainty Reduction in Launch Vehicle Compartment Venting](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dqet-7af5) - <p>Launch vehicle compartments are vented to the external environment during ascent to minimize undesirable structural loading. Prediction of venting performance is an essential element of launch vehicle design and mission development. However, because of complex interactions between the vent flow and the high-speed external flow, there is substantial uncertainty in those predictions. This limitation results in unnecessary vehicle structural mass (reducing payload mass) and increased risk of vehicle or payload loss or damage from structural failure or malfunction. The focus of this project is a novel vent concept offering more predictable performance.</p> <p>Launch vehicle compartments (e.g. interstage, fairings, payload shroud, etc.) are vented to the external flow during ascent to relieve the internal pressure as the external pressure falls. Vents are openings between the internal compartment and the external environment. They can range in configuration from simple &quot;holes&quot; (orifices) in the vehicle skin to substantially more complicated arrangements. The objectives of the venting system are to minimize adverse differential-pressure loading of the vehicle skin, prevent ingestion of hot gas from the external boundary-layer, and control the compartment depressurization rate to avoid payload damage and ensure proper shroud separation. These requirements are often conflicting, creating a complex design situation where too much venting can be worse than too little.</p><p>A transient venting analysis is conducted during vehicle development to determine suitable vent sizes &amp; locations and the resulting structural loads. The present state of the art in venting analysis and design is based on a legacy capability (developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s) that is less than ideal. One known deficiency is that the level of uncertainty in the prediction of vent performance is significant. This uncertainty has costs associated with it. One is that the vehicle structure is over-conservative to account for uncertainty in the predicted skin loads, resulting in an unnecessary reduction in payload capacity. Another cost is the increased risk of damage or malfunction&nbsp;that compromises mission objectives (e.g. 1973 Saturn-V/Skylab-1) or catastrophic failure resulting in vehicle/payload loss. During the 1990s, there was a series of Long March shroud separation failures that were attributed to venting. Recent unexplained shroud separation failures may also be venting related.</p><p>While the prediction of launch vehicle compartment venting involves a number of inputs, and corresponding sources of uncertainty, it depends to a large extent on the precision with which the flow characteristics of the vents are known. Unfortunately, the fluid mechanics of a vent discharging into a high-speed cross-flow is extremely complex and not well understood. Consequently, the prediction of vent performance relies on empirically derived discharge coefficients. Such data for compressible cross-flow conditions are extremely limited. Moreover, these data exhibit large variations in measured cross-flow discharge coefficient for supposedly identical test conditions. The inconsistencies may be due to unsteadiness, hysteresis, bi-stable phenomena, and/or experimental error. The deficiencies in the available data are presently handled by setting upper and lower limits to bound the observed vent flow characteristics. However, those limits differ by a factor of five in some cases. Another problem is that the experimental data are restricted to idealized vent geometries (i.e. a sharp-edged orifice in a thin plate). How well these data represent the performance of real flight-configuration vents (which can include ducting pathways, screens, rain shields, one-way valves, etc.) is an open question.</p><p>The focus of this project is a novel vent concept offering more predictable performance.</p>
* [Global Annual Average PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9ngx-pgpc) - Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data sets represent a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data. Together the grids provide a continuous surface of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. The satellite AOD retrievals were converted to ground-level concentrations based on a conversion factor developed by researchers at Dalhousie University that accounts for spatial and temporal variations in aerosol properties and vertical structure as derived from a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 30 arc-minutes (0.5 degree or approximately 50 sq. km at the equator) and cover the world from 70°N to 60°S latitude. The grids were produced by researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute in collaboration with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network/Columbia University under a NASA-ROSES project entitled "Using Satellite Data to Develop Environmental Indicators: An Application of NASA Data Products to Support High Level Decisions for National and International Environmental Protection". Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature death as well as increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease, especially in the elderly, young children, and those already suffering from these illnesses. The World Health Organization guideline for PM2.5 average annual exposure is less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms per cubic meter, whereas the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) primary standard is less than or equal to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA primary standards are designed to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.
* [Next Generation Microshutter Arrays Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f85i-p44p) - We propose to develop the next generation MicroShutter Array (MSA) as a multi-object field selector for missions anticipated in the next two decades. For many applications, this field selector improves instrument efficiency proportionally to the number of shutters opened simultaneously. We have successfully developed and built the JWST microshutter array system, which increases the observing efficiency of the Near Infrared Spectrometer by two orders of magnitude. As a result of this development, there is a significant scientific demand for these devices for space-based and ground based applications. The availability of large format microshutters can significantly increase the scientific reach of spectroscopic survey instrument such as WFIRST and future missions such as ATLAST. The basic design of the JWST MSA cannot be extended to such a large scales due to the design limitations set by the required magnetic actuation. We have recently demonstrated shutter operation using DC plus AC resonant pumping. The breakthrough demonstrates that we are able to eliminate bulky permanent magnets used for JWST MSA actuation, thus opening an avenue to create a very large focal plane field selector that can be built at much lower cost. in this program, we will fabricate electrostatically actuated microshutter arrays and demonstrate their performance for use as UV, visible, and infrared field selectors.

* [High Efficiency Three Phase Resonant Conversion for Standardized Architecture Power System Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4e9g-jcuk) - A low-cost, standardized-architecture power system is proposed for NASA electric propulsion (EP) applications. Three approaches are combined to develop a system that will meet current and future NASA needs and exceed currently available power processor unit (PPU) performance in terms of electrical efficiency, specific mass (kg/kW), and cost. The approaches include the use of (a) high-efficiency, 3-phase, dc-dc converters to minimize cooling requirements, mass, and parts count and maximize reliability and efficiency, (b) modularized and standardized sub-system design and fabrication techniques to accommodate power output scaling and re-configuration for specific ion thruster designs without the need to re-qualify hardware, and (c) attention to cost and manufacturability issues that will allow the implementation of electric propulsion systems on future NASA missions without the hidden costs of "hard-to-build" and "hard-to-scale" designs that are currently available. The innovations proposed herein will allow NASA to obtain the flexibility and performance it needs in power processors for electric propulsion systems while ensuring that their cost and difficulty of fabrication is low.
* [Thermal Protection Systems Nondestructive Evaluation Tool, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7k4c-6uue) - Based on the successful feasibility demonstration in Phase I, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to continue the development of a novel Thermal Protection System Nondestructive Evaluation Tool (THRON), which addresses NASA's need for evaluation of lightweight rigid and/or flexible ablative materials, and provides noncontact, one-sided in situ operation for accurate detection, identification, and precise spatial localization and measurements of internal and surface defects/voids, and evaluation of bondlines and in-depth integrity of such materials and also large-area multilayer thermal protection system (TPS) structures with complex geometries. THRON is based on POC-patented X-ray Compton imaging tomography and POC-patented apodized coded aperture X-ray imaging optics, substantially modified and optimized to meet NASA's requirements. The THRON Phase I prototype demonstrated excellent potential for detection and spatial localization of defects/voids with dimensions <6 mm by 6 mm by 6 mm, and bondline defects <12 mm by 12 mm by 200 &#956;m in TPS material and structures. At the end of Phase II, POC will perform a technology readiness level (TRL)-6 demonstration of THRON in POC's X-ray lab and/or at NASA facilities, and will deliver to NASA a working engineering model of an effective NDE tool.
* [VEGA1 INFRARED SPECTROMETER IMAGING CHANNEL DATA V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/68h3-s9kp) - The IKS data from Vega-1 came in various forms. The initial submission from IKI by Dyachkov was in GROUP FITS (binary) for the 'imaging channel'. A separate submission came through the IHW Infrared Studies Discipline and also contained data presented in the FITS format (IHW keywords) for the two 'infrared channels'. In the former case, the three Pvalues carried information on the distance and two angles used to locate the position of the comet on the slit. The other simple keyword values marked only the date, mission, and experiment. The latter data, had not only 101 individual spectra for the 3-5 micron measurements but a composite 'final' 6-12 micron spectrum with associated 'figure 7' from the published results (COMBES, M. et al. 1988, Icarus, 76, 404). For these 101 spectra a cometo-centric distance was quoted rather than a time micron data. Using this information, the distance range was 270534.9 to 39273.22 km. From this comparison, it is inferred that the distance quoted in the IKI submission is also cometo-centric (31596.0 to 16092 km).
* [Innovative Development of Kernel-Based Reduced-Order Models for Predicting LCO Onset, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g8i2-i62i) - Reducing uncertainty in the prediction of limit cycle oscillations (LCO) and other nonlinear aeroservoelastic phenomena is critical to flight safety. To do so requires nonlinear methods. First-principles based methods (CFD/CSD) have made considerable progress but still cannot predict LCO from the outset. NEAR proposes the development of two innovative nonlinear data-based methods to characterize aeroservoelastic systems using flight-test data. The proposed methods provide a natural extension of existing linear methods, provide uncertainty estimates of the prediction, and are applicable to flight-test data. Both approaches are formally related. However, their practical implementations place various limitations on the physics they represent. The Phase I effort will document, on a benchmark test case, the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Phase II will further develop the most promising approach and demonstrate its use on flight-test data, such as data from the F18-AAW. Special emphasis will be placed on the problem of data generalization across flight conditions, which is key to ensuring safe and efficient envelope-expansion flight testing.

* [SMEX03 Airborne GPS Bistatic Radar Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/b32m-a5gv) - This data set contains measurements of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals reflected from the Earths surface and collected on an airborne platform. The measurements were taken over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) regional study areas of Brazil and Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA. The primary objective was to collect land reflections for sensitivity of the reflected GPS power to temporal and spatial soil moisture and foliage attenuation. The measurements are a form of bistatic radar and can be used to estimate the surface scattering coefficient, such as roughness and/or dielectric properties, as well as path delays between the direct and reflected GPS signals. Scattering coefficients can then be used to estimate changes in surface soil moisture. The reflections collected were from agricultural land in Brazil, Alabama, and Georgia, along with grassland in Oklahoma. Data were collected on 24, 25, 27, 30 June 2003 and 2, 3, 5, 7, 12-15, 17, 18 July 2003.

* [LBA-ECO CD-32 LBA Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-MIP) Forcing Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uicw-jywy) - This data set provides gap-filled meteorological observations from nine Brazilian flux towers for periods between 1999 and 2006. The measurements include: air temperature, specific humidity, module of wind speed, downward long wave and shortwave radiation at the surface, surface pressure, precipitation, and carbon dioxide (CO2). These atmospheric data are provided at 1 hour time-steps. These data were used as the standardized forcing data input for the LBA Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-MIP).The LBA-MIP goal was to gain comparative understanding of ecosystem models that simulate energy, water, and CO2 fluxes over the LBA area. The task was to subject all the models to the same forcing and experimental protocol, and to compare the outputs. The protocol is provided as a companion file, lba_mip_protocol4.0_20100309.pdf.The source meteorological observations for the forcing data, from the nine Brazilian flux towers, were recently published as Saleska, et al.

* [Hybrid Heat Pipes for High Heat Flux Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2nnh-n32f) - The thermal transport requirements for future spacecraft missions continue to increase, approaching several kilowatts. At the same time the heat acquisition areas have trended downward, thereby increasing the incident heat flux. Current incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2. This is a severe limitation for axial groove aluminum/ammonia constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs). The maximum heat flux in a CCHP is set by the boiling limit, which typically start at 5 W/cm2 for axial grove wicks, and 20-30 W/cm2 for powder metal wicks. The innovation is to develop CCHPs with a hybrid wick, which has a sintered evaporator wick, and a conventional grooved adiabatic and condenser wick. These hybrid wicks can operate at higher heat fluxes, allowing the use of higher power laser diodes. They also allow the use of Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) in Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, which must operate at tilts up to 45°. Conventional aluminum/ammonia heat pipes can only operate with a 0.1 inch tilt, so they are unsuitable. Loop Heat Pipes can also operate with tilting, but they are two orders of magnitude more expensive. A hybrid grooved and sintered wick CCHP will allow operating at higher heat fluxes as compared to axial groove design and can also operate against gravity on the planetary surface, operate in space, carrying power over long distances, act as a thermosyphon on the planetary surface for Lunar and Martian landers and rovers, and demonstrate a higher transport capability than an all-sintered wick.

* [Long-wave Infrared Detectors for the Planetary Infrared Spectrometers](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g86w-ua2d) - <p>Understanding the role of primitive bodies as building blocks for planets and life are key targets for space exploration. Chemical and mineralogical characterizations are critical components of this exploration. Infrared spectrometers provide a new spectroscopic capability to interrogate the feature-rich region of long-wave infrared. The objective of this work was to develop high performance in house long-wave barrier (8 &mu;m) infrared (LWIR) detectors tailored for the use in planetary spectrometers for characterization of primitive bodies.</p> <p>Currently, the major impediment for long wavelength instrumentation is the availability of sensitive detectors that can cover the region of interest &ndash; wavelengths up to approximately 7.5 &mu;m (or wavenumbers less than &asymp; 1330 cm1). Long-wave limits of current and recent spectrometers are 3 &mu;m (M3), 3.92 &mu;m (CRISM), and 5.1 &mu;m (VIMS). While useful for hydrides (and nitriles, CO, and CO2 for VIMS), these limited ranges are unsuitable for detection and characterization of most molecules and minerals of planetary interest and especially organic molecules. As an example, while the C-H stretch band in the 3-&mu;m region can indicate the presence of hydrocarbons, this band is not indicative of the type of chemical or functional group, i. e. alcohols, organic acids, esters, etc. Identification of these molecules requires information from other (and stronger) transitions occurring at longer wavelengths. Detection of such spectra in remote-sensing or in situ applications often requires high sensitivity long-IR detectors, particularly for diffusely reflected sunlight in outer solar system measurements. The high-quality detectors generally required for space and astronomical detectors were originally developed for the military, with the cut-off wavelengths chosen to match spectral transmission windows of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere (below 5 &mu;m for mid-IR and above 10 &mu;m for long-IR regions). Consequently, detectors with cut-off wavelengths between 5 and 10 &mu;m have never been produced in quantity and are not available except expensive custom items (multi million dollars) by external vendors. The unknown detector performance of external vendors such as environmental/planet radiation increases the risk of using detectors from external providers and increases the instrument cost to verify these components under these conditions. Therefore, the costs of such detectors are in the millions of dollar range with lead times longer than one year. This is a major driver in the overall cost of spectroscopic planetary instruments and poses a significant risk to the timely and successful delivery of the instruments. Therefore, the development of an in-house detector capability at the target 8 &mu;m wavelength with a route towards integration into planetary spectrometers takes away the risk and cost associated with external vendors and will make JPL&rsquo;s planetary instruments extremely competitive.</p>
* [Automated Service Discovery using Autonomous Control Technologies, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hjc4-2yqs) - With the advent of mobile commerce technologies, the realization of pervasive computing and the formation of ad-hoc networks can be leveraged to the benefit of the NASA Spaceports in several technical areas. The Automated Service Discovery (ASD) architecture will allow a portable real-time Expert System to be used to aid in the Service Discovery, management of communications links, and fault detection isolation and recovery for vehicle health management. The ASD system will allow significant cost reductions for fielding and maintaining systems at the Spaceports. Flight systems can save weight by relying on encrypted wireless links rather than connections to a wiring harness for data transfer. Ground based systems can reconfigure on the fly using wireless and connection oriented ad-hoc networks. This proposal also addresses the need for a standardized command, control and monitor system for ground and space infrastructure. ASD will use the same Expert System for execution of the ASD algorithms to derive suggestions for least-cost paths for data connectivity. The ASD system will provide a capability for the real-time Expert System to query for service capabilities and adjust goals and constraints based on available resources. The ASD implementation will be machine, language, and operating system neutral.
* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jwm3-dnmz) - ABSTRACT: The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. FASIR-NDVI data are also used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface. There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.
* [Intelligent Flamefinder Detection and Alert System (IFDAS), Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/svtp-cpga) - Current hydrogen flame detection systems exhibit shortcomings ranging from limited detection range, to localization inaccuracy, limited sensitivity, false alarms, and inability to self-diagnose failures. During Phase I. International Electronic Machines Corporation IEM created and tested a prototype version of an Intelligent FlameFinder Detection and Alert System (IFDAS), demonstrating that IEM's system could accurately detect, track, and localize hydrogen flames and reliably discriminate between hydrogen flames and over two dozen sources of false alarms including reflections of flames or the sun, welding, other flame sources, etc., using a unique, innovative, and expandable Flame Detection Expert System design. In Phase II, IEM proposes to develop a full working prototype system employing multiple IFDAS sensor units, an enhanced flame detection expert system, and a comprehensive user interface including means for notifying emergency personnel when a fire is detected. This IFDAS Prototype will be demonstrated under real-world conditions at Stennis Space Center.
* [The Case for Software Health Management](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a5ij-6vyn) - Software Health Management (SWHM) is a new field that is concerned with the development of tools and technologies to enable automated detection, diagnosis, prediction, and mitigation of adverse events due to software anomalies. Significant effort has been expended in the last several decades in the development of verification and validation methods for software intensive systems, but it is becoming increasingly more apparent that this is not enough to guarantee that a complex software system meets all safety and reliability requirements. Modern software systems can exhibit a variety of failure modes which can go undetected in a verification and validation process. While standard techniques for error handling, fault detection and isolation can have significant benefits for many systems, it is becoming increasingly evident that new technologies and methods are necessary for the development of techniques to detect, diagnose, predict, and then mitigate the adverse events due to software that has already undergone significant verification and validation procedures. These software faults often arise due to the interaction between the software and the operating environment. Unanticipated environmental changes lead to software anomalies that may have significant impact on the overall success of the mission. Because software is ubiquitous, it is not sufficient that errors are detected only after they occur. Rather, software must be instrumented and monitored for failures before they happen. This prognostic capability will yield safer and more dependable systems for the future. This paper addresses the motivation, needs, and requirements of software health management as a new discipline. Published in the Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology, Palo Alto, CA, August 2011.

The standardized ProPACS system integrates the essential elements needed for highly capable micro-spacecraft bus including; 1) 600 W Hall effect thruster system for primary propulsion, 2) Xe cold gas thrusters for propulsive ACS, 3) articulated solar array, batteries and power management and distribution (PMAD) system with steady state power of 700W available to the payload when propulsion is off and 4) an integral structure that supports the payload and a LightBand separation mechanism for the ESPA ring. The ProPACS can provide over 1,800 m/sec deltaV to a 181 kg spacecraft with a 80kg payload. In Phase 1 ProPACS system architecture design was completed and all major components were identified. Mass, power, data budgets were developed and major interfaces were specified. Phase 2 focus will be on the ProPACS elements with lower TRL to achieve system wide TRL6 at the end of the program. The thruster will be advanced to near flight level, two PMAD systems will be evaluated and one selected and the ProPACS integral structure supporting the payload and separation ring will be designed and built.
* [LBA-ECO LC-39 MODIS Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6eut-cjkc) - This data set, Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment (LBA-ECO) LC-39 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007, provides active fire locations and estimates of annual fire frequencies. Data from the MODIS sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm.

* [NACP MsTMIP: Global and North American Driver Data for Multi-Model Intercomparison](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bnde-mmt8) - This data set provides environmental data that have been standardized and aggregated for use as input to carbon cycle models at global (0.5-degree resolution) and regional (North America at 0.25-degree resolution) scales. The data were compiled from selected sources (Table 2) and integrated into gridded global and regional collections of climatology variables (precipitation, air temperature, air specific humidity, air relative humidity (NA only), pressure, downward longwave radiation, downward shortwave radiation, and wind speed), time-varying atmospheric CO2 concentrations, time-varying nitrogen deposition, biome fraction and type, land-use and land-cover change, C3/C4 grasses fractions, major crop distribution, phenology, multiple soil characteristics, and a land-water mask. The temporal ranges of the data are sufficient for carbon cycle model simulations from 1801 to 2010. These data were compiled specifically for the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Multi-Scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) as the prescribed model input driver data (Huntzinger et al., 2013). The driver data were used by 22 terrestrial biosphere models to run baseline and sensitivity simulations. The standardized data provided consistent model inputs to minimize the inter-model variability caused by differences in environmental drivers and initial conditions. Together with the sensitivity simulations, the standardized input data enable better interpretation and quantification of structural and parameter uncertainties of model estimates. Data are provided in Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata convention compliant (version 1.4) netCDF-4 file formats. There are 3,152 *.nc4 data files with this data set.
* [NACP Regional: National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Aggregated Gridded Model Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gyxx-yj86) - This data set provides two products that were derived from the recently published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis 1-degree terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs (Gridded 1-deg Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et al., 2013). The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional Synthesis - Description of Observations and Models.
* [Improved Lyman-Ultraviolet Astronomy Capabilities through Enhanced Coatings](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ynez-36jj) - <p>The &nbsp;Large Ultraviolet ,Visible, Optical, Infrared (LUVOIR) telescope concept is one of the &nbsp;NASA mission concept studies for&nbsp;the 2020 decadal study that will merge&nbsp;ultraviolet (UV) astrophysics and visible exoplanet science. This proposal aims at developing broadband reflecting mirror coatings with high performance that could&nbsp;be used on the primiary mirror of LUVOIR in order to enable wavelength coverage from the infrared and down to the Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) spectral regions.&nbsp;Improved reflective coatings for optics, particularly in the FUV region (90-120 nm), could yield dramatically more sensitive instruments and permit more instrument design freedom.&nbsp;The coating performance developed through this work will be evaluated both theoretically and experimentally in the context of meeting requirements for exoplanet research.</p><p>Pure Aluminum exhibits a high reflectance over the proposed spectral range of the LUVOIR observatory (90-5000 nm). However, the Al has to be protected from the naturally occurring Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> oxide layer (when exposed to oxygen) with a thin film of a transparent material for use below 130 nm. Aluminum protected with fluorides such as LiF or MgF<sub>2</sub> have been the most commonly used solutions [4]. But below 102 nm down to 90 nm, no transparent material is available to protect Al and coating mirror reflectance stays well below 30%. But even above 102 nm, the reflectance of protected Al is limited by the residual absorption of the fluoride overcoats and the hygroscopic nature of the LiF overcoat.&nbsp; The low reflectivity of coatings in the Lyman Ultraviolet (LUV) range of 90-130 nm is one of the biggest constraints on FUV telescope and spectrograph design, and it limits the science return of FUV-sensitive space missions. In fact, to achieve high-reflectance in broadband coatings has been identified as an &ldquo;Essential Goal&rdquo; in the technology needs for the LUVOIR) surveyor observatory. Improved reflective coatings for optics, particularly in the LUV spectrum, could yield dramatically more sensitive instruments and permit more instrument design freedom. Furthermore, investigations in improving reflectance performance of coatings in this region has the potential to offer unprecedented return on investment given that the LUV contains the highest density of line observations in the UVVIS-IR spectrum.&nbsp;</p>
* [Advanced Manufacturing Technologies for Miniaturized Instruments](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w4nu-n7wz) - <p>We will design and construct miniaturized instruments ideal for CubeSat/SmallSat and other planetary missions that are optimized for throughput while addressing fundamental limitations of miniaturization of instruments that are imposed by precision and fastener issues.&nbsp;</p>
* [Habitat Particle Impact Monitoring System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jze4-mhd4) - <p>The purpose of this project is the development of particle impact detection technology for application to habitable space exploration modules, both in space and on the surfaces of Solar System bodies. This mission-enabling technology will be needed to improve the safety of future human exploration missions. Inflatable space structures have unique characteristics that would benefit from an instrument system for detecting impact penetrations and reporting the extent of these penetrations, as well as their size and location.  Building on previous experience, (i.e. the Habitat Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) hardware and software, which was developed for the Habitat Demonstration Unit) a system particularly adapted to the multilayer inflatable space structures can be developed.   The HIMS sensors represent a class of sensors that are both low mass, simply emplaced, and require little power or system resources.  This sensor system was applied to test sample coupons, representative of inflatable structures, modified as required, and subjected to hypervelocity impacts. Results of these tests allowed system verification for this type of space structure, with the ultimate goal to achieve an automatic impact location and characterization system for the inflatable space structure.<p/><p>The goal of the Habitat particle Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) is to develop a fully automated, end-to-end particle impact detection system for crewed space exploration modules, both in space and on planetary surfaces.  When micrometeoroids or orbital debris impacts occur on a space habitat, crew members need to be quickly informed of the likely extent of damage, and then take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the mission. HIMS uses multiple thin film piezo-polymer vibration sensors to detect impacts on a surface and characterize the impact locations and degree of penetration.  Installation of the HIMS sensors is easy, and does not require any major reconfiguration of the habitat structure. The detection capabilities of HIMS on a hard-shell structure were successfully demonstrated on the Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) Pressurized Excursion Module (PEM) during the 2010-2011 Desert Research and Technology Studies campaign. The main objective for the project in FY12 was to explore the feasibility of using HIMS for particle impact detection on multi-layer inflatable structures and determine optimum sensor configuration requirements for potential applications on future inflatable habitats. Hypervelocity impact tests were performed on a test article consisting of a spherical rubber bladder inflated within a Kevlar envelope "restraint layer". The tests showed that the system detects the impact in both the Kevlar layer and the rubber bladder.  The ring-down acoustic response of the simplified target indicates a signal detection range of at least 3 m from the point of impact.  It is hypothesized that an actual inflatable structure, with higher stiffness and thicker walls, would propagate the acoustical signals with less loss. Thus the system design and sensor configuration for inflatable structures is expected to be similar to designs and configurations already tested on rigid structures.</p>
* [Graphene Field Effect Transistors for Radiation Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fwcs-3623) - <p>This is  propose to develop Graphene Field Effect Transistor based Radiation Sensors (GFET-RS) for NASA Manned Spaceflight Missions anticipated in next several decades.<p/><p>The device consists of a graphene piece deposited on a Si substrate with certain thickness of insulation layer. In our initial experiment, constant radiation was applied above the GFET and device conductance was measured before and after the radiation. We observed an increase of the device mobility (transconductance) after the radiation. This demonstration showed that graphene is radiation hard and its conductance changes with radiation. With the IRAD fund, we will continue exploring sensing mechanisms in GFETs and identify optimal absorber substrates and device geometries to improve radiation detection speed, sensitivity, and energy resolution of our GFET-RS devices.</p>
* [Accelerating Memory-Access-Limited HPC Applications via Novel Fast Data Compression, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gi56-xesv) - A fast-paced continual increase on the ratio of CPU to memory speed feeds an exponentially growing limitation for extracting performance from HPC systems. Breaking this memory wall is one of the most important challenges that the HPC community faces today. In Phase I we introduced aggressive innovations enable the injection of unprecedented acceleration into vast classes of memory-access-bound HPC codes via ultra-fast software-based data compression. Groundbreaking speedup on a fully functional NPBCG prototype was delivered to NASA, thus validating the tremendous potential of our approach. The proposed approach is based on a revolutionary theory of compression spearheaded by Accelogic (Compressive Computing), which is able to provide enormous compressive gains for the typical floating point data of HPC applications. In Phase II we will build on our success with the NPBCG benchmark, and move boldly into tackling the acceleration of a real-life high-profile code, namely NASA's Cart3D, improving its performance by a paradigm-shifting 2x to 4x end-to-end wall-clock time acceleration by the end of Phase II. Our firm has accumulated crucial know-how and has synthesized its expertise into a powerful industrial-quality process for software acceleration that will be used to ensure success on completing Phase II objectives. In Phase II we also plan on injecting a second NASA code with basic Compressive Computing techniques, and providing it with base levels of acceleration of ~1.3-2x. We will choose this second code from a pool of high-profile codes that have already signed up as early adopters for this project: FUN3D, USM3D, Enzo, and WRF. The work on a second NASA code will also serve as the ultimate field test of the broadness and ease-of-infusion of the proposed technology.
We have secured complementary funds in the amount of $500,000 to increase resources and ensure that the proposed Phase II proposed will be successfully accomplished.
* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/45wt-h3qq) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. (2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This data set is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).
* [SAFARI 2000 Daily Rainfall Estimates, 0.1-Deg, Southern Africa, 1993-2001](https://data.nasa.gov/d/46m8-5peb) - The Microwave InfraRed Algorithm (MIRA) is used to produce an imagery data set of daily mean rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution over southern Africa for the period 1993-2001. MIRA combines passive microwave (PMW) from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) on board the DMSP F10 and F14 satellites at a resolution of 0.5 degrees and infrared (IR) data from the Meteosat 4, 5, 6, and 7 satellites in 2-hour slots at a resolution of 5 km. This approach accounts for the limitations of both data types in estimating precipitation. Rainfall estimates are produced at the high spatial and temporal frequency of the IR data using rainfall information from the PMW data. An IR/rain rate relationship, variable in space and time, is derived from coincident observations of IR and PMW rain rate (accumulated over a calibration domain) using the probability matching method. The IR/rain rate relationship is then applied to IR imagery at full temporal resolution. The results presented here are the daily means of those derived rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution.The rainfall data sets are flat binary images with no headers. They are compressed band sequential (bsq) files that contain all of the daily images for the given year. Each image is an array of 401 lines, each with 341 binary floating-point numbers, containing rainfall at 0.1 degree resolution for the area 10 to 50 degrees longitude and 0 to -34 degrees latitude. The number of band sequential images in each annual file and the associated dates can be found in the file MIRA_data_dates.csv.

Ground measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) were made using the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer and Sunfleck PAR ceptometer, respectively, during focused periods from August 20 to August 28, 2000 at a dry grassland site adjacent to the Sua Pan. The 1 km by 1 km sampling grid was a homogeneous, relatively dense grassland, with a height of 20-100 cm and two prevalent grass types, Odyssea paucinervis and Sporobolus spicatus. Associated reflectance measurements were made with the PARABOLA and ASD instruments (Helmlinger et al., 2004a; 2004b).The data files contain measurements of LAI and PAR reflectance and transmission and a description of sky conditions during the sampling periods. With one exception, all measurements were made under clear sky conditions. PAR data were measured only on the transect scale while LAI are provided at both pixel and transect scales. PAR readings were performed at 93 transect sample points, and LAI readings were performed at 135 (93 transect and 42 subgrid) sample points. Each file also contains mean LAI and PAR values. The data files are ASCII tables, in comma-separated-value format.

* [Model Based Aircraft Upset Detection and Recovery System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xagj-v2zf) - This proposal describes a system for detecting upset conditions and providing the corresponding control recovery actions to maintain flight integrity for general application to aircraft. To maintain and improve aircraft safety as air capacity grows as part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS), it is necessary to address the primary causes leading to in-flight loss of control accidents, including aircraft upsets, degraded flight operations, and environmental disturbance effects. A model-based upset detection and recovery control architecture is proposed that combines fault detection algorithms to identify the onset of an upset condition with optimal and near-optimal control responses. On-line parameter identification algorithms are used to adapt the core detection and recovery algorithms for degraded flight operations and/or modeling uncertainties. Distributed MEMS-based sensing and SMA-driven control effectors are used to augment the installed aircraft state measurements and control capability for rapid detection of and recovery from upset conditions. During Phase I, preliminary system design and application to a small unmanned aircraft will be performed, including flight test demonstration of the upset detection and control algorithms and hardware. This work will form the foundation for subsequent development of a family of aircraft upset mitigation systems for both manned and unmanned aircraft.
* [Hydrogen Sulfide Micro-Sensor for Biomass Fouling Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/itqi-yn7s) - Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S)is the leading chemical agent causing human fatalities following inhalation exposures. The overall aim of this project is to develop and produce an inexpensive, highly selective and sensitive solid-state chemical micro-sensor with low power consumption that is suitable for rapid detection of very low-level (ppb) concentration of H2S in ambient air.
The technology principle used to develop the micro-sensor is based on the knowledge that H2S is adsorbed into gold at an operating temperature range. By using a gold thin-film, and MEMS technology, we will produce a micro-sensor with the following specifications 1 mm x 1 mm micro-sensor, 3 seconds response and recovery time, 10 mW power consumption, and detection in the ppb range.
Phase I will investigate the feasibility of the design, fabrication, testing, and validation of the micro-sensor in collaboration with researchers from the Integrated Nanosystems Research Facility at the University of California Irvine.
During Phase II, the innovative solid-state micro-sensor will be integrated in a miniaturized battery powered wireless instrument for applications in biomass fouling detection.
* [Precollimator Manufacturing for X-ray Telescopes, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rshe-fnu4) - Space-based x-ray telescopes currently involve the use of a precollimator (PC) to shield the optics from stray light. Each PC consists of cylindrical aluminum ribs (blades) with varying radii, alignment frames to guide the blade positions and the blade housing body. The alignment frame and the housing are made of Aluminum 6061 and 7075 alloy, respectively. A heat-forming process with thin aluminum sheets is used to produce the ribs that run between the alignment frame. We are proposing a new method to build a PC out with emerging technologies, using Additive Manufacturing (AM) to build a blank that is the rough shape of the PC but with thickened ribs and then using wire Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) to cut the final shape. This will result in an easier to produce PC, with more rigidity due to its integral structure and potentially thinner and better positioned blades. It will also be made of Titanium instead of Aluminum and have a less shiny surface finish, both of which are more favorable characteristics in stray light blocking.
We plan to design a Test Article that mimics the size and location configuration of the current PC technology. We plan to investigate the competing AM processes of Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) and Electron Beam Welding (EBM) to determine which one is a better process for the blank fabrication and if there are any potential limitations to either technology. Then we will use a cutting-edge technology wire EDM machine to cut the final shape in the blank and determine what limitations exist in positioning accuracy and thickness of the blades. We anticipate both to be better than the current PC technology.
* [Accelerating Memory-Access-Limited HPC Applications via Novel Fast Data Compression, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3dnc-dufy) - A fast-paced continual increase on the ratio of CPU to memory speed feeds an exponentially growing limitation for extracting performance from HPC systems. Ongoing developments and trends make it clear that this ratio will keep increasing over the next decade. Breaking this memory wall is one of the most important challenges that the HPC community faces today. In this project we introduce novel and highly effective ways of attacking the memory wall through the use of "compressive computing," a theory that we have invented, developed, and successfully put into practice in other areas of HPC with paradigm-shifting results. Once integrated into memory-bound HPC applications, the proposed technology will support significant acceleration factors (typically beyond 2x) without compromising the numerical accuracy of the application code. In Phase I we will develop the fundamentals of the theory of compressive computing for memory access acceleration, deploy a set of functional components, and produce a fully functional prototype that demonstrates convincingly that the technology works for acceleration of memory-bound applications. The prototype will be integrated in at least one NAS Parallel Benchmark. In Phase II we will focus our work on maturing and refining the technology, and will be driven by a concrete target of accelerating at least two memory-access-bound NASA applications. Five of the top eight most-used application codes in NASA supercomputers have already signed-in as early integrators of the technology. We have secured complementary funds in the amount of $150,000 that we will be able to use to increase resources and ensure that all Phase I proposed work will be successfully accomplished in a timely manner, and a total of $500,000 to ensure a successful and early penetration of the proposed technology into the market.
* [Aircraft Flight Envelope Identification through On-Board Model Based Estimation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6pd2-jz9h) - To improve aviation safety with anticipated growth in capacity, it is necessary to develop flight control technologies that enable safe operations as anomalous conditions occur. These developments are particularly important to reduce fatal loss of control accidents due to aircraft degradation and abrupt aerodynamic changes including upsets. It is necessary to develop methods to identify and characterize anomalies in flight, as well as to estimate the impacts on the flight envelope and the ability to effect control forces for recovery and/or flight planning to achieve safe landing. An approach to identify anomalies including aerodynamic upsets based on model-based fault detection methods will be combined with physics-based models to assess the impact on the aircraft flight envelope and controllability. These tools will permit off-line analysis and will facilitate the development of on-board guidance and control algorithms to support NASA goals for greater aircraft resiliency during adverse flight conditions. In Phase I, development and demonstration of a generalized system architecture to identify and assess the effects of aircraft anomalies will be performed, which builds upon previous work toward model-based aircraft upset detection. Phase I demonstrations will include simulation evaluation for a generic transport aircraft and test demonstration for a small unmanned aircraft.

* [SMEX03 ENVISAT ASAR Data, Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kssq-yf9f) - This data set is comprised of browse images acquired over the regional study areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma USA as part of the 2003 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX03). The experiment was conducted from March through July 2003 via the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument on board the European Space Agency's (ESA) Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT). Cross-polarized C-band ASAR images were acquired in order to obtain a backscatter coefficient measurement over a range of natural vegetation types. However, the images provided here are only browse images and therefore cannot be used to derive backscatter coefficient values. Researchers interested in backscatter coefficient values must obtain the ASAR data. The total volume for this combined data set is approximately 65 megabytes. Data are available via FTP and are provided as JPEG image files and JGW georeference files. Also included and available via FTP are the following types of header files: HAN files, ASCII text files, and INI files. These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E).

* [The First JFET-based Silicon Carbide Active Pixel Sensor UV Imager, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9vsm-hy7a) - Solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) imaging is critically important in the fields of space astronomy, national defense, and bio-chemistry. United Silicon Carbide, Inc. proposes to develop and commercialize a unique JFET-based monolithically-integrated radiation-tolerant solar blind active pixel sensor (APS) UV imager. Silicon carbide is the ideal materials system due to its negligible dark currents, excellent radiation tolerance, intrinsic insensitivity to visible and near IR light, and technological maturity. The Silicon carbide JFET is an ideal choice as an IC building block, as it is immune to the presence of stacking faults in wafer material and is free from possible threshold voltage drifting associated with the SiC MOSFET.
The proposed PiN and LJFET based APS circuitry has the potential for reliable operation at temperatures exceeding 150 C. The proposed design of the active pixel sensor can be adopted for detection of more energetic particles, such as EUV and soft-X-ray, by increasing the thickness of the active low doped layer. Such APS detector arrays could be custom designed, including pixel size and epilayer thickness, and would be of nearly UNIVERSAL USE in nuclear particle detection and spectroscopy. While the active pixel sensor market is niche, applications in related Silicon Carbide LJFET based analog processes offering temperature operation above 200 C have tremendous value in the commercial, industrial & high temperature market space. LJFET IC building blocks such as voltage references, oscillators, comparators and regulators form the cell circuits for such products as PWM controllers, power transistor gate drivers, voltage regulators and amplifiers.
* [A Three-Dimensional Nanoporous Silicon Anode for High-Energy Density Lithium-ion Batteries, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fdyg-ufmq) - This SBIR phase I program is directed toward the development of novel, nanoporous silica anodes for low-earth-orbiting (LEO) spacecraft power applications. Silica has attracted a lot of attention as a next-generation anode material because of its very high theoretical capacity compared to state-of-the-art graphitic carbon anodes. However, its use in Li-ion battery applications is limited by its poor cycle stability caused by large volume changes experienced during Li insertion and extraction. The unique pore structure of materials developed in this program will overcome this limitation and realize rechargeable Li-ion cells with high-specific energy and extremely stable cycle life for LEO spacecraft power applications.
* [Prognostic Fault Detection and Isolation for EMA and EPS Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jqrs-9rqh) - In response to NASA SBIR topic X1.04, Ridgetop Group will extend and adapt RingDown: an innovative system for the non-invasive prognostic monitoring of the health of electromechanical actuators and related power systems. This comprehensive solution provides both advanced hardware sensors to monitor the systems and prognostic health management algorithms to interpret the signals available in them. RingDown will significantly improve the reliability of and confidence in these critical NASA systems by alerting NASA personnel to impending failures well before they occur, averting disaster and improving confidence in the health of the systems.
Electromechanical actuators (EMAs) are comprised of a complex system-of-systems: a high-power switch mode power supply to power the EMA's servo drive, a lower-voltage switch mode power supply to power the EMA's logic controller, power inverters, and the EMA itself. The sensors and algorithms provided by Ridgetop will allow NASA to monitor the health of-and anticipate failures in-all of these systems. In addition, these algorithms will be applicable to other switch mode power supplies (SMPSs), which are a very common component in NASA's electrical systems.
Ridgetop's goal in this SBIR program is to transition these EMA prognostic health management technologies into fielded systems. In Phase I, Ridgetop will extend the RingDown sensors developed under previous NASA SBIRs to monitor additional components in the EMA system-of-systems. Ridgetop will also prototype the algorithms to interpret the data from those sensors in this Phase. In Phase II, Ridgetop will implement additional functionality for these algorithms and then field-test the combined algorithm and sensor solution. In a future Phase III or other commercialization program, a final version of this comprehensive solution will be demonstrated in-flight and then transitioned into actual system usage.
* [Novel, Regenerable Microlith Catalytic Reactor for CO2 Reduction via Bosch Process, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9r98-4rdk) - Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) proposes to develop an extremely compact, lightweight and regenerable Microlith<SUP>REG</SUP> catalytic CO2 reduction reactor, capable of converting mixtures of CO2 and H2 to carbon and water vapor with high CO2 conversions at high throughputs and at low operating temperatures. This is based on a novel catalytic reactor approach with high heat and mass transfer, high conversion efficiency, narrow temperature distribution, and novel approaches to carbon removal. The utilization of carbon dioxide to produce life support consumables, such as O2 and H2O, via Bosch reaction offers a potential advance for NASA's cabin atmosphere revitalization system (ARS) and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) concepts for long-term manned space missions. Current Bosch reactor designs suffer from a large recycle penalty due to slow reaction rates and the inherent limitation in approaching thermodynamic equilibrium, plus significant challenge in carbon removal. PCI's short contact time catalysts offer the potential for faster reaction rates, higher conversions and a reduced need for recycle. In addition, strategies will be explored for more effective mechanical and chemical approaches to carbon removal and catalyst regeneration. The approach offers a potential for an ultra-compact Bosch reactor with improved effectiveness and robustness, with lower pressure drop and power requirement.
* [Lidar Orbital Angular Momentum Sensor](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qbdv-6rh2) - The recognition in recent decades that electromagnetic fields have angular momentum (AM) in the form of not only polarization (or spin AM) but also orbital (OAM) has resulted in an explosion of theoretical and experimental studies to understand the possible implications of these fields and their applications. The first applications have been achieved in astronomy (exoplanet vortex coronagraph), particle manipulation (optical tweezers), and encoding information on lasers (optical communication). OAM is a previously unrecognized degree of freedom for light that can be readily controlled, manipulated, and detected in laser beams characterized by helical wavefronts that rotate forward like a screw (vortex beams). The objective of the proposed effort is to utilize vortex beams to significantly increase the information that can be obtained from backscatter lidars. A lidar receiver will be developed that incorporates an optical angular momentum mode sorter. This will provide improved daytime performance by the spatial coherency filtering of background light and allow single scattering to be uniquely distinguished from multiple scattering in turbid environments (dense clouds, coastal waters). The latter is analogous to the exoplanet coronagraph: the lidar beam will be detected to greater optical depth into turbid media because the bright haze of multiple scattering will be eliminated. The effort will go on to demonstrate how examples of vortex beams can be created that will interact with the atmosphere in different ways, improving overall lidar performance. This three year effort will bring the measurement concept and receiver technology from a TRL 2 to 4.
* [Airborne Multi-Gas Sensor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/giud-whxf) - Mesa Photonics proposes to develop an Airborne Multi-Gas Sensor (AMUGS) based upon two-tone, frequency modulation spectroscopy (TT-FMS). Mesa Photonics has developed a fiber-coupled implementation of TT-FMS that leverages telecommunications lasers as sources and WiFi electronics for signal processing. With this approach, sensitive trace gas detection in a robust, compact and low-power package has been achieved. In work to-date, we have demonstrated the capability of this TT-FMS concept in a single channel. In the proposed project, we aim to demonstrate multiplexing of TT-FMS to provide simultaneous, real-time measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). In addition to demonstrating the extensibility of TT-FMS, the Phase I project would address key performance limitations encountered in early feasibility work. The objectives of Phase I are to: - Implement and test polarization management during phase modulation to reduce baseline variation induced by observed in previous work, - Build a two-channel TT-FMS with breadboard components, - Establish baseline (single-channel) performance of TT-FMS when polarization maintaining phase modulation is included, - Calibrate and evaluate the full AMGUS (two-channel, TT-FMS) apparatus. Accomplishment of Phase I objectives would yield a benchtop technology ready for transition to a UAV-compatible AMUGS prototype in Phase II.
* [Global Cyclone Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xr52-id7s) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI) Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation (WASP). Utilizing average monthly precipitation data from 1980 through 2000 at a resolution of 2.5 degrees, WASP assesses the precipitation deficit or surplus over a three month temporal window that is weighted by the magnitude of the seasonal cyclic variation in precipitation. The three months' averages are derived from the precipitation data and the median rainfall for the 21 year period is calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells where the three month running average of precipitation is less than 1 mm per day ae excluded. Drought events are identified when the magnitude of a monthly precipitation deficit is less than or equal to 50 percent of its longterm median value for three or more consecutive months. Grid cells are then divided into 10 classes having an approximately equal number of grid cells. Higher grid cell values denote higher frequencies of drought occurrences. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).

* [Simulating CubeSat Structure Deployment Dynamics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/r27a-ag8u) - There is high value in simulating the nonlinear dynamics of stowing, deploying, and performance of deployable space structures, especially given the profound limitations of physical testing. Dynamic simulation can reduce the risk of developing new deployable space structures, including solar arrays, by predicting transient motions and loads during stowage, deployment, and mission-related maneuvers. Dynamic simulation can also be used to assess the efficacy of using motion control to mitigate the effect of accelerations on the response of the space structure. The proposed innovations of this proposal are: 1) Development of a general automated process to efficiently take a detailed hinge assembly model and simulate its range of motion while retrieving stiffness information for all degrees of freedom and convert that data to define a simple but accurate nonlinear point-to-point force for use in the solar array assembly model, 2) Development and simulation of a high-fidelity system-level model of the deployment dynamics of an commercial deployable solar array that was designed for use with a 6U cubesat, and 3) Review and evaluation of the hinge assembly simplification process and the modeling approach by an independent resource. The significance of the proposed innovation is: 1) This work builds upon previous simulation success with a split-tube solar array by adding a new automated method to efficiently develop an accurate but simplified representation of the connections used on rigid panel solar arrays, 2) This is an initial engagement with the products of the smallsat community and a commercial cubesat solar array will be simulated. The successful results may encourage the smallsat community to use this technology, thereby reducing technical risk, 3) The simulation of a commercial cubesat solar array in this project potentially leads to obtaining validation comparisons between the simulation and physical test results during a corresponding Phase II effort.
* [In-situ Airborne Sampler for Advanced Guided Dropsonde, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sxzk-bbn6) - The proposed innovation is a low-cost, retrievable and reusable, autonomously guided dropsonde capable of in-situ atmospheric measurements. The proposed effort will focus on the engineering work involved with the retrieval of volcanic ash plume samples. This work will build upon a previous NASA SBIR Phase I project Latitude Engineering completed in 2011: the development of an Advanced Guided Dropsonde (AGD). Though the tested prototype received favorable reviews, funding restructuring of the SBIR program within NASA prevented funding for Phase II. To keep the momentum behind this innovative airborne platform, Latitude Engineering is proposing to build upon this accomplishment: refine the current dropsonde design and develop a sampling system for atmospheric particulates that will be integrated into this 4 cm diameter research vessel. Miniaturized particulate sampling equipment for airborne missions is not commercially available. Even for full scale systems, many research programs develop their own collection and sensor systems. With the small size limitations of the AGD, a multi-stage particulate sampler can be developed that can collect size segregated particulate including aerosols. With the significant need for atmospheric particulate sampling, the AGD can offer unprecedented access to atmospheric samples including those at high altitudes.
The key goals of this Phase I proposal are to demonstrate the capability of the AGD to be released from a host manned aircraft, collect an atmospheric particulate sample from a pre-programmed altitude and location, and deliver the protected sample to a pre-programmed recovery area. This system, engineered to be cost compatible with existing dropsonde launch systems, is recoverable and re-useable.
* [Global Annual Average PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y3ja-bq7v) - Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data sets represent a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data. Together the grids provide a continuous surface of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. The satellite AOD retrievals were converted to ground-level concentrations based on a conversion factor developed by researchers at Dalhousie University that accounts for spatial and temporal variations in aerosol properties and vertical structure as derived from a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 30 arc-minutes (0.5 degree or approximately 50 sq. km at the equator) and cover the world from 70°N to 60°S latitude. The grids were produced by researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute in collaboration with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network/Columbia University under a NASA-ROSES project entitled "Using Satellite Data to Develop Environmental Indicators: An Application of NASA Data Products to Support High Level Decisions for National and International Environmental Protection". Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature death as well as increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease, especially in the elderly, young children, and those already suffering from these illnesses. The World Health Organization guideline for PM2.5 average annual exposure is less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms per cubic meter, whereas the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) primary standard is less than or equal to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA primary standards are designed to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.

* [A Pulsed Nonlinear Raman Detection of Trace Organics with SERS Enhanced Sensitivity, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yn4z-jwve) - A significant technology gap for NASA astrobiology missions is the field detection of organics at the sub ppm level. Currently, NASA uses different sensing technologies such as Pyrolysis&#150;GCMS to analyze planetary samples. These instruments require complex sample handling and can process only a limited number of samples. It is critical to develop an effective instrument with extended and enhanced capabilities to enable future planetary multiple-mission needs. We propose to develop a novel nonlinear Raman spectral sensing instrument for trace organic detection at the sub ppm level based on fluoresence-free surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The proposed instrument will be capable of detecting the molecular signatures in Martian samples in the field with significantly improved sensitivity (>100,000,000) and reduced noise (>100). It will offer NASA a ultra sensitive deployable instrument suitable for robotic missions in terms of in situ measurements, resolution, bandwidth, compact size, low cost, and ruggedness. The detection of organics at the sub ppm level in Martian-like soils will be applicable to several future NASA missions, in particular future rovers for the upcoming Mars 2020 mission. These mobile, fast and agile rovers are focused on collection for sample return and require non-sampling analytical instruments.

* [Evacuated Airship for Mars Missions](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n6f9-wbqa) - We propose to overcome some of the limitations of current technologies for Mars exploration and even extend current operational capabilities by introducing the concept of a vacuum airship. This concept is similar to a standard balloon, whereas a balloon uses helium or hydrogen to displace air and provide lift, a vacuum airship uses a rigid structure to maintain a vacuum to displace air and provide lift. A vacuum airship made of a homogenous material cannot withstand the atmospheric pressure on Earth for any material humans have yet discovered, which can be proven using the critical buckling load of a sphere. However, from an initial analysis of the vacuum airship structure and relationship to atmospheric conditions, Mars appears to have an atmosphere in which the operation of a vacuum airship would not only be possible, but beneficial over a conventional balloon or dirigible. In addition, a multi-layer approach, in conjunction with a lattice, would circumvent the buckling problems of a single homogenous shell. The lattice used to support the two layers of the vacuum airship shell can be made, using modulation of the lengths of the members, to fit the curvature of the vacuum airship precisely by following an atlas approach to the modulation. The Martian atmosphere has a pressure to density ratio that is very beneficial to the operation of a vacuum airship; this is a result of the high average molecular weight of the atmosphere (relative to other planets in the solar system) and the temperature of the atmosphere, the trend for which can be observed from the ideal gas law. Through a more in-depth analysis of the vacuum airship model, it can be shown that the vacuum airship may theoretically carry more than twice as much payload as a modeled dirigible of the same size, a 40-meter radius, in the Martian atmosphere. A vacuum airship would be a valuable design for a vehicular probe for Mars. There are far fewer obstacles for an aerial vehicle as compared to a land vehicle such as existing Mars rovers, e.g. one need not worry about the vacuum airship getting stuck in a trench or being unable to traverse terrain. The vacuum airship could be used as a communication relay for other vehicular probes on Mars thereby overcoming line of sight constraints. If the vacuum airship is damaged, it can land, be repaired, and re-evacuated to resume operation, whereas a balloon would need to have gas pumped back into the vessel. Since the vacuum airship does not use a lifting gas, it can perform a near infinite number of compensation maneuvers to adjust or stabilize its altitude in a temperature variant environment. The vacuum airship could use its structure to protect the instruments from solar radiation and high energy particles. The vacuum airship probe would be able to traverse a much greater area of the planet in a smaller amount of time because there is no need to worry about getting stuck, and the vacuum airship can also observe a greater swath of land by rising in elevation. Even though the vacuum airship would be aerially base, the vehicle would still be able to touch down and perform tasks on the ground; it is even possible the vacuum airship could be used to transport ground probes to different locations. As far as energy is concerned, the large surface area of the vacuum airship would provide plenty of area for solar cells which would allow the vehicle to gather a large amount of solar energy without any additional structure, and once the airship is evacuated, the only energy it requires is for propulsion which can be accomplished by electric motors, unlike helicopters and airplanes which require energy to be devoted to lift.
* [Open|SpeedShop Ease of Use Performance Analysis for Heterogenious Processor Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y39y-bzeg) - We propose building upon the modular extensible architecture and existing capabilities of Open|SpeedShop to provide seamless, integrated, heterogeneous processor performance analysis. The NVIDIA GPU and Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) processors are increasingly important at high performance computing (HPC) laboratories within NASA for use on NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects because of their ability to accelerate scientific application performance. In order to understand what impact these accelerators are having on performance, tools must succinctly present heterogeneous processor performance information. One of the key goals of this work is to develop innovative methods for presenting the performance information extracted from applications running on both traditional CPU and GPU/MIC processors. And, specifically, to provide command line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI) displays of the heterogeneous processor performance information that facilitates the user's understanding of how their application utilizes the accelerator. For this project, Phase I GPU-related research will include measuring the usefulness of a GPU kernel, including device utilization, data transfer rates, device efficiency metric, internal device tiling factors, device memory hierarchy usage, as well as additional factors outlined in the referenced material. When measuring the performance of an application that contains concurrent processing on both the CPU and GPU processors, attributing time spent to the proper processor can be difficult - a difficulty exacerbated by the potential presence and usage of multiple accelerators concurrently. Accurately measuring the interactions of multiple accelerator devices is necessary in order to accurately report the application's performance to the user, but is difficult with the current set of accelerator interfaces. Developing techniques for mitigating these limitations will be another area of our GPU research.

* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI Biophysical Parameter Fields, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/62gr-szyg) - ABSTRACT: The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data set and derived biophysical parameter fields were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. This multiple resolution (1/4, 1/2 and 1 degree in latitude and longitude) biophysical parameter data set contains essential variables for the calculation of photosynthesis, and the energy and water exchange between the Earth's surface (in particular of vegetation) and the lower boundary layer of the atmosphere. The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) is related to the light absorption and the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation. It also serves as an intermediate variable to calculate vegetation cover fraction (Vcover), total Leaf Area Index (LAI_T), green leaf area index (LAI_G), roughness length (z0), zero plane displacement (d), and snow-free albedo. The biophysical parameters were derived assuming one canopy layer. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.

Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure. GNSS observations from a global network can be utilized for atmospheric measurements. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce independently computed VTEC maps. The IGS Ionosphere Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS VTEC maps. The rapid VTEC maps are computed with a resolution of 2 hours in UT, 5 degrees in longitude and 2.5 degrees in latitude; they have an availability with a latency of 1-2 days.
* [Ocean Life Detection on Alien Worlds, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bx98-hakc) - This proposal is in response to NASA's request for technologies that can enhance the detection of life in alien oceans. As stated in the call, the Technologies for Detection of Extant Life subtopic seeks instruments and component technologies that will enable unambiguous determination of whether extant life is present in target environments on other solar system bodies. Because there is no single measurable signature of life, this will require advances in a variety of areas, from those involving sample processing to the detailed components of chemical and optical instruments. Searches for extant life can take place in a variety of environments, including ocean depths, ice sheets, dry deserts, seasonal flows, or even dense atmospheres; technologies are required for handling samples obtained from any or all of these environments. Preprocessing technologies required for those samples may include separation, concentration, dilution, drying, staining, mixing, and many other common processes for laboratory analysis, but which must be done in a remote, autonomous environment. Tests of whether a given sample contains or indicates the presence of extant life include the full range of microbiological and chemical techniques, but those that do not require the addition of potential biomarkers (e.g., complex organics) as part of the test are preferred. We have spent he past 5 years developing a novel means of capturing and concentrating organic molecules onto specialized graphene surfaces, available for later detailed analysis. The adaptation of this technology could offer a new avenue for the detection of key organic elements in ocean environments that contain many background elemental noise sources.
* [Fusion of THEMIS and TES for Accurate Mars Surface Characterization, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s6is-zhbe) - In a recent NASA ROSES solicitation, NASA has expressed strong interest in improving surface characterization of Mars using orbital imagers. Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) and Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) are orbital multispectral imagers of Mars. THEMIS has 10 spectral bands in the 6-13 micrometers region and a spatial resolution of 100 m. TES has 143 spectral bands in the 5-50 micrometers range, but with low spatial resolution of 3x3 km. Although both have been used to map out the surface composition of Mars, there are some limitations. First, THEMIS has low spectral resolution that may not provide accurate surface characterization. Second, TES has low spatial resolution that cannot provide fine spatial details of surface characteristics. Roughly speaking, each TES pixel contains about 900 THEMIS pixels. It is therefore very challenging to fuse the two data sets. We propose a novel and accurate framework that can deal with the above challenge. The framework is based on the latest development in image registration, image fusion, anomaly detection, pixel classification using hyperspectral images, and concentration estimation. First, a two-step image registration algorithm is proposed to align the THEMIS and TES bands. Subpixel accuracy can be achieved. Second, a novel image fusion algorithm is proposed to fuse THEMIS and TES bands to generate an image cube with 143 bands of 100-m resolution images. Our algorithm has been proven to be better than state-of-the-art fusion algorithms. Third, we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm for detecting interesting regions in the fused image cube. This algorithm is known as cluster kernel Reed Xiaoli (CKRX) and has high performance in anomaly detection. Fourth, a sparsity based approach is proposed to perform accurate rock classification. Finally, a deep learning based algorithm is proposed to estimate the chemical composition of the rocks for better surface characterization.
* [Goddard radio-frequency explorer Radio frequency Interference real time Display system](https://data.nasa.gov/d/be4k-nvse) - <p>RFI is an increasingly important factor in the quality performance of radiometer instruments while the quantity of usable microwave measurements is decreasing due to the presence of RFI. Because of the widespread use of wireless communications such as cellphone and satellite TV, the frequencies reserved for the science community are seeing more and more contamination.&nbsp;In particular, no scientific data can be retrieved for the heavily RFI contaminated region. This problem led to the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission implementation of an RFI detection capability on its radiometer digital backend. However, this instrument is limited by the sampling speed and processing resources available. In particular, the digital backend frequency bandwidth is limited to 24MHz. This shows that the spaceflight technology for RFI detection is limited any the higher frequencies for K, Ka band or beyond.</p><p><strong>This effort proposes a game-changing, higher frequency RFI detection and mitigation digital backend for microwave radiometers.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Prototyping a high frequency RFI detection instrument </strong>by combining the GREX system with a new RFI detection algorithm based on information theory and complex-valued signal processing.</p>
* [Microgravity Multi-Phase Flow Experiment for Suborbital Testing (MFEST)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s55r-7nx3) - <p>The primary objective is to conduct a pathfinder, suborbital flight experiment for two-phase fluid flow and separator operations.The primary purpose of this test program is to verify functional operations of a multi-phase flow system and unique separator for a relatively long duration suborbital flight, in support of future space vehicle designs and missions. Two-phase flow experimental studies at reduced gravities have been very limited, and primarily conducted using special aircraft modified to fly parabolas. This first suborbital flight would allow longer-duration, continuous operational testing with variable gravity over a wider range, for both the unique separator and two-phase flow design.    <p/><p>The NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), Crew and Thermal Systems Division (CTSD), had previously developed an orbital flight experiment to 1) test the feasibility of a water purifier for use in zero-gravity conditions, and 2) demonstrate sustained operation of a two-phase flow system with a passive gas/liquid separator. By design, the influent fluid was kept under pressure to saturate the water with gas; however, farther downstream, the fluid mixture is returned to near atmospheric pressure and fed into a vortex separator. The separator and overall system function was designed for operation in both Earth-gravity and zero-gravity conditions. The gas within the system is vented off downstream of the separator, and most of the liquid is re-circulated in the processing loop over the duration of operations. MFEST proposes to modify the experiment to test the two-phase flow and separation functions without using simulated or active water processing. This creates the following benefits/features: this project  will test a two-phase flow system and vortex separator concept that continues to be considered for space applications, under the challenging environment conditions of launch, zero-g, and entry, and with sustained operations;  two-phase flow and separator systems are needed in numerous technical areas (e.g., life support, thermal, science) and have been identified as a critical technology; no long-duration testing for variable gravity has been accomplished for this separator concept/design, and it leverages outdated experiment/hardware (has been on the shelf for a decade) for future spaceflight missions. Multi-phase flow systems can be applicable to technologies designated in multiple draft Office of Chief Technologist (OCT) Space Technology Roadmaps: Technical Area TA02, In-Space Propulsion Technologies; TA03, Space Power and Energy Storage; TA06, Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems; TA07, Human Exploration Destination Systems; and TA14, Thermal Management Systems. The experiment was originally designed for the Space Shuttle mid-deck, but was never flown due to mass, crew time, and other mission limitations. For the suborbital flight opportunity, the primary purpose of the test program would be to verify functional operations of the flow system and unique separator for a relatively long duration with variable gravity, in support of future space vehicle designs and missions.</p>
* [Effect of microgravity on brain gene expression in mice](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7bwh-kbdt) - Changes in gravitational force such as that experienced by astronauts during space flight induce a redistribution of fluids from the caudad to the cephalad portion of the body together with an elimination of normal head-to-foot hydrostatic pressure gradients. To assess brain gene profile changes associated with microgravity and fluid shift a large-scale analysis of mRNA expression levels was performed in the brains of 2 weeks control and hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice using cDNA microarrays. Although to different extent all functional categories displayed significantly regulated genes indicating that considerable transcriptomic alterations are induced by HU. Interestingly the TIC class (transport of small molecules and ions into the cells) had the highest percentage of up-regulated genes while the most down-regulated genes were those of the JAE class (Cell junction Adhesion Extracellular Matrix). TIC genes comprised 16% of those whose expression was altered including sodium channel nonvoltage-gated 1 beta (Scnn1b) glutamate receptor (Grin1) voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (Vdac1) calcium channel beta 3 subunit (Cacnb3) and others. The analysis performed by GeneMAPP revealed several altered protein classes and functional pathways such as blood coagulation and immune response learning and memory ion channels and cell junction. In particular data indicate that HU causes an alteration in hemostasis which resolves in a shift toward a more hyper-coagulative state with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Furthermore HU treatment seems to impact on key steps of synaptic plasticity and learning processes. We used brains of four control (C1 C2 C3 C4) and four tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (E1 E2 E3 E4) mice to ensure statistical relevance of the study. 60 ug of total RNA extracted in TRIzol from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences NJ). Differently labeled cDNAs obtained from a pair of biological replicas were co-hybridized overnight at 50C with a microscope slide spotted with ~ 27,000 mouse cDNA sequences produced by the Microarray Core Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the xef xbf xbdmultiple yellow xef xbf xbd design (i.e.: C1C2 C3C4 E1E2 E3E4) described in Iacobas DA Fan C Iacobas S et al. Transcriptomic changes in developing kidney exposed to chronic hypoxia. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 349(1):329-38).
* [Wearable, Sustained Acoustic Medicine for Back Pain](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8w3r-md8a) - 1. Original project aims/objectives: Back pain due to disk-herniation and space-adaptation is a serious concern for the health and wellbeing for astronauts. Current therapeutic drugs and devices to treat space travel related back pain are either systemically and/or cognitively dangerous for mission critical activities, ineffective, and/or non-renewable. The aims of this project were to evaluate long-duration ultrasound therapy as a therapeutic option to non-invasively and non-pharmaceutically effectively treat chronic low-back pain by reducing inflammation, muscle tightness, and modulating neuronal activation at the site of pain. Specifically, the project studied the use of a Food & Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared multi-hour prescription use sustained acoustic medicine device (sam Professional) as a solar-rechargeable therapeutic device to reduce pain, improve range of motion, and increase quality of life for patients with chronic low back pain. Additionally, the project included technology development of other ultrasonic frequencies and device form-factor that could prove useful in the space environment. 2. Key findings: The sam Professional medical device was determined to reduce pain by approximately 2 points on the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale for patients with moderate to severe low back pain. In 65-subjects meeting study inclusion criteria, back pain was reduced by approximately 30% from baseline when the device was applied 5 times per week over 8 weeks of treatment. Patients in the study reported improved range of motion with less pain, and improved quality of life during daily activities. Analysis of the human subjects' data demonstrated statistically significant (p<0.01) pain reduction for chronic back pain. The multi-hour ultrasound technology was further developed into a coin-sized form factor capable of multi-hour ultrasound delivery, and electronics/transducers were designed and tested for 1 MHz ultrasonic capability. Both clinical and technological project aims and objectives where successfully accomplished. 3. Impact of key findings on hypotheses, technology requirements, objectives and specific aims of the original proposal: The project found that multi-hour daily ultrasound therapy significantly reduced chronic back pain. This clinical study on 55-subjects provides additional clinical efficacy data on managing the symptoms of lower back pain with sam. When combined with other studies on the sam Professional device for back pain (approximately 120 patients in total) the therapeutic intervention is an available non-surgical/non-drug option for back pain patients. The technology is currently available on the US market for prescription use only. Additional electronic testing and validation of the devices would need to be conducted for space deployment. 4. Proposed research plan for the coming year: The project was successfully completed and no additional work is scheduled. The project team anticipates preparation of the key findings for clinical dissemination of the outcome data.
* [Fuzzy Spatiotemporal Data Mining to Activity Recognition in Smart Homes](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3ydc-zjjc) - A primary goal to design smart homes is to provide automatic assistance for the residents to make them able to live independently at home. Activity recognition is done to achieve the mentioned goal and then to provide assistance, we would need three sort of information. First, we would need to know the goal of the resident, then the pattern that the resident should obey to achieve its goal and third sort of needed information is the deviations from the previously known patterns. In the presented paper, spatiotemporal aspects of daily activities are surveyed to mine the patterns of activities realized by the smart homes residents. Necessary data to model the spatiotemporal aspects of daily activities is provided by embedded sensors in the smart home. We believe that to accomplish daily activities, specific objects are applied and by analyzing the movement of objects and resident(s), we would obtain valuable information to model the daily activities of the Smart Home’s residents.
* [Fused Reality for Enhanced Training and Flight Research](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q837-pb54) - <p>An updated, advanced head-mounted display is providing test pilots with unprecedented analysis and evaluation capabilities for aircraft and pilot performance, tasks that until now have been largely evaluated subjectively. The Fused Reality system combines real-world images from a video camera with computer-generated virtual images to create a highly immersive environment for complex tasks, such as landing, formation flying, and aerial refueling. Originally developed under a NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract and flight-tested on a Calspan Learjet, this tool has been significantly improved, new tasks and capabilities have been added,&nbsp;and is now a portable, standalone system that can be easily &nbsp;integrated on a wide range of flight test aircraft.</p><p><strong>Work to date</strong>: This project enabled Armstrong researchers to add&nbsp;functionality to the system first developed under an SBIR contract.

* [Stellar Echo Imaging of Exoplanets, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jrez-uhsk) - All stars exhibit intensity fluctuations over several time scales, from nanoseconds to days; these intensity fluctuations echo off planetary bodies in the star system and provide an opportunity to detect and possibly image exoplanets using modern computational imaging techniques. A mission utilizing stellar echo detectors could provide continent-level imaging of exoplanets more readily than interferometric techniques, as high temporal resolution detection is less technically challenging and more cost effective than multikilometer-baseline fringe-tracking, particularly in a photon-starved regime. The concept is also viable for survey missions for detecting exoplanets at more diverse orbital inclinations than is possible with transit or radial velocity techniques. Under a Phase I NIAC program, we evaluated the feasibility of the stellar echo technique and, while several practical constraints have been identified, we have not identified any fundamental limitations. We determined that the foundational technology already exists and has high TRL in space missions. Furthermore, the measurements required to demonstrate the feasibility of stellar echo detection are complementary to asteroseismology measurements, so a demonstration mission would provide high-value scientific information to other active astrophysics programs. Under the Phase II program, we will continue to advance the theoretical understanding of stellar echo imaging, improve on the computational methods developed in Phase I, evaluate specific hardware implementations, and ultimately produce a roadmap for the demonstration of stellar echo detection and imaging of exoplanets.
* [Advanced Pulse Compression System and Testbed, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6qdh-2q8h) - Future space-borne cloud radars will require significant technical innovations for improving remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planetary bodies such as Venus and Saturn's moon Titan, which have significant cloud cover. One critical innovation required is a pulse compression scheme at W-band (95 GHz) with ultra-low range sidelobe levels - on the order of 90 dB. The current space-borne cloud radar flying on CloudSat is an outstanding technical achievement but lacks sensitivity to weakly reflecting low altitude clouds. Because these clouds play a significant role in modulation the Earth's radiation budget follow-on missions will have to address this limitation. Pulse compression (coded) waveforms can maximize transmitter duty cycle usage and thus system sensitivity. However, the reflection from the Earth's surface can easily mask the cloud signal via the coded waveforms range sidelobe response. The requirement for detecting these clouds from space is severe and significant innovations are required to meet them. The proposed research addresses this requirement and is supported by staff who have significant experience in MMW system development, having built and flown the first airborne cloud radar utilizing FM chirp pulse compression.
* [A Ground-Based Analog for CNS Exposure to Space Radiation: A System for Integrating Microbeam Technology and Neuronal Culture](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4h7j-xvwv) - Problem Statement: The connection between radiation-induced neuronal damage and deficits in behavior and cellular function is still largely unknown. Previous studies on the effects of space-like radiation have lacked the technology to selectively irradiate individual cells in culture, much less individual cellular structures. Thus there is currently no way to observe how individual neurons respond to radiation-induced damage of specific cellular structures, which is critical to building the mechanistic link between radiation damage and physiological changes. Overall Goal: This project aims to develop a system utilizing particle microbeam technology and neuronal cell culture that can serve as a ground-based analog to neuron exposure to space radiation. This neuron-microbeam system will be used to investigate the molecular and cellular effects of high-energy particle radiation on the central nervous system. Background: Space radiation poses one of the least understood and least mitigated risks to humans traveling outside the protection of Earth's magnetic field. Previous radiation biology research has primarily focused on DNA damage and the resulting carcinogenesis risk, and this work has been largely concerned with low linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation such as gamma rays and X-rays. However, space radiation includes a variety of high atomic number, high-energy (HZE) ions that transfer large amounts of energy when traversing biological materials. A Mars trip would expose astronauts to a total of about 0.2 Gy of HZE ions. This dose is relatively small for low LET radiation, but HZE ions with a high LET can inflict significant biological damage even at this low dose. The long-standing radiation biology theory that DNA is the primary radiosensitive target in cells may not hold true for the central nervous system (CNS) in the low-fluence, high-energy charged particle radiation environment of space. Because much of the CNS consists of volumes containing mostly cellular processes and relatively few cell bodies, it is plausible that in low dose and dose rate conditions, only a small fraction of cells traversed by a charged particle will suffer damage to the nucleus. Thus the observed radiation-induced deficits are likely caused by the traversal of a particle through some extra-nuclear component of the cell. Research Plan: The early stages of this project will focus on developing a cell culture method for neurons that fits the tight constraints of the microbeam system. The new culture method will be evaluated by its ability to replicate previously observed changes in dendritic spine morphology and concentrations of cytoskeletal proteins. The latter stages of this project will focus on integrating this cell culture method with the particle microbeam at Columbia University's Radiological Research Accelerator Facility. A custom imaging and targeting protocol will be developed using fluorescent reporters and the microbeam facility's targeting system to selectively irradiate subcellular structures of individual neurons in neuronal cultures. Aim 1: Development of a neuronal culture procedure compatible with the particle microbeam system
Aim 2: Integration of microbeam targeting system and neuronal culture. Aim 3: Validation of neuron-microbeam system via selective irradiation of neuronal dendrites Impact: This project aims to create the technological capacity to investigate cellular responses to specific, subcellular radiation targets for the purpose of building the mechanistic link between radiation damage and deficits in health and performance. Having this capability will help address the knowledge gaps related to acute central nervous system exposure to space radiation. This work can also be adapted to address the radiation exposure of other tissue types and has the potential to impact earth-side endeavors, namely the treatment of brain tumors with high-energy charged particle radiation.
* [Tissue-Equivalent Radiation Dosimeter-On-A-Chip, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/saym-9rpx) - Available digital dosimeters are bulky and unable to provide real-time monitoring of dose for space radiation. The complexity of space-flight design requires reliable, fault-tolerant equipment capable of providing real-time dose readings during a mission, which is not feasible with the existing thermo-luminescent dosimeter (TLD) technology, especially during extravehicular activities (EVA). Real-time monitoring is important for low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and interplanetary space flight to alert the crew when Solar Particle Events (SPE) increase the particle flux of the spacecraft environment. The Phase-II project will design and fabricate a prototype Dosimeter-on-a-Chip (DoseChip) for personal dosimetry comprised of a tissue-equivalent scintillation crystal coupled to a solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM). The ubiquitous nature of CMOS technology provides a standardized development platform, and the ability to integrate the supporting electronics into a miniature, lightweight design.
The DoseChip provides a tissue-equivalent response to the relevant energies and types of radiation for low-Earth orbit and interplanetary space flight to the moon or Mars and will be sensitive to the dose rates and particle fluxes of ambient Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) to the higher rates of major SPE. The DoseChip will complement the existing Crew Passive Dosimeters by providing real-time dosimetry and as an alarming monitor for SPE.
* [Multi-Sensor Aerial Intrusion Detector, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/66b3-vwij) - NASA is seeking means to increase surveillance efficiency during mission launch operations. Launch delays are expensive, so any incremental increase in efficiency of launch range surveillance should produce large cost savings. To meet this requirement, Broadata Communications, Inc. (BCI) proposes to develop a new combined hardware and software sensor package for early intrusion detection called Multi-Sensor Aerial Intrusion Identifier that will be suitable for mounting in small UAVs of 10 feet wing span or less. The proposed intrusion detection system will be based on combining the output from three separate sensor systems: IR, Doppler Motion, and Stereo Video, to increase the reliability and sensor detection range compared to using any of these sensor systems on its own. The combined systems will have a 3-5 nautical mile forward detection range, compared to 1 nautical mile detection range for each individual sensor. It will produce a reduction of at least a factor of 3 in the number of small UAVs needed for launch range surveillance, and consequently, a dramatic reduction in the cost of surveillance. The UAVs will be equipped with warning sirens and warning lights to issue warnings to intruders, further automating launch range safety operations.
* [Advanced Ground Systems Maintenance Anomaly Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uf5b-v8n4) - <p>The Inductive Monitoring System (IMS) software utilizes techniques from the fields of model-based reasoning, machine learning, and data mining to build system monitoring knowledge bases from archived or simulated sensor data. Unlike some other machine learning techniques, IMS does not require examples of anomalous (failure) behavior. IMS automatically analyzes nominal system data to form general classes of expected system sensor values. This process enables the software to inductively learn and model nominal system behavior. The generated data classes are then used to build a monitoring knowledge base. In real-time,</p><p>IMS performs monitoring functions, determining and displaying the degree of deviation from nominal performance. IMS trend analyses can detect conditions that may indicate a failure or required system maintenance. The development of the IMS was motivated by the difficulty of producing detailed diagnostic models of some system components due to complexity or unavailability of design information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project will develop the capability to identify anomalous conditions (indications to potential impending system failure) in ground system operations before such failures occur. These indicators are not presently detectable by traditional command and control and fault detection systems. &nbsp;This project enables the delivery of system&#39;s health advisories to ground system operators so they can take action prior to experiencing systems failures.&nbsp;Inductive Monitoring System (IMS)&nbsp;detected&nbsp;anomalies can be sent to a diagnostic software&nbsp;module for diagnosis.</p><p>Anomaly Detection provides the 21st Century Launch Complex Program with the ability to identify/recognize systems&#39; anomalies before they become faults in the system; it supports the resolution of such anomalies to assure system availability and mission success. This capability also allows reduction in systems&#39; maintenance costs by dictating when maintenance is needed (Maintenance-on-Demand) versus performing maintenance on schedule.&nbsp;</p>
* [Ocean Color Underwater Low Light Advanced Radiometer—Ocean Color at Night](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yw4d-fs6h) - <p>The OCULLAR activity pairs a miniature and ruggedized photomultiplier tube (PMT) with an existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) silicon photodetector (SiP) microradiometer (co-developed by the PI as part of a prior SBIR) to create a new class of&nbsp; sensor technology called a <em>hybridnamic multitecto</em>r. A SiP microradiometer has a spectral responsivity spanning 305-1,640 nm with 10 decades of dynamic range and can be pointed at the Sun, Moon, sky, or sea without saturating. The principal OCULLAR objective is to increase this dynamic range to 14 decades with demonstrated linear calibration. The extra 6 decades of dynamic range from the PMT (2 overlap with the SiP, netting 14 decades) significantly improve the measurement of apparent optical properties (AOPs) under moonlight, which has already been demonstrated to be possible with existing SiP microradiometers, although there are challenges with ultraviolet (UV) channels. Increasing the dynamic range of the sensors will overcome the present limitations and allow unprecedented new research. For example, diurnal processes in the ocean and atmosphere can be studied optically using moonlight as the light source.</p> <p>The principal objective of the OCULLAR project is to pair a PMT with a SiP microradiometer where their overlapping sensitivities maximize the dynamic range at each wavelength to create a new hybrid sensor class, called a <em>hybridnamic multitecto</em>r.&nbsp; Ultimately, hybridnamic multitectors will feature up to 14 decades of dynamic range, spanning the UV to near-infrared (NIR), depending on the photocathode material of the PMT, and will be used to measure the AOPs of the ocean and atmosphere. AOP measurements, by definition, require a light source. Typically, the Sun is used because it provides sufficient flux across an extensive spectral domain for a wide diversity of detectors. Although some measurements have been made using the Moon as a light source, in general, the diurnal cycle of oceanic and atmospheric optical parameters are poorly understood, because of the paucity of instruments that can make high-quality observations in low-light conditions. Similarly, observations in highly turbid conditions are sparse, because signal levels quickly reach the noise level of existing detector systems. The inability to make accurate measurements at low-light levels has restricted the understanding of other important light-based phenomena. This means high latitude processes can be investigated during the substantial time of the year when light levels are restricted to twilight, moonlight, or very low solar elevations. Other areas of new research using OCULLAR sensors include the study of coral spawning, plankton vertical migration, bioluminescence, the onset of the spring bloom under polar ice sheets, characterization of the environment experienced by pelagic predators (e.g., tuna and squid), plus the use of very narrow bandwidths to exploit specific spectral signatures of oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Although the prototype sensor is anticipated to be deployed into the ocean, recent advances in exploiting microradiometers for airborne applications (e.g., C-AIR flights with Ames Research Center), suggests <em>Ocean Color at Night</em> or <em>Validating the Black Marble</em> using OCULLAR sensors are tractable problems.</p>
* [Intelligent Temporal Data Driven World Actuation in Ambient Environments Case Study: Anomaly Recognition and Assistance Provision in Smart Home](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bway-y43c) - Abstract — A possible resident of smart home is an old person or an Alzheimer patient that should be assisted continuously for the rest of his life; however, normally this person desires to live independently at home. Typically, this person may forget sometimes completion of the activities; may realize the activities of daily living incorrectly, and may enter to dangerous states. In this context smart home project is proposed as an ambient intelligent environment, in which on one hand the resident is observed continuously through the embedded sensors, and on the other hand the resident is assisted automatically through the embedded electronically controllable actuators. In this work, we propose an approach to interpret the sensors’ observations and how to automatically reason in the required assistance. The result is provision of automated assistance for the smart home resident.
* [Ground-Based Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) Observation Data (full-rate, daily, 24 hour files) from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jyds-z6r6) - This dataset consists of ground-based Satellite Laser Ranging observation data (full-rate, daily 24 hour files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). SLR provides unambiguous range measurements to mm precision that can be aggregated over the global network to provide very accurate satellite orbits, time histories of station position and motion, and many other geophysical parameters. SLR operates in the optical region and is the only space geodetic technique that measures unambiguous range directly. Analysis of SLR data contributes to the terrestrial reference frame, modeling of the spatial and temporal variations of the Earth's gravitational field, and monitoring of millimeter-level variations in the location of the center of mass of the total Earth system (solid Earth-atmosphere-oceans). In addition, SLR provides precise orbit determination for spaceborne radar altimeter missions. It provides a means for sub-nanosecond global time transfer, and a basis for special tests of the Theory of General Relativity. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) retrieve SLR data on regular schedules to produce precise station positions and velocities for stations in the ILRS network. The daily SLR full-rate observation files contain data received in the previous 24-hour period from a global network of stations ranging to satellites equipped with retroreflectors. Data are available in ILRS data format (older data sets) and/or the Consolidated Ranging Data (CRD) format. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/SLR/Full-rate_data.html.
* [Air-to-Air UAV Aerial Refueling](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fp2g-zn8q) - <p>Armstrong researchers, in cooperation with Northrop Grumman Corporation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) demonstrated autonomous aerial refueling between two unmanned, high-altitude aircraft. NASA's two Global Hawk UAVs, one outfitted as a receiver and the other as a tanker, flew a series of demonstration flights to validate advanced UAV-to-UAV aerial refueling control system technology. The two Global Hawk aircraft successfully flew for the first time as close as 30 feet in formation. In addition, the aircraft rendezvoused and flew for  more than 2.5 hours under autonomous formation control, the majority of time within 100 feet (or one wingspan) of each other. This research effort (referred to as the KQ-X project), is a follow-on to NASA's Autonomous Aerial Refueling Demonstration (AARD) project, in which manned aircraft operating on autopilot functioned as surrogate UAVs to test flight control and optical tracking systems. Work to date: The demonstration flights occurred between January and May 2012 and achieved many milestones. The lead receiver aircraft extended and retracted its aerial refueling hose several times, completing all planned tests to validate the associated program hardware and software. In addition, the trailing tanker aircraft successfully demonstrated precision control in formation with manual and automated "breakaway" maneuvers, which are important safety features and criteria of the test program. Looking ahead: Next steps involve further tests with unmanned aircraft. The team is looking for an industry partner to advance these development efforts. Partners: DARPA, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Sierra Nevada Corporation Benefits In-flight refueling: Allows UAVs to fulfill longer missions with longer flights Increased mission scope: Permits more flexibility in UAV use Long-term station keeping: Reduces the number of take-offs and landings to fulfill a given mission Automated refueling: Relieves pilots of burdensome flight refueling missions Applications UAV refueling Formation flight Automated manned aircraft refueling</p>
* [Detection of Life Forms, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2bnu-d57w) - Gaia Genomics proposes to develop an instrument for the detection of earthborn and/or planetary life forms that are based on a nucleic acid paradigm. Highly sensitive reagents will be developed to detect DNA- or RNA-based organisms. The components of the proposed system are simple, rugged, stable, and inexpensive, and detection will be both rapid and highly sensitive. In Phase I, we will synthesize the diagnostic reagents and demonstrate proof-of-concept by their ability to detect nucleic acids. In Phase II, they will be incorporated into a portable prototype instrument designed for single- or multi-sample detection. The resulting device will be ideal for use as a survey tool for NASA Astrobiology interplanetary missions (Topic S4, Sub-topic 05).
* [Wideband Radio Frequency Interference Detection for Microwave Radiometer Subsystem](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gnsu-dxsb) - Anthropogenic Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) is threatening the quality and utility of multi-frequency passive microwave radiometry. The GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission launched on February 27, 2014 is already seeing RFI in the 10.7 and 18.7 GHz channels. It is important to understand that these frequency bands are strictly protected for science data measurement; yet, it is still corrupted by RFI. Indeed, this issue has led to the development of the first spaceborne digital RFI mitigation radiometer operating at 1.4 GHz for the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission. We leverage our experience on SMAP to develop innovative technology for wider-bandwidth higher-frequency radiometers. The objective of this proposal is to develop a wideband (200-1000 MHz) digital detector subsystem and to demonstrate innovative RFI detection and removal techniques for microwave radiometers. The techniques proposed, complex valued kurtosis detector and independent component analysis (ICA), have the potential to improve the RFI detection rate in high frequency bandwidth. We are responding to a national imperative to develop RFI mitigation technology for future spaceflight radiometers. "Spectrum Management for the Twenty-first Century" recommends the continued development of so-called non-cooperative mitigation technologies. The Earth Science Technology roadmap for Advanced Microwave Components and Systems seeks “Demonstration of RFI mitigation approaches, and algorithms for future RFI environments to 40 GHz and beyond.” These two National Research Council reports emphasize the importance of RFI mitigation technology for sustaining a reliable national passive microwave remote sensing capability.
* [Diagnosis-Driven Prognosis for Decision Making, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tay5-acps) - One cannot build a system-level Prognosis and Health Management (PHM) solution by cobbling together a bunch of existing prognostic techniques; it will have a very high rate of false-positive indications. On the other hand, if a system-level health management solution could identify the individual degradations and indictors associated with those degradations, and thereby decouple the problem into smaller pieces, the existing prognostic techniques could still be used to predict time to failure, and could therefore drive an effective Condition Based Maintenance and Decision Support System (CBM+). Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI) and Vanderbilt University team seeks to develop a system-level diagnostic and prognostic process and a "sense and respond capability" which first uses error codes and discrete sensor values to correctly diagnose the system health including degradations and failures of sensors and components, and then invoke appropriate prognostic routines for assessment of remaining life and capability. Thus, QSI's Testability Engineering And Maintenance System (TEAMS) real-time reasoner will enable the use of many existing prognostics techniques in the broader context by decomposing the complex system into local datasets of degradations and associated sensor data sets, thereby limiting the problem-space for the prognostic techniques to their limited design scope. Indeed, it is well established in the contexts of parameter estimation and model-based fault identification (i.e., fault isolation and severity estimation) that feature selection and diagnosis, respectively, followed by parameter estimation provides major improvements in estimation performance (measured in terms of computational time as well as the standard deviations of the estimated parameters) when compared to full parameter estimation which provides biased estimates for all the parameters.
* [PROBABILITY CALIBRATION BY THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PROBABILITY SCORES IN ONE-CLASS BAYES LEARNING FOR ANOMALY DETECTION](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2mm5-p3cz) - PROBABILITY CALIBRATION BY THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PROBABILITY SCORES IN ONE-CLASS BAYES LEARNING FOR ANOMALY DETECTION GUICHONG LI, NATHALIE JAPKOWICZ, IAN HOFFMAN, R. KURT UNGAR ABSTRACT. One-class Bayes learning such as one-class Naïve Bayes and one-class Bayesian Network employs Bayes learning to build a classifier on the positive class only for discriminating the positive class and the negative class. It has been applied to anomaly detection for identifying abnormal behaviors that deviate from normal behaviors. Because one-class Bayes classifiers can produce probability score, which can be used for defining anomaly score for anomaly detection, they are preferable in many practical applications as compared with other one-class learning techniques. However, previously proposed one-class Bayes classifiers might suffer from poor probability estimation when the negative training examples are unavailable. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the probability estimation. The improved one-class Bayes classifiers can exhibits high performance as compared with previously proposed one-class Bayes classifiers according to our empirical results.
* [High Efficiency Solar Cell on Low Cost Metal Foil Substrate, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/527n-8nui) - Future space missions will require Solar cell arrays having specific power ratings in excess of 1000 W/kg. Conventional crystalline photovoltaic technology comprised of epitaxial photovoltaic semiconductor materials grown on single crystal semiconductor substrates, cannot provide these specific ratings. We propose to synthesize nano-precursors of solar cell materials of uniform size by Solvo-thermal process. These nano-precursors will be deposited as nano-thin film on low cot and flexible metal foil substrate by Electrophoretic technique. Through subsequent , insitu annealing, thin films with grain size >50 microns will be produced. GaAs, Ge and InP will be investigated to determine which material can be deposited as high quality large grain thin film without contamination. The synthesized nano-precursors, electrphoretically deposited nano-thin film and large grain thin film produced after annealing will be fully characterized. A combination of crystalline thin film photovoltaic layers having an efficiency of just 25% fabricated on low cost, light weight flexible substrate such as a metal foil, would yield a specific power rating of >1200 W/kg. During Phase II multi-junction solar cell will be grown on the large grain thin film produced during Phase I on flexible/low cost metal foil substrate.
* [Further Development of Aperture: A Precise Extremely large Reflective Telescope Using Re-configurable Elements](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4nx6-jgdh) - One of the pressing needs for space ultraviolet-visible astronomy is a design to allow larger mirrors than the James Webb Space Telescope primary. The diameter of the rocket fairing limits the mirror diameter such that all future missions calling for mirrors up to 16 m in diameter or larger will require a mirror that is deployed post-launch. In response to the deployment requirement, we address the issues of this concept called "A Precise Extremely large Reflective Telescope Using Reconfigurable Elements (APERTURE) with both hardware experiments and software simulations. APERTURE will use a deployable membrane-like mirror. The mirror figure will be corrected after deployment to bring it into better or equal lambda/20 deviations from the prescribed mirror shape, where lambda (typically 400 nm-1 micron) is the operational wavelength. Instead of using the classical piezoelectric-patch technology, our concept is based on a continuous coating of a Magnetic Smart Material (MSM). We expect that the initially deployed mirror will not have a perfect figure. Thus our design uses magnetic write heads to produce stress in the MSM and improve the figure, post deployment. This Phase II NIAC proposal is to address two of the tall poles in the concept: (a) Can corrections on a large size be made and retained for a long enough time (> 1 week); (b) Can deployment be done in such a way that the figures corrections are small enough to be correctable via the MSM plus magnetic field, and at the same time, the in plane stresses as small enough to allow the stresses resulting magnetic field injected into the MSM plus magnetic fields to make the necessary corrections. Tall pole “a” will be primarily the responsibility of Northwestern University (NU) and “b” of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. NU will carry out overall scientific leadership and will coordinate and solicit input from GSFC, JPL, and NIST.
* [Intelligent Flamefinder Detection and Alert System (IFDAS), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j876-witj) - NASA test and launch facilities, such as those at Stennis, Marshall, and other locations, require large amounts of hydrogen as a primary rocket fuel; hydrogen is also of growing interest in the private sector. Unfortunately, hydrogen burns with an essentially invisible flame, making detection of hydrogen fires difficult. Current methods of detecting hydrogen leaks and fires are limited in a number of ways; video-based methods (IR and otherwise) are promising, but can be seriously misled by reflections and currently require human operators (increasing expense and leading to problems of attentiveness). To address these and other challenges, IEM proposes to create the Intelligent Flamefinder<SUP>TM</SUP> Detection and Alert System (IFDAS). Drawing on smart video analysis and other smart sensor work for NASA, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Navy, and others, and building on an exclusive license of patented NASA technology, IEM will create a smart hydrogen fire detection system which will reliably detect even small (less than 3") flames, ignore false signals from reflections of flames, the sun, or other heat/light sources, accurately determine the location of the flames, and automatically alert the appropriate individuals or systems of the existence, extent, and location of the fire, without the need for human operators or intervention prior to the alert. IFDAS will also be able to interface with current sensing systems and integrate their data to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation using all available data. The individual units will be compact, low-power, and rugged, for use indoors or outdoors, and be applicable for uses in NASA, the military, and commercial enterprises involving hydrogen or other flammable materials which have difficult-to-detect flames.
* [RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of reactive oxygen species gene network in Mizuna plants grown in long-term space flight](https://data.nasa.gov/d/af4u-mnh4) - Space environment is suspected to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce oxidative stress in plants however little is known about the gene expression of ROS gene network in plants grown in long-term space flight. RNA-Seq was used to define the large-scale gene expression profiles of Mizuna harvested after 27 days cultivation in the international space station to understand the molecular response and adaptation to space environment.Results: Total reads of transcripts from the Mizuna grown in the international space station as well as on the ground by RNA-Seq using next generation sequencing technology showed 8,258 and 14,170 transcripts up- and down-regulated in the space-grown Mizuna respectively when compared with those from the ground-grown Mizuna. A total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative marker genes were up-regulated including high expression of 4 hallmarks and preferentially expressed gene associated with ROS-scavenging genes was thioredoxin glutaredoxin and alternative oxidase genes. In the transcription factors of ROS gene network MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 OXI1-MKK4-MPK3 and OXI1-MPK3 of MAP cascades induction of WRKY22 by MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 cascade induction of WRKY25 and repression of ZAT7 by Zat12 were suggested. RbohD and RbohF genes were up-regulated preferentially in NADPH oxidase genes which produce ROS.Conclusions: Our large-scale transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the space environment induced oxidative stress and ROS gene network was activated in the space-grown Mizuna some of which were common genes up-regulated by abiotic and biotic stress and were preferentially up-regulated genes by the space environment even though Mizuna grew in the space as well as on the ground showing that plants could acclimate to the space environment by reprograming the expression of ROS gene network.
* [Remote Data Exploration with the Interactive Data Language, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5pm2-x74e) - We propose to develop a tool for NASA researchers based on IDL and DAP for user-friendly remote data access. A popular data analysis tool in the NASA research community is IDL (Interactive Data Language). A main limitation presently on performing data analysis with IDL for NASA researchers is that often the data to analyze is located remotely from the scientist, and also, often the data is too large to transfer for local analysis. Researchers have developed a protocol for accessing remote data, the Data Access Protocol (DAP), and one can use DAP from within IDL, but presently using the DAP-IDL interface is both limited and cumbersome. We propose to develop a more powerful, user-friendly interface to DAP for IDL. At the completion of this work, users will be able to browse remote data sets from an IDL GUI, have an interactive IDL command line session simultaneous with the remote visualization and write custom IDL functions that will act on the remote data with results displayed locally. We will make all of these IDL-DAP tools usable seamlessly for any IDL user.

* [Bringing 3D Memory Cubes to Space: a "Rad-Hard by Design Study" with an Open Architecture, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f2n3-h4a6) - The computing capabilities of onboard spacecraft are a major limiting factor for accomplishing many classes of future missions. Although technology development efforts are underway that will provide improvements to spacecraft CPUs, they do not address the limitations of current onboard memory systems. In addition to CPU upgrades, effective execution of data-intensive operations such as terrain relative navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning and scheduling, and onboard science data processing and analysis require high-bandwidth, low-latency memory systems to maximize processor usage (the memory wall) and provide rapid access to observational data captured by high-data-rate instruments (e.g., Hyperspectral Infrared Imager, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar).
3D ICs, after a long wait, is now a reality. The first mainstream product is 3D memory cubes, where multiple memory tiers (4 DRAM tiers as of 2015) are vertically integrated to offer manifold improvement in size, capacity, speed, and power consumption compared with 2D counterparts. Indeed, these are the memory parts that will truly enable aforementioned missions. Unfortunately, none of these are ready for space. The purpose of this research is to investigate the challenges and opportunities in deploying 3D memory cubes into space missions.
* [Compact Sensor for Isotope and Trace Gas Analysis, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ddt5-icwp) - We propose to develop and demonstrate a new sensor platform for isotope and trace-gas analysis that is appropriate for future planetary missions. Among other applications, the technology can enable the collection of isotope ratio data in support of the search for evidence of life within the solar system. Current limitations to in-situ isotope measurements will be overcome by utilizing a capillary absorption spectrometer (CAS). This concept enables high precision measurements within the ultra-small volume (~ 0.1 ml) of a hollow fiber optic capillary and has proven to be three orders of magnitude more sensitive than competing sensors. The proposed effort focuses on transitioning the current lab-based technique to a small size, weight, and power (SWaP) device that can be operated unattended. In Phase I, proposed concepts for improving the system performance, reducing the SWaP, and engineering a field-capable device were proven and specific options down selected. Under Phase II, we will fully develop a general prototype sensor platform, which is applicable to a wide range of isotope ratio and trace-gas analysis applications. Specific examples of the utility and versatility of the concept will be demonstrated by using the system as a stand-alone gas sensor, as well as in combination with both a laser ablation sampler and a gas chromatograph. In addition, a dual laser system will be developed to measure both Carbon (C) and Sulfur (S) isotope ratios. The sensitivity afforded by the proposed system would open up remote analysis of smaller samples than ever before measured, which could be a significant development in the search for biosignatures on other planets and near space objects, as well as in the early Earth rock record.
* [Pyramid Nanostructured Coatings for Stray Light Suppression, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yv3r-xaps) - State of the Art In-Space Telescopic imagery suffers from deleterious effects of image quality due to radiation, in the form of stray visible light. While treatments to reduce the impact of stray light exist, the effectiveness of these treatments have limitations thereby limiting the range and reliability of astrophysical telescopic imagery. NASA is seeking a scalable, highly effective solution to reduce and/or eliminate the impact of stray light.
Applied Sciences, Inc. (ASI) proposes Applied Sciences proposes a unique solution for stray light suppression in space flight instruments. The innovation utilizes non-reflective/ nano-structured polymer coatings combined with a proven and scalable process that yields a light trapping nano-textured surface. Stacked-cup carbon nanotubes will provide additional absorptive properties to a currently-used aerospace qualified resin system (legacy material). A non-reflecting surface will be fabricated by plasma etching and replication into pyramidal nanostructures for broadband absorption with efficiency at or better than 99.9%. This new approach comes at a much lower cost, is readily scalable and safer than the competing technology. ASI has previous success formulating spray-able room temperature cured coatings with tailored reflectivity and is working with U.S. Air Force to scale-up the nanomaterial enhanced coatings manufacturing capability. That separate effort, and the use of a (modified/enhanced-) legacy material, will benefit the proposed effort as it will enable rapid verification, qualification, and transition of the technology.
* [Hybrid Heat Pipes for High Heat Flux Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qqei-vg7s) - The thermal transport requirements for future spacecraft missions continue to increase, approaching several kilowatts. At the same time the heat acquisition areas have trended downward, thereby increasing the incident heat flux. Current incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2. This is a severe limitation for axial groove aluminum/ammonia constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs). The maximum heat flux in a CCHP is set by the boiling limit, which typically start at 5 W/cm2 for axial grove wicks, and 20-30 W/cm2 for powder metal wicks. The innovation is to develop CCHPs with either a sintered wick, or a hybrid grooved and sintered wick. A hybrid grooved and sintered wick CCHP will allow operating at higher heat fluxes as compared to axial groove design and can also operate against gravity on the planetary surface, operate in space, carrying power over long distances, act as a thermosyphon on the planetary surface for Lunar and Martian landers and rovers, and demonstrate a higher transport capability than an all-sintered wick.
* [An Innovative Solution to NASA's NEO Impact Threat Mitigation Grand Challenge and Flight Validation Mission Architecture Development](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cf65-uyyd) - <p>A Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle (HAIV) mission architecture, which blends a hypervelocity kinetic impactor with a subsurface nuclear explosion for optimal fragmentation and dispersion of hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs), has been developed through a 2011 NIAC Phase I study. Despite the uncertainties inherent to the nuclear disruption approach, disruption can become an effective strategy if most fragments disperse at speeds in excess of the escape velocity of an asteroid so that a very small number of fragments impacts the Earth. Thus, the proposed HAIV system will become essential for reliably mitigating the most probable impact threat: NEOs with warning times shorter than 10 years. It offers a potential breakthrough or great leap in mission capabilities for mitigating the impact threat of NEOs. The proposed Phase II study further develops the HAIV-based mission architecture and explores its potential infusion options within NASA and beyond.</p>

* [Aircraft Control Augmentation and Health Monitoring Using FADS Technology, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kbcy-nir6) - This Phase I research proposal is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of an innovative architecture comprising control augmentation and on-line health monitoring system. This architecture integrats Flush Air Data System (FADS) with Reconfigurable Generalized Predictive Control (RGPC) technologies. The Phase 1 effort includes identification and description of all supporting modules, their functionality and associated algorithm structures, connectivity, and final simulations using a specific aircraft for system performance evaluations. Proof-of-concept study will include demonstrating the capability using selected aircraft health degradation and/or failure situations. The concept innovation is derived from the prognostic nature of the system feedback used by the controller for applying corrective aircraft control. In traditional controllers the errant transients possessing loss of control potential are detected after the fact and corrective actions for recovery are commanded by controller posteriori. The proposed system performs a real-time autonomous monitoring of aircraft surface pressure fields that contain precursor information for prediction of incipient errant transient motions. The proposed system will enable reconfiguration of control based on measured pressure field anomalies that indicate standard control system equipment malfunctions.
* [Neural Network Enhanced Structure Determination of Osteoporosis, Immune System, and Radiation Repair Proteins, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k6us-47ff) - We propose a dual objective innovation that has valuable NASA applicability and tremendous commercial potential.

The long-term results from this innovation could provide effective medical countermeasures for bone loss, immune system compromise and harmful radiation effects seen in astronauts upon long-duration space missions. The second innovation is a commercial grade multipurpose neural network based informatics system configurable for automated, real-time sensory data input and automatic correlation identification applicable to autonomous astronaut health monitoring and environmental correlation. This innovation also has significant commercial applications in the health care industries as a hospital wide health monitoring and environmental correlation system.
* [Virtual Sensor Test Instrumentation, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/m8r8-ynv7) - Mobitrum has started the development of virtual sensor test instrumentation in Phase I for characterization and measurement of ground testing of propulsion systems. It is clear that future wide availability of smart sensors will significantly reduce the cost and time required to design, repair, or modify sensor systems through modular and re-configurable capability. The Phase II effort will complete the development of: 1) common sensor interface, (2) microprocessor, (3) wireless interface, (4) signal conditioning and ADC/DAC, and (5) on-board EEPROM for metadata storage and executable software to create powerful, scalable, re-configurable, and reliable distributed test instrument. The transducer senses the physical quantity being measured and converts it into an electrical signal. Then the signal is fed to an A/D converter, and is ready for use by the processor to execute functional transformation based on the sensor characteristics stored in TEDS. In order to maximize the data efficiency, a plug-and-play is required to interface with traditional sensors to enhance their identity and capabilities for data processing and communications. Virtual sensor test instrumentation is built upon open-system architecture with standardized protocol modules/stacks easily to interface with industry standards and commonly used software such as IEEE 1451, MATLAB, and LabVIEW.

The goal is to find a low-cost way of building a telescope for hard X-rays with a very large effective area.<p/><p>The project is to build a grazing incidence mirror for hard X-rays (E>20 keV) using a "scotch-tape" design, in which a thin plastic tape with a specific thickness profile and a multilayer reflective coating is tightly wound into a roll. Key challenges are (a) to find a suitably smooth tape subatrate (this has been done), (b) to wind a large number of tape shells onto the smooth metal centerpiece without introducing and accummulating shape irregularities, and (c) to give the tape the variable thickness profile in order to achieve the desired optical figure. Our immediate goal is to demonstrate the idea feasibility by building a crude conical X-ray concentrator.

* [Versatile Attitude Control Actuators for Sub-Milliarcsecond Precision Pointing, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/iein-vmfn) - Growing scientific and practical needs exist for precision spacecraft pointing at milliarcsec (mas) levels. Present state-of-the-art reaction wheels, or similar, actuators introduce vibrational jitter and can ultimately drive pointing error. Busek electrospray thrusters aboard the ESA LISA Pathfinder mission have recently demonstrated nm scale position control. The proposed system will provide vibration-free sub-mas pointing control through integration of follow-on innovations and new deployable boom technologies. Recent thruster innovations have dramatically increased maximum thrust, while retaining control resolution, and reduced propellant loads through increased specific impulse. These gains will be applied in this work to replace reaction wheel actuators for both precision control and slew maneuvers. Accordingly, actuator induced vibrations are virtually eliminated while body pointing will be dramatically improved; resulting in major reductions in ACS SWaP and in the complexity of vibration compensating controllers/active sensors. With applications to, for example, observation and laser communication missions these benefits would both enable high-capability but reduced cost spacecraft and pave the way for new, presently, unobtainable levels of control authority on large spacecraft. Phase I will emphasize acquisition and analysis of precision thrust control measurements using the BET-1mN thruster-head which, uniquely, can be operated in either a high thrust, low Isp, or low thrust, high Isp configuration. The associated complex performance map will be analyzed in the context of highly quiescent ACS needs. These data will then be applied to define necessary control, circuitry and mechanical requirements needed to realize the full-attitude control potential of the technology. A conceptual system level design performed in collaboration with ROCCOR will outline strategies to overcome required developments and produce a complete system demonstration in Phase II.

* [System-Level Development of Fault-Tolerant Distributed Aero-Engine Control Architecture, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e3pd-w3bw) - NASA's vision for an "intelligent engine" will be realized with the development of a truly distributed control system and reliable smart transducer node components; however a significant hurdle in its realization is the reliability of these components when subjected to the harsh operating environment throughout the engine. In this Phase I award, Impact Technologies, in collaboration with GE Aviation, will develop a fault-tolerant smart transducer node through a Distributed Engine Control Simulator (DECSim) design tool that will utilize a commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) open-system communications standard and will interface with the C-MAPSS engine model. In Phase I, Impact will successfully develop: i) the DECSim utility, ii) the smart node self-validation and cross-validation capabilities, iii) the overall distributed control architecture, and iv) the firmware code that will reside on hardware. At the end of the Phase I program, Impact will demonstrate the functionality of a candidate DEC smart node in hardware within the DECSim framework. The final smart node technology will alleviate the severe system-level limitations of current centralized architectures that include a large weight imposition, limited design flexibility, and life cycle cost burdens associated with certification and obsolescence management.

hours. Modern Hall-effect thrusters (HETs) are a proven technology with
flight heritage, established manufacturing readiness and testing
channels that nearly meet the desired specifications (as shown in Figure
1). However, the major limitation is that HETs fail to achieve all four
of objectives simultaneously. This Phase I feasibility study is focused
on a proof-of-concept experiment to alleviate the HET dual-mode
operational envelope limitation for both high thrust-to-power and high
specific impulse. Starfire Industries believes that a &quot;low
hanging fruit&quot; modification to HETs exists, and such an improvement
would be evolutionary to enable multi-mission EP systems for NASA's
Science Mission Directorate and DoD platforms. Towards this end,
Starfire has partnered with Aerojet Corporation to rapidly demonstrate
feasibility in Phase I through experimental modification to an existing
HET system. If results are confirmed, a Phase II design can be driven
to yield immediate upgrades for flight-qualified HET systems for
near-term payback.
* [Lightweight Pump Technology for Advanced Green Monopropellants, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jeyj-qgde) - Systima will develop an innovative light weight self-pressurizing pump (SPP) technology to provide a constant-pressure supply of monopropellant to a spacecraft or tactical propulsion system. The SPP does not require a helium tank and higher operating pressure have a negligible impact on the system mass. Since the SPP has a lower weight than comparable propellant pressurization systems, it provides an opportunity for reducing launch costs, increasing spacecraft or tactical system payload capacity and significantly enhancing delta velocity/λV. This technology can be used with hydrazine, HAN-based, or ADN-based propellants as there are no known limitations on the monopropellant that can be used in the system. The self-pressurizing lightweight pump for advanced monopropellants offers significant advantages in applications where a large λV is required, such as large spacecraft or in applications where high-pressure is needed, such as liquid ACS or DACS thrusters. The Phase I and Phase II SBIR will focus on development of the system for operation with the HAN-based monopropellant AF-M315E.
* [Consistent Practices for Characterizing the Detection Limits of Fracture Critical Metallic Component Inspection Systems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/26qi-7eef) - <p>NASA-STD-5009 requires that successful flaw detection by NDE methods be statistically qualified for use on fracture critical metallic components using Probability of Detection (POD) studies, but does not standardize practices. This task works towards standardizing calculations and record retention with a web-based tool, the NASA POD Standards Library, or NPSL. Best practices for test methods and specimen storage will also be provided&nbsp;with appendices to NASA-STD-5009, which is currently unded revision.&nbsp;Additionally, this appendix will describe how POD specimens used to qualify NDE systems will be cataloged, stored and protected from corrosion, damage, or loss.</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Flaw detection capability&nbsp;is established for inspection systems on the basis of Probability of Detection (POD).&nbsp; The commonly accepted metric for an adequate inspection system is as follows:&nbsp;for a minimum flaw size which is smaller than the critical defect being sought,&nbsp;there is 90% probability of detection with 95% confidence (90/95 POD). &nbsp;Inspection systems that are incapable of meeting the 90/95 POD requirement at or below the critical defect level for fracture critical components are deemed&nbsp;unsuitable for that inspection. &nbsp;</p><p>To provide an efficient and accurate methodology that yields estimates of POD and confidence bounds for&nbsp;Hit-Miss or signal amplitude testing the directed design of experiments for probability of detection (DOEPOD) method has been developed.&nbsp; In DOEPOD, signal amplitudes are reduced to Hit-Miss data by defining a signal threshold.&nbsp; The directed DOEPOD method uses&nbsp;a nonparametric approach for the analysis of inspection data which, unlike other methods,&nbsp;does not rely on simlifying assumptions regarding&nbsp;the&nbsp;general form of a POD function.&nbsp; This differs with other methods&nbsp;that define a POD&nbsp;curve based on a curve fit and does not assume increasing detection with increasing flaw sizes that can often be proven untrue.&nbsp; For a given sample set, the DOEPOD procedure identifies whether&nbsp;the minimum requirement of 90% probability of detection with 95% confidence is demonstrated for a minimum flaw size and for all greater flaw sizes (90/95 POD).&nbsp; These procedures are sequentially executed&nbsp;to minimize the number of samples needed to demonstrate that there is a 90/95 POD lower confidence bound at a given flaw size and that the POD is monotonic for flaw sizes exceeding that 90/95 POD flaw size.</p><p>This work provides strong experimental and simulation evidence that&nbsp;a 90/95 POD flaw size will be identified by DOEPOD 95% of the time if it exists, and the procedures will yield a determination that the POD is non-monotonic 97% of the time when it is non-monotonic.&nbsp; Based on this evidence, the DOEPOD methodology may be used to reduce mission risk by quantifiably meeting the requirements of NASA-STD-5009, &ldquo;Nondestructive Evaluation Requirements for Fracture Critical Metallic Components.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Approach</strong></p><p>A total of 860 metal specimens have been produced with a selection of fatigue cracks, fastener hole cracks, lack of weld fusion, and electrical discharge machined (EDM) flaws. &nbsp;The metals used in this study are common throughout aerospace, and include aluminum, titanium, nickel-chromium alloy, and stainless steel. &nbsp;Flat plates and tubes with programmed defects are being&nbsp;examined.&nbsp; These specimens are being examined&nbsp;with x-ray radiography with differing film densities, digital radiography, ultrasound (including phased array), eddy current (including automated methods), florescent penetrant testing (L3 &amp; L4), magnetic particle testing, and visual testing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customers</strong></p><p>All NASA centers and missions utilizing failure critical components.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Products</strong></p
* [High Capacity, High Efficiency 10 to 20 K Pulse Tube Cryocooler, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ishz-y7jg) - Closed-cycle cryocooler alternatives currently available for space applications in the temperature range of 10 to 20 K are not well suited to the requirements of such applications. In many cases reliability is low and vibration high. In other cases, coolers are too massive and inefficient. However, such coolers are often important components in enabling many of the advanced sensor and detector technologies of the future. This proposal describes a two-stage pulse tube cooler (PTC) that combines a bootstrap staging configuration with an innovative second-stage design to deliver cooling in the range of 10 to 20 K. The proposed cooler contains four innovative concepts that together will overcome the limitations of current cryocooler technologies and improve efficiency while simultaneously reducing mass.
* [Task-Specific Asteroid Simulants for Ground Testing, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/efuk-z4ht) - The project will produce at least four asteroid simulants at high fidelity for mineral content and particle size, created through standardized inputs and documented processes. In addition to making simulant available at moderate cost compared to duplicative individual efforts, this initial library of pedigreed asteroid simulants will enable researchers and technology developers to compare their results with others using the library, and with their own previous experiments using the library. The downside of uncoordinated, undocumented, dissimilar simulants is the wasting of time and financial resources, as well as the risk of misleading results from the use of inappropriate or low-fidelity materials.

This dataset consists of the set of daytime geotiff images from Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 provided to Geological Survey of Alabama for their analysis. Subsetted coordinates are 31-27N latitude and 90-84.25W longitude (Gulf of Mexico coastline in Alabama and portions of Florida). These are seasonal data for storms.
* [LBA-ECO LC-03 Hypsography, Rivers, Roads, and DEM, Four Areas across Brazilian Amazon](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dvnw-xjc7) - This data set provides four related spatial data products for four study areas across the Brazilian Amazon: Manaus, Amazonas; Tapajos National Forest, Para Western (Santarem); Rio Branco, Acre; and Rondonia, Rondonia. Products include vector data showing (1) roads, (2) rivers, and (3) hypsography and (4) digital elevation model (DEM) images that were encoded from the hypsography vectors. There are 15 data files with this data set which includes 12 compressed *.zip files containing ArcInfo shape files and 3 GeoTIFFS.This data set contains vector data showing roads, rivers, and hypsography for each study area in ESRI ArcGIS shapefile format. The vectors were hand-digitized by the Images Company in Brazil from paper maps produced by the Brazilian government. Depending on the scale of the original maps, the digitization errors vary. For some maps, some vectors are missing. Data were manually checked for duplicate or extra vectors. These data sets were derived from several map sheets produced from aerial coverages dating from 1974 to 1978.The DEM images were encoded from the hypsography vectors and are provided in GeoTIFF format. The attribute value associated with each line and point in the vector segment is encoded into the image channel; the image channel is then filled in by interpolating image data between encoded vector data. For each DEM: 1 image channel with pixel resolution = 25m x 25m. DEM images are provided for Manaus, Tapajos National Forest, and Rondonia. The files for Rio Branco were unusable due to a documentation error.DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products. KNOWN PROBLEMS:The data providers note that due to limited resources, these data have been neither validated nor quality-assured for general use. For that reason, extreme caution is advised when considering the use of these data. - Any use of the derived data is not recommended because the results have not been validated.- However, the DEM, vectors, and orthorectified SAR data (related data set) can be used if the user understands how these were produced and accepts the limitations.
* [SAFARI 2000 Surface Irradiance Measurements, Mongu Tower Site, Zambia, 2000-2002](https://data.nasa.gov/d/eqs5-thym) - ABSTRACT: This data set contains the top-of-canopy irradiance in the shortwave (0.3-2.8 micron) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 0.4-0.7 micron) wavebands collected with an Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometer (PSP) and a Skye SKE510 pyranometer, respectively. The instruments were deployed at the top of the 30-m tower in the Kataba Local Forest approximately 20 km south of Mongu in Western Province, Zambia. The data include the hourly mean and maximum values from 0500-1600 GMT (7 a.m. - 6 p.m. local time) and cover the period from September 4, 2000 to December 31, 2002. The data were obtained primarily for EOS validation and energy budget modeling.The Skye SKE510 uses a blue enhanced planar diffused silicon detector and has a fairly even response from 400 to 700 nm. The Eppley PSP is a World Meteorological Organization First Class Radiometer designed for the measurement of sun and sky radiation, totally or in defined broad wavelength bands. It comprises a circular multi-junction wire-wound thermopile. A data logger sampled the sensors at 60-second intervals and recorded the maximum and mean values every 60 minutes throughout the day.The data are contained within a single ASCII text file, in comma-separated-value format, with associated date, time, and QA information.
* [JAWS: Justified AWS-like data through workflow enhancements that ease access and add scientific value](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qckz-tpbc) - Automated Weather Station and AWS-like networks are the primary source of surface-level meteorological data in remote polar regions. These networks have developed organically and independently, and deliver data to researchers in idiosyncratic ASCII formats that hinder automated processing and intercomparison among networks. Moreover, station tilt causes significant biases in polar AWS measurements of radiation and wind direction. Researchers, network operators, and data centers would benefit from AWS-like data in a common format, amenable to automated analysis, and adjusted for known biases. This project addresses these needs by developing a scientific software workflow called "Justified AWS" (JAWS) to ingest Level 2 (L2) data in the multiple formats now distributed, harmonize it into a common format, and deliver value-added Level 3 (L3) output suitable for distribution by the network operator, analysis by the researcher, and curation by the data center. Polar climate researchers currently face daunting problems including how to easily: 1. Automate analysis (subsetting, statistics, unit conversion) of AWS-like L2 ASCII data. 2. Combine or intercompare data and data quality from among unharmonized L2 datasets. 3. Adjust L2 data for biases such as AWS tilt angle and direction. JAWS addresses these common issues by harmonizing AWS L2 data into a common format, and applying accepted methods to quantify quality and estimate biases. Specifically, JAWS enables users and network operators to 1. Convert L2 data (usually ASCII tables) into a netCDF-based L3 format compliant with metadata conventions (Climate-Forecast and ACDD) that promote automated discovery and analysis. 2. Include value-added L3 features like the Retrospective, Iterative, Geometry-Based (RIGB) tilt angle and direction corrections, solar angles, and standardized quality flags. 3. Provide a scriptable API to extend the initial L2-to-L3 conversion to newer AWS-like networks and instruments. Polar AWS network experts and NSIDC DAAC personnel, each with decades of experience, will help guide and deliberate the L3 conventions implemented in Stages 2-3.
The project will start on July 1, 2017 at entry Technology Readiness Level 3 and will exit on June 30, 2019 at TRL 6. JAWS is now a heterogeneous collection of scripts and methods developed and validated at UCI over the past 15 years. At exit, JAWS will comprise three modular stages written in or wrapped by Python, installable by Conda: Stage 1 ingests and translates L2 data into netCDF. Stage 2 annotates the netCDF with CF and ACDD metadata. Stage 3 derives value-added scientific and quality information. The labor-intensive tasks include turning our heterogeneous workflow into a robust, standards-compliant, extensible workflow with an API based on best practices of modern scientific information systems and services. Implementation of Stages 1-2 may be straightforward though tedious due to the menagerie of L2 formats, instruments, and assumptions. The RIGB component of Stage 3 requires ongoing assimilation of ancillary NASA data (CERES, AIRS) and use of automated data transfer protocols (DAP, THREDDS).
The immediate target recipient elements are polar AWS network managers, users, and data distributors. L2 borehole data suffers from similar interoperability issues, as does non-polar AWS data. Hence our L3 format will be extensible to global AWS and permafrost networks. JAWS will increase in situ data accessibility and utility, and enable new derived products (both are AIST goals). The PI is a long-standing researcher, open source software developer, and educator who understands obstacles to harmonizing disparate datasets with NASA interoperability recommendations. Our team participates in relevant geoscience communities, including ESDS working groups, ESIP, AGU, and EarthCube.
* [Microbiological Quality and Food Safety of Plants Grown on ISS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/r8xg-fbm2) - <p>A challenge for growing fresh foods (vegetables) in space is demonstrating that they are safe for consumption according to NASA microbiological standards set for food. The goal of this project is to select and advance methods to enable real-time sampling, microbiological analysis, and sanitation of crops grown on the &nbsp;International Space Station (ISS). These methods would validate the microbiological quality of crops grown for consumption to ensure safe and palatable fresh foods. This will be achieved through the development / advancement of microbiological sample collection, rapid pathogen detection, and effective sanitation methods that are compatible with a microgravity environment.</p> <p>This project aligns with current plans for deployment of a vegetable production unit on the International Space Station (Veggie) and the procurement and evaluation of platforms (RAZOR) at Kennedy Space Center for rapid microbial monitoring on ISS.</p><p>A 3-step approach is being used to evaluate and modify methods for analyzing fresh produce (fresh vegetables / fruits) that would be compatible with a microgravity environment. Candidate food crops are being grown in a controlled environment chamber for the following tests:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Assessment of sampling procedures for surfaces of edible plant material to gather meaningful microbiological data. The three sample methods are surface swabbing, the use of adhesive tape to collect surface microbes and a blender method to remove microbes from plant tissue. The blender method is the conventional method for food sample processing. The other two methods have been tested as portable real-time methods to collect samples from the surfaces of meat as well as produce including tomato fruit and leafy greens</li><li>Analysis of samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), arabidopsis thaliana peroxidases (ATP) analysis, and culture based methods for enumeration as well as identification of target organisms with an emphasis on approaches that yield rapid results. The methods employed are all commercially available technologies. Our goal is to reduce detection time with the constraints of methodology that could practically be used on the ISS for sample analysis.</li><li>Comparison of sanitizing and disinfection procedures for the vegetables and plant growth unit surfaces, including methods developed and tested in the AES Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU). The focus is on the development of a sanitizing wipe that can be used on plant growth systems such as Veggie as well as edible plant surfaces to reduce the microbial load. The sanitizer being used is a citric acid based food grade sanitizer (Pro-San<sup>&reg;</sup>). This sanitizer has been tested previously and has been shown to be effective in the sanitization of edible vegetables.</li></ol><p><strong>Progress</strong></p><p>A series of experiments has been completed using three different sampling procedures, swabbing, adhesive tape collection and sample blending for the recovery of bacteria from the surface of radish, tomato and lettuce. Data collected and analyzed to date show no significant difference using culture based detection methods between the adhesive tape and bag blender sample methods in the recovery of <em>Salmonella enterica</em> Typhimurium, a human associated food borne pathogen inoculated onto the surface of lettuce, tomato, and radish. The swab method recovery was significantly lower then the other two methods in the case of lettuce and radish. With the samples collected by these different sampling procedures we are comparing detection and quantification methods, specifically real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) using two platforms, the LightCycler&reg; (Roche Diagnostics) and a rapid portable system, the RAZOR (Biofire, Salt Lake City, UT) with conventional culture based methods. For these tests we used <em>S. enterica </em>Typhimurium and <em>Eshcerichia coli</em> K12 inoculated onto the surface
* [The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Genomes (SETG)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tngt-vgkw) - <p>Background: Widespread synthesis of complex organics, including nucleobases and ribose precursors, occurred early in the history of the solar system in the solar nebula. These organics, delivered by comets and meteorites to multiple potentially habitable zones (Earth, Mars, Enceladus, Europa, Titan) may have biased the evolution of life towards utilization of similar informational polymers. Meteoritic exchange might also have produced shared ancestry, most plausible for Earth and Mars. We propose to continue development of the ASTID-funded Search for Extra-Terrestrial Genomes (SETG), a life detection instrument for in-situ sequencing of nucleic acids. Science Goals: Our mission focus area is astrobiology and the search for life beyond Earth. Our science goal for Mars is to search for related or unrelated nucleic acid-based life, particularly life that has the potential to interact with life on Earth; this may also inform sample selection for Mars Sample Return (MSR) and reduce the risks of false positives through the first in-situ measurement of forward contamination. Our science goal for Enceladus is to search for a second genesis based on nucleic acids in the plumes emanating from the South Polar Region. Life detection may also be possible in Europa orbit but the availability of a suitable plume is tenuous and it is a challenge for biological reagents to survive intense radiation there. Objectives: The objectives of this proposal are to 1) advance SETG component/subsystem development through validation in lab and relevant environments, 2) integrate instrument components into a single automated end-to-end system, and 3) assess and validate instrument performance and limits of detection (expected to be ppb or better) using synthetic and environmental samples, including operation under Mars temperature and pressure. Methodology: We will apply advances in nucleic acid extraction and concentration to enable high-yield isolation of high-purity nucleic acids, followed by nanopore-based detection and single-molecule sequencing-by-synthesis. This effort will include stabilization of all reagents. B. subtilis spores will be used to validate detection limits down to 50 spores, with testing to 10 spores. To further assess system performance, we will use other synthetic and environmental samples, carry out bench top and field validation, and operation under Mars-like temperature and pressure conditions; this will advance SETG from TRL 3 to TRL 6 in preparation for future flight definition. Relevance: SETG addresses the NASA Science Plan question &#39;How did life begin and evolve on Earth and has it evolved elsewhere in the solar system?&#39; and the corresponding objective to &#39;Identify and investigate past or present habitable environments on Mars and other worlds, and determine if there is or has ever been life elsewhere in the solar system.&#39; Our effort is responsive to Decadal Survey priorities, including Mars Sample Return, Europa Orbiter, and the moderate-priority Enceladus orbiter. Why MATISSE? First, SETG requires substantial additional development and validation before flight definition, and addresses the specified TRL range. Second, our effort will help to provide heritage for a new class of instruments that utilize biological components to enable a range of new capabilities at extremely low power, mass, and volume. Third, we cannot envision a discovery that would be higher payoff than the indisputable identification of life beyond Earth, which SETG is uniquely positioned to do. Finally, SETG also has significant Earth applications ranging from environmental monitoring to clinical diagnosis.</p>
* [Cloud-Based Social Media Visual Analytics Disaster Response System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pnda-zj57) - We propose a next-generation cloud-based social media visual analytics disaster response system that will enable decision-makers and first-responders to obtain real-time analytics (both descriptive and predictive) for situational awareness and early-warning. Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook provide rapid "sensory" feedback from "human sensors" &#150; the millions of people on the ground including those affected by the disaster as well as hundreds of first-responders and relief organizations. The problem is that this social media data can be overwhelming and noisy (lots of irrelevant stuff). Our proposed innovation is to combine and analyze this social media unstructured "big-data", together with other structured data from a variety of sources including NASA. The emphasis is on visual analytics which will allow all these diverse geospatial data to be integrated and analyzed on a real-time basis in an intuitive manner. We utilize geobrowsers such as COAST, Google Earth, and OpenStreetMap for display of the output of the visual analytics prediction system. This is an interactive system which enables the relevant users and decision-makers to provide input to the analytics process as the solution evolves.

* [Individualized Stress Detection System, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/88e7-gfya) - Given the extended duration of future missions and the isolated, extreme, and confined environments, there is the possibility that stress-related behavioral conditions and mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) will develop. The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an integrated system that will track physiological signals (heart rate and heart rate variability) and behavioral signals (sleep wake patterns) to detect chronic stress, hyperarousal, and insomnia during space missions. This project will deliver both the sensor hardware and signal processing software needed for the real-time data collection and integration with other behavioral health monitoring systems (e.g., Individualized Fatigue Meter and Individualized Behavioral Health Meter). The result of Phase II will be a system that can be deployed in space analog environments for validation testing and ultimately deployed on ISS to assist astronauts and mission support personnel in the detection of astronaut chronic stress, hyperarousal, and insomnia. The critical need for an Individualized Stress Detection System has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP IRP Gap BMED2. The Technology Readiness Level at the end of Phase II will be TRL 5.
* [The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development.](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rp24-jkbu) - Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development and has been proposed as a gravisensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days. Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins chemokines IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules. Importantly 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity. Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs. Total RNA samples extracted from Pthrp+/+and -/- trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) exposed for 6 days to simulated 0g in Synthecon rotating cell or left 6 days in culture at 1g. Cells had either been treated with a pulsatile treatment (2 h/day) of PTHrP1-36 peptide (10-8M) or received a change in growth medium. In total: 8 different conditions with 2 replicates each i.e. Pthrp+/+ TOs at 0g or 1g with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment and Pthrp-/- TOs at 0g or 1 g,with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment.
* [Online Detection, Isolation, and Remediation of Flight Software Faults, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kre6-ry4f) - Increasingly, critical flight functionality is implemented in software, but traditional (integrated) vehicle health management (IVHM) has primarily addressed hardware faults. All fielded software has residual errors, and the marginal costs to remove errors grow as the target residual error rate decreases. Our innovation is the development of tools, architectural concepts and software development methodologies to extend IVHM systems to detect, isolate and recover from software errors, as a cost effective way to increase the reliability and robustness of flight software. Software fault detection, isolation and recovery (SFDIR) fixes or contains the impact of faults and reduces the possibility of catastrophic loss. Each phase ? detection, isolation, and recovery ? raises new research challenges. This work addresses automated diagnostics of mission-critical avionics and middleware or software toolkits to lower the cost of developing online health monitoring applications. Our technical objectives are to detect, by code instrumentation, when the software state violates explicated safety constraints; using model-based reasoning and program analysis techniques, to trace from symptom to error source; and to recover from errors in a safe way preserving or replacing as much functionality as possible, and in all cases "to do no harm". This technology may also be applied to monitor potential security threats.
* [Global Gridded Geographically Based Economic Data (G-Econ), Version 4](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y7sx-uaxy) - The Global Gridded Geographically Based Economic Data (G-Econ), Version 4 contains derived one degree grid cells of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data in GRID and ASCII formats for both Market Exchange Rate (MER) and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) for the years 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. MER is the exchange rate between local and U.S. dollar currencies for a given time period established by the market. PPP is the exchange rate between a country's currency and U.S. dollars adjusted to reflect the actual cost in U.S. dollars of purchasing a standardized market basket of goods in that country using the country's currency. The original data from the G-Econ Project at Yale University is also available in tabular format and includes latitude and longitude geographic coordinates of the grid cells, area of grid cells, as well as country names, distance to coast, elevation, vegetation, population, precipitation and temperature.
* [A Synthetic Biology Architecture to Detoxify and Enrich Mars Soil for Agriculture](https://data.nasa.gov/d/itf7-xpxy) - Although the theoretical case for space biological engineering is convincing, since recent studies on the use of biology in space showed substantial payload minimization over abiotic approaches even before any engineering, the functioning of these biological technologies has yet to be proven in a space-like environment. We will study such functioning for a synthetic biology architecture that can detoxify the perchlorate in Mars soil and also enrich it with ammonia. Our work will inform a prime deliverable of a comparative assessment with alternate chemical approaches postulated or scoped by NASA, and will clarify the feasibility of utilizing our proposed biotechnology to support manned Mars missions. The two system processes of perchlorate reduction and nitrogen fixation individually exist in biology and, when combined, will potentiate soil-based agriculture (by plants or microbes) on Mars. Our concept architecture is a single model organism that will eventually have both systems that are now separate in different strains of the same species. The advantages of our proposed architecture over current approaches, such as washing out perchlorate to cleanse soil or using hydroponics to grow plants, include a low initialization mass of microbial cells, on- demand cell growth with in situ resources, and the elimination of toxic wastewater. To accomplish our proposed concept architecture, we will investigate two strains of a diverse clade of organisms, Pseudomonas, which includes relevant extremophiles. Pseudomonas stutzeri PDA is a perchlorate reducer that we have previously studied using a method that examines the fitness profiles of organism mutants in several environment conditions to obtain genetic determinants of fitness. Pseudomonas stutzeri is also capable of nitrogen fixation (e.g. strain A1501). Pseudomonas has two advantages that make experiments with it more practical than with other space synthetic biology possibilities like photosynthetic, extremophile cyanobacteria: the use of the same host cloning vectors as the model laboratory organism Escherichia coli, and a doubling time of an hour, which is much faster than seven hours for a model non-extremophile cyanobacterium and four days for a model extremophile cyanobacterium. We will test an environmentally-relevant Pseudomonas host that, in follow-on work, we expect to refactor for efficient expression, operation, and interfacing to different hosts including Pseudomonad extremophiles, cyanobacteria, and other mission possibilities. Here, we will map perchlorate reduction and nitrogen fixation performance to host physiology and environment variables. Since we have already developed a microbial growth chamber that can apply environment parameters over Mars-relevant ranges, e.g., pressure from 10 kPa, temperature from -60 degrees C to 40 degrees C, light intensities up to 25 klx, UV radiation, and a 95%-3% carbon dioxide-nitrogen atmosphere, we will study how strains PDA and A1501 perform in increasingly Mars-like conditions, and what genetic mechanisms mediate survival, growth and activities in these conditions. By controllably exploring functionality, we will map the most extreme conditions in which our mesophile can survive, grow and perform. We will then identify limitations on these activities, and derive targets for future individual and joint optimization of system operation in parameter ranges that are more like Mars. Our work will enable a techno-economic analysis of performance versus output-generation time, input/nutrient mass needs, necessity of alternate chemical approaches, etc. Our concept will achieve the “promising potential” of biological technologies, identified in the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap TA 7 as “deserve[ing] sine attention.” Broader impacts include Earth-based bioremediation (e.g., land cleanup near oil wells and toxic spills) and non-arable land enrichment to improve food production to address famines, drought, larger populations, etc.
* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jc5t-749b) - The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. FASIR-NDVI data are also used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface. There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.
* [Towards Efficient Viscous Modeling Based on Cartesian Methods for Automated Flow Simulation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kjxx-ai8x) - The proposed work aims at developing techniques that will address the
current limitations of Cartesian-based Navier-Stokes CFD schemes by
exploring three promising methods of implementing improved wall boundary
conditions. The three methods are based on: (1) the diamond stencil
approach of Delanaye et al., (2) the extrapolation boundary condition
work by Marshall and Ruffin, and (3) the Material Point Method developed
by Advanced Dynamics. The knowledge gained from prototype
implementations of these schemes will lead to the development of an
efficient viscous modeling algorithm suitable to general Cartesian CFD
codes at the end of Phase I. Phase II will integrate this algorithm into
a large-scale Cartesian CFD code in consultation with NASA technical
representative. Phase III will commercialize the resulting techniques to
be developed in Phases I and II and demonstrate their applicability to a
wide range of problems.
* [Standardized 'Pre-flight' Exercise Tests to Predict Performance during Extravehicular Activities in a Lunar Environment Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kvaq-63x8) - &lt;p&gt;Several manuscripts have been submitted or are in final preparation for submission from the Phase I data. Phase II has been completed, with a total of 12 subjects finishing the protocol. Each subject attempted to complete 9 laps of our obstacle course at two different paces; one representing the average pace of the Apollo astronauts during lunar EVAs (VO2 of ~20 ml/kg/min) and one at an estimated suited Martian cost of 30 ml/kg/min. All subjects were able to complete the course at the Lunar pace. However, at the Martian pace, 5 of the 12 subjects failed ~ lap 5. Subjects who completed the Martian pace had a VO2max on average of 44.3 &amp;plusmn; 5.0 ml/kg/min, while the 5 who failed (3 men, 2 women) had a VO2max of 36.8 &amp;plusmn; 2.9 ml/kg/min. Further, the Martian pace was likely at or above the critical speed of the subjects who failed. EMG and Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) signals differed by pace, but were not different between those who successfully completed both paces and those who failed at the Martian pace. Initial analysis of EMG and NIRS data failed to find any differences in the responses between those that failed and those that successfully completed the 9 laps. These results are being written up for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the hoist suspension system is operational to the point of being able to conduct pilot experiments. We have acquired preliminary VO2 responses during ambulation at 3 mph under 1-g, Martian (3/8-g), and Lunar (1/6-g) offloading. In addition, during the Lunar offloading, subjects naturally and unconsciously assumed an almost skipping stride pattern, very similar to that adopted by the Apollo astronauts during lunar EVAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
* [NONA Repair of Composite Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ib7j-quvs) - While much attention is necessarily focused on the evaluation and certification of the materials and processes involved in adhesive bonding, development is still needed in decreasing the cost, time, and complexity of the current repair concepts. A material and processing system is needed that allows the design, infusion, and cure of composite repairs without the current roadblocks imposed by ovens, autoclaves, and expensive tooling. VARTM processing of custom repairs allows freedom in design and minimizes the specialized tooling required for patches and straps that are prefabricated apart from the structures needing repair. CRG's no-oven, no-autoclave (NONA) composite processing technology enables the fabrication of high-performance composite parts without the limitations imposed by autoclaves and ovens. NASA originally funded CRG to develop the materials and processes for the manufacture of large, single-piece space launch structures. Building on that activity, CRG proposes NONA repair of composite structures. In this concept, NONA resin is introduced to a scarfed surface and dry fiber via VARTM processing and undergoes complete cure without additional heat input. NONA offers the opportunity to repair PMC structures on-site without the use of large capital equipment. The University of Dayton Research Institute will conduct the scarfing and evaluation of test materials. The resin consists of common aerospace epoxy components, but it is formulated to achieve complete cure in a matter of hours without additional heat input. The two-part epoxy system uses its own chemical energy to propel itself through a complete cure. It provides good strength, chemical resistance, and thermal performance up to 350 deg. F. CRG envisions a mobile fleet of NONA composite technicians that can perform repair activities at manufacturing sites around the world, restoring functionality to damaged structures and tools, minimizing impact on plant operations and production.
* [Global Annual Average PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i7t3-dqnp) - Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data sets represent a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data. Together the grids provide a continuous surface of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. The satellite AOD retrievals were converted to ground-level concentrations based on a conversion factor developed by researchers at Dalhousie University that accounts for spatial and temporal variations in aerosol properties and vertical structure as derived from a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 30 arc-minutes (0.5 degree or approximately 50 sq. km at the equator) and cover the world from 70°N to 60°S latitude. The grids were produced by researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute in collaboration with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network/Columbia University under a NASA-ROSES project entitled "Using Satellite Data to Develop Environmental Indicators: An Application of NASA Data Products to Support High Level Decisions for National and International Environmental Protection". Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature death as well as increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease, especially in the elderly, young children, and those already suffering from these illnesses. The World Health Organization guideline for PM2.5 average annual exposure is less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms per cubic meter, whereas the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) primary standard is less than or equal to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA primary standards are designed to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.
* [Physical Modeling for Anomaly Diagnostics and Prognostics, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/db8i-z2d6) - Ridgetop developed an innovative, model-driven anomaly diagnostic and fault characterization system for electromechanical actuator (EMA) systems to mitigate catastrophic failures. Ridgetop developed a MIL-STD-1553 bus monitor and a MIL-STD-1553 bus controller that simulates the aircraft data bus, reads the environmental (i.e., altitude) and operational (i.e., response of system) data of a system and determines if a fault is manifesting; and if true determines the root cause and symptoms of the fault. Once an anomaly is detected, the Model-based Avionic Prognostic Reasoner (MAPR) solves a user-outlined state-space model, symbolically, using a Gauss-Newton optimization method and the information from the MIL-STD-1553 bus. This algorithm outputs a list of best fitting parameters to match the command to the actual performance. Rules are programmed in, based on results from principal component analysis . The rules determine both fault mode and the severity of that fault. The rules can distinguish between two failure modes: Mechanical jam and MOSFET failure, and healthy.
The real-time processing will allow for critical evolutions in flight safety and provides a game-changing approach to condition-based maintenance. Once deployed, flight safety can be improved by allowing the on-board flight computers to read from the MAPR and update their control envelope based on its evaluations, reducing damage propagation and increasing operational safety. In Phase 2, we will develop a functioning ground-based prototype of the technology to show the efficacy of the method. A ground-based version of the tool is the best candidate for development to ease adoption by testing in a low-risk environment; this tool will be demonstrated at the end of Phase 2. The MAPR concept is also applicable to any system with a state-space representation but at this point it has been developed with EMAs in mind. The MAPR prototype is at TRL 5 and will reach a TRL 7 by the end of Phase 2.
* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Biodiversity](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9mfy-wzq5) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Biodiversity provides data and information on amphibians, disease agents (extent and distribution of infectious and parasitic diseases), drylands (cattle, sheep and goats, and pasture), islands (fishing pressure, sewage pollution index and tourism), loss of natural land cover (biomes and realms), polar population, species distribution models, and terrestrial ecoregions and realms. Biodiversity is defined as the variability among living organisms from all sources, including terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are a part. The original information was received from multiple sources that include the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, formerly the World Conservation Union), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) of Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on-board NASA satellites Terra and Aqua. Through the Convention on Biological Diversity, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, and the Convention on Migratory Species, the data were also designed to meet the needs of stakeholders in the business, civil and native communities.
* [Decadal Variations in NDVI and Food Production in India](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hbap-xs3e) - In this study we use long-term satellite, climate, and crop observations to document the spatial distribution of the recent stagnation in food grain production affecting the water-limited tropics (WLT), a region where 1.5 billion people live and depend on local agriculture that is constrained by chronic water shortages. Overall, our analysis shows that the recent stagnation in food production is corroborated by satellite data. The growth rate in annually integrated vegetation greenness, a measure of crop growth, has declined significantly (p < 0.10) in 23% of the WLT cropland area during the last decade, while statistically significant increases in the growth rates account for less than 2%. In most countries, the decade-long declines appear to be primarily due to unsustainable crop management practices rather than climate alone. One quarter of the statistically significant declines are observed in India, which with the world’s largest population of food-insecure people and largest WLT croplands, is a leading example of the observed declines. Here we show geographically matching patterns of enhanced crop production and irrigation expansion with groundwater that have leveled off in the past decade. We estimate that, in the absence of irrigation, the enhancement in dry-season food grain production in India, during 1982–2002, would have required an increase in annual rainfall of at least 30% over almost half of the cropland area. This suggests that the past expansion of use of irrigation has not been sustainable. We expect that improved surface and groundwater management practices will be required to reverse the recent food grain production declines. **MDPI and ACS Style** Milesi, C.; Samanta, A.; Hashimoto, H.; Kumar, K.K.; Ganguly, S.; Thenkabail, P.S.; Srivastava, A.N.; Nemani, R.R.; Myneni, R.B.

The grids have a resolution of 30 arc-seconds (0.0083 decimal degrees), or approximately 1 square km. The gridded variables are based on census block geography from Census 2000 TIGER/Line Files and census variables (income, poverty, education, housing age). This dataset is produced by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).
* [Predictive Condition-Based Maintenance for Vertical Lift Vehicles, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bw7t-fjgd) - NASA has invested significant effort in the past decade in developing and maturing technologies that enable efficient and effective use of Next-generation (NextGen) Vertical Lift (VL) systems for a broad class of missions and operations. One of the key barriers it faces to the widespread use of VL vehicles within the National Airspace is the cost of maintenance on the vehicles to keep them safe and reliable. Qualtech Systems, Inc (QSI) in collaboration with Lockheed Martin - Mission Systems and Training (LM-MST) seeks to address these maintenance challenges by fielding a predictive Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) solution leveraging a diagnostic reasoner TEAMS-RDS (Testability Engineering And Maintenance System Remote Diagnosis Server) and prognostic algorithms. CBM+ involves inferring, tracking and forecasting of system degradation based on state awareness acquired from monitored data through fault detection, isolation, identification, diagnosis and prognosis techniques and to proactively plan maintenance actions to improve system availability and safety. QSI-LM's CBM+ solution will furnish the ability to keep the vehicle health status continually ahead of an advancing failure accumulation through a predictive maintenance strategy geared towards replacement-while-in-operation before the ensuing failures render the VL vehicle inoperable. Diagnosis will focus on current health state identification through detection, isolation, root cause analysis and identification of faults that have already occurred, while prognosis will leverage the current health state identification and forecast performance degradation, incipient component failures and probability density (or moments) of remaining useful life (RUL) or Time to Maintenance (TTM) or Time to Failure (TTF). It is anticipated that the CBM+ solution will leverage the currently existing communication capabilities between the aircraft, the pilot and ground-support personnel in a seamless and automated manner.
* [Data Reduction Techniques for Real-time Fault Detection and Diagnosis, and Multiple Fault Inference with Imperfect Tests, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4dv5-yaky) - The recent advances in data collection and storage capabilities have led to information overload in many applications, including on-line monitoring of spacecraft operations with time series data. Such datasets present new challenges in data analysis, especially for implementation in memory-constrained DECUs. Also, the traditional statistical methods break down partly because of the increase in the number of observations (measurements), but mostly due to an increase in the number of variables associated with each observation ("dimension of the data"). One of the problems with high-dimensional datasets is that not all the measured variables are "important" for understanding the underlying phenomena of interest. In addition to the computational cost, irrelevant features may also cause a reduction in the accuracy of some algorithms. The first key issue we propose to address is that of data reduction techniques for onboard implementation of data-driven classification techniques in memory-constrained onboard processing units. Some of the classification techniques we intend to use with the above data-reduction techniques include, support vector machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), principal component Bayesian analysis (PCA). To improve the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of the above classifiers, we will apply classifier fusion techniques such as AdaBoost, Error correcting output codes, Voting to find which architecture will enhance the accuracy and under what conditions. Finally we will investigate Dynamic Multiple Fault Diagnosis that can work with imperfect fault/anomaly detection tests. As part of this task, we will develop novel factorial hidden Markov model-based inferencing techniques such as Lagrangian relaxation and Viterbi decoding algorithms to solve this difficult combinatorial optimization problem, for on-board vehicle health monitoring and fault diagnosis.
* [Laser transmitter for space-based water vapor lidar](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kdvm-vmpf) - Water vapor (WV) lies at the heart of most key atmospheric processes. Humidity is essential for the development of severe weather, it influences, directly and indirectly through cloud formation, the planetary radiative balance, and it influences atmospheric dynamics, surface fluxes and soil moisture. Despite its central importance, research to date has not led to a universally accepted picture of the factors controlling WV amount, a solid understanding of the mechanisms by which it influences atmospheric processes, or even precise knowledge of its concentrations in many parts of the atmosphere. A future satellite-based WV Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) would revolutionize weather and climate research by providing high-resolution and accurate WV profiles with global coverage. Passive microwave and IR measurements are the backbone of weather and climate research but have significant limitations. Passive measurements are weighted toward the upper troposphere and hence have very little sensitivity near the surface where the majority of WV and its largest spatial and temporal gradients reside. Passive sounders also suffer from coarse vertical resolution and unknown biases resulting from aerosol and cloud contamination. The DIAL approach is self-calibrating, and its measurement uncertainties can be precisely quantified and traded by adapting the spatial resolution to the defined scientific objective. Furthermore, the DIAL approach can overcome one of the largest shortcomings of current passive measurements by adjusting the measurement sensitivity to near-surface atmosphere to capture the moisture variability above and through the boundary layer, in the presence of intervening cloud and aerosol layers in order to improve our understanding of fundamental mechanisms driving convection and cloud microphysics. Conventional WV DIAL lasers are inadequate for space-based operation as they are inefficient, complex, and have low average power, which limits precision and spatial resolution. We propose to build a WV DIAL laser transmitter to enable WV DIAL measurements throughout the troposphere from a space-based platform. The transmitter will probe an atmospheric WV absorption line near 816 nm, allowing for profile measurements of WV number density using the DIAL technique, and aerosol and cloud profiles using the backscatter lidar approach. As part of this effort, we will advance the TRL of the laser transmitter to lower the development time, risk, and cost of a future WV DIAL satellite instrument.
The proposed laser will utilize thulium-based solid-state laser crystals, which offer the prospect of greatly improved efficiency, simplicity, and average-power scalability compared to conventional methods. Recent proof-of-principle demonstrations of Tm:LiYF4 (YLF) lasers highlight the promise of the proposed approach, provide laser physics understanding, and set a clear development path. The objective of this proposal is to develop Tm:YLF lasers with the energy per pulse (≥100 mJ), average power (≥10 W, 50 Hz double pulsed), efficiency (≥5%), and spectral control (≥ 99.9% spectral purity) needed for a space-based WV DIAL. The period of performance for the proposed effort is 3 years. Years 1 and 2 will focus on risk reduction where critical performance metrics will be demonstrated on a bench top breadboard. In year 3 we will design and build a brassboard laser compatible with the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) WV DIAL, High Altitude Lidar Observatory (HALO). We exit the program with a brassboard laser that has the performance of a space-based WV DIAL system and will be validated using HALO in a follow-on effort from high-altitude aircraft as a stepping stone to space. This technology has entry TRL-2 and a planned TRL-4 exit with a clear path to TRL-5 in a follow-on program by incorporation of the brassboard laser into HALO.
* [Global Landslide Catalog Export](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rthp-tcrg) - The Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was developed with the goal of identifying rainfall-triggered landslide events around the world, regardless of size, impacts or location. The GLC considers all types of mass movements triggered by rainfall, which have been reported in the media, disaster databases, scientific reports, or other sources. The GLC has been compiled since 2007 at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This is a unique data set with the ID tag “GLC” in the landslide editor. This dataset on data.nasa.gov was a one-time export from the Global Landslide Catalog maintained separately. It is current as of March 7, 2016. The original catalog is available here: http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmaps.nccs.nasa.gov%2Fserver%2Frest%2Fservices%2Fglobal_landslide_catalog%2Fglc_viewer_service%2FFeatureServer&source=sd.

* [Ground-Based Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Weekly Station Position Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5mec-2bdz) - Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Data (multi-day files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis to compute weekly station position solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. The IDS Analysis Center Coordinator combines these individual AC solutions in a standard least-squares adjustment to generate the official IDS weekly combined station position solution. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/DORIS/DORIS_product_holdings.html.
