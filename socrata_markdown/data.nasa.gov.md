These are, so far, the highest spatial resolution thermal data ever obtained for Mars. Four slightly overlapping thermal panoramas (also called scans or swaths) cover a large portion of the equatorial region from 30S to 6N latitude. Simultaneous visible panoramas were taken during each of the four observing sessions; due to spacecraft memory limitations, visible channel processing was stopped early relative to the thermal channel for 2 of the sessions (2 and 4). Thus, the visible channel panoramas are shorter than the thermal panoramas for these sessions. These data are saved for historical reasons; they are not considered to be of archival quality.* [LBA-ECO LC-03 SAR Images, Land Cover, and Biomass, Four Areas across Brazilian Amazon](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g6iu-2mfe) - This data set provides three related land cover products for four study areas across the Brazilian Amazon: Manaus, Amazonas; Tapajos National Forest, Para Western (Santarem); Rio Branco, Acre; and Rondonia, Rondonia.

For that reason, extreme caution is advised when considering the use of these data.Any use of the derived data is not recommended because the results have not been validated. However, the DEM and vectors (related data set), and orthorectified SAR data can be used if the user understands how these were produced and accepts the limitations.* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vuh9-8uvt) - The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. FASIR-NDVI data are also used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface. There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.* [Global Soil Texture and Derived Water-Holding Capacities (Webb et al.)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jshw-bg9i) - A standardized global data set of soil horizon thicknesses and textures (particle size distributions).* [Continuous Electrode Inertial Electrostatic Confinement Fusion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4gjy-qz4d) - NASA recognizes within its roadmaps (specifically TA 3.1.6) that development of aneutronic fusion (such as p-11B) reactors with direct energy conversion (>80%) would be an enabling technology to achieve low specific mass (kg/kW) through the elimination of shielding and potentially the need for dedicated radiators. In addition, material activation due to neutron capture could be avoided. The challenge is of course to develop a plasma confinement system that is far less massive than the current leading (magnetic/inertial) approaches, but consumes less power than is generated by the fusion process – a feat that has yet to be achieved even terrestrially. Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) techniques offer the possible advantage of considerably lower mass, however they suffer from limitations that have hampered their development, just as plasma instabilities have hampered the development of magnetic systems. The difference is that considerable time, effort and funding have gone into the engineering of solutions to the plasma instability problem, whereas the limitations of IEC have always been viewed as “too fundamental”. The objectives of the proposed research are therefore two-fold: 1) To retire the broad fundamental criticisms of IEC devices by demonstrating feasible engineering solutions, and 2) To develop a comprehensive system-level performance model to support parametric scaling.

The impact of successfully achieving the target specific mass of 2 kg/kW can be seen in the context of the previously proposed JIMO spacecraft. The full dry mass was about 24 metric tons, with 12 metric tons of Xe propellant. The fission reactor module mass was estimated at just over 6 tons, not including roughly 2 tons of radiator mass. At a power output of 200 kWe, the specific mass of the full power system (reactor+radiators) would have been about 40 kg/kW. At a target specific mass of ~2kg/kW, the same power system would have a mass of only 400 kg, saving 7.5 tons of dry mass and 3.5 tons of propellant. This is just over 30% reduction in total mass to orbit, at a savings of $220M. It is also worth noting that the fuel mass (assuming p-11B @ = 80%) for the entire 20 year mission design life, if operating continuously at 200 kWe, would amount to ~2.3 kg.

Phase I of the research will be primarily dedicated to the development of the performance model to help motivate the efficacy of the approach in advance of Phase II. However, some effort in Phase I will address the key criticism of IEC devices, namely that of thermalization, through numerical simulation. In Phase II, more detailed modeling and numerical simulation of electron confinement within the device core, energy loss paths, and direct energy conversion of the fusion products will be done. The results of the Phase II effort would then be incorporated into a technology development plan.* [Familiarization and Detection of Green Monopropellants](https://data.nasa.gov/d/49sb-nd4s) - <p>Ammonium dinitramide (ADN) and hydroxyl ammonium nitrate (HAN) are &quot;green&rdquo; monopropellants which will be appearing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for processing in the next few years. These are relatively safe replacements for hydrazine as a monopropellant; however, little is known about methods of leak detection, vapor scrubbing, air emissions, or cleanup that will be required for safe and environmentally benign operations at KSC.&nbsp;</p> <p>ADN was developed by the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), while HAN was developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory to be a propellant. Alliant Techsystems Inc (ATK) is predominantly evaluating ADN for future use, while Ball Aerospace was awarded a NASA Technology Demonstration Mission (TDM) to use HAN as a monopropellant to be launched from KSC/Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Kennedy Space Center needs the technology in place prior to their arrival and needs to make recommendations as to their adoption if significant issues are found.</p><p>This is novel work that is necessary to safely support the evaluation and development of the next generation of &ldquo;green&rdquo; propellants.&nbsp;The goal of this project is to develop leak detection and related technologies for the two new &rdquo;green&rdquo; monopropellants. This project is in its&nbsp;early stage of development; information regarding this project will be updated in the near future.</p>* [Mass Production of Mature Lunar Regolith Simulant, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9qam-dky5) - As NASA prepares for future exploration activities on the Moon, there is a growing need to develop higher fidelity lunar soil simulants that can accurately reproduce the properties and behavior of lunar soil. Simulants are employed on earth to verify the performance of equipment, mechanisms, structures and processes to be used on the lunar surface.  One of the significant limitations of current simulants is the lack of constituents, such as agglutinates and spherules, which often contain nano-phase iron (Fe0).  These constituents are needed in any high fidelity simulant.  Recently, Plasma Processes, Inc. (PPI) has developed a process to create simulated agglutinates and volcanic glasses from JSC-1A lunar regolith simulant.  Microstructural characterization has shown that these components contain an appreciable amount of nano phase Fe0.  However, current production of these simulant additives is limited.  The ultimate objective of this Phase I effort is to develop an economical, large scale manufacturing process to produce simulant agglutinates and volcanic glasses.  This production process promises to be a viable route for significantly enhancing the fidelity of existing and future lunar regolith simulants.* [System for Acquisition and Analysis of Energy-Based Acoustic Data for Rocket Noise, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hjsy-izeb) - Accurate estimates of the vibroacoustic loading placed on space vehicles and payloads during launch require knowledge of the rocket noise source properties.  Given the extreme nature of acoustic environments near the plume, data sufficient to characterize the noise source region have been difficult to acquire.  Without these data, structures may be designed to handle an insufficient or excessive vibroacoustic loads, resulting in either an overbuilt structure (and extra weight), or an under-designed vibration isolation system that could result in damaged cargos.
Current energy base acoustic probe designs have limited frequency bandwidth due to physical limitations.  A new set of probe designs is proposed that incorporate both a new physical probe design but also a more advanced signal processing methodology that will significantly increase the usable frequency bandwidth of the probes while reducing the manufacturing and maintenance costs of the probes.
The probe system will also include the design of a complete data acquisition system capable of recording data under the harsh conditions present in typical rocket motor test firings.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rbdg-nyf3) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [Chromatid Painting for Chromosomal Inversion Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ubcw-du7d) - We propose a novel approach to the detection of chromosomal inversions.  Transmissible chromosome aberrations (translocations and inversions) have profound genetic effects, such as disrupting regulatory sequences that control gene expression, or creating genetic chimeras.  These chromosome aberrations play a causative role in cancer, and they are induced by radiation.  As such, chromosome aberrations are relevant to three NASA needs, biodosimetry, analysis of astronaut lymphocytes for cumulative radiation damage, and space radiation risk modeling.  Of all structural chromosomal anomalies, inversions -- a reversal of orientation of material within a chromosome -- are the most difficult to detect.  This is especially true of small inversions, most of which are invisible to all current cytogenetic techniques.  Yet small inversions are likely the most transmissible (nonlethal) form of chromosomal damage, so they persist, a feature which lends credence to their use in retrospective biodosimetry.  This Phase 1 project is intended to provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of a new method of molecular cytogenetics that will permit highly sensitive inversion detection.  The project will help us to perfect our bioinformatics strategy for probe design, optimize probe labeling reactions, refine hybridization conditions, and establish a procedure for cost analysis.  In Phase 2, we will scale-up probe production to make whole chromosome analysis possible.  This next step, although conceptually simple, relies entirely on the processes devised and tested in Phase 1.  Moreover efficient, cost-effective probe-making will be essential to commercialization (Phase 3).  The technology readiness level at the end of the Phase 1 contract is expected to be 4-5, i.e. validated in laboratory and relevant environments.* [Multifunctional Shielding and Self-Healing HybridSil Smart Composites for Space, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/grz3-i34g) - NanoSonic has recently developed multifunctional shielding and self-healing HybridSil&#63720; (HS) smart composites via the inclusion of innovative nanoshell inclusions.  These lightweight yet high-strength rapidly self-healing materials combined with NanoSonic's Metal Rubber&#153; (MR) shielding nano-additives and are offered herein as protection systems for NASA vehicles, habitat modules, and pressure vessel structures.  The conductive aspect of Metal Rubber also enables damage detection.  This technology may overcome the current bottleneck of damage tolerance for current composites that form nearly undetectable cracks upon impact that impart drastic effects on the structural survivability.  HS-MR self-healing composites offer both self-healing and damage detection, as well as the added functionality of very high levels of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) without the need for additional heavy layers.  MR exhibits EMI SE of greater than -100 dB upon exposure to a blow torch, repeated cold flexing at -50 °C, and irradiation under a 60Co source.  During Phase I, TRL 5 shall be reached upon demonstration of damage tolerant, self-healing structural composites with assistance from our radiation expert STTR partner, CSU, and commercial space partner.  During Phase II, TRL 7 shall be achieved upon demonstrated damage detection and self-healing in a representative flight environment with our defense prime partner.* [Fast Neutron Dosimeter for the Space Environment, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vzxn-euj5) - Model calculations and risk assessment estimates indicate that secondary neutrons, with energies ranging between 0.5 to >150 MeV, make a significant contribution to the total absorbed dose received by space crews during long duration space missions [1-3]. Advanced scintillation materials, which exhibit radiation type and mass dependent emission times, coupled to SSPM detectors, provide the optimum volume to payload performance and the ability to easily discriminate between the fraction of dose, which results from secondary neutrons, and that which results from exposure to energetic charged particles and background gamma-rays.
The Phase-1 effort successfully characterized the critical components of the proposed dosimeter, specifically, the response of the scintillation material to irradiation by gamma-rays, protons, and neutrons, as well as the performance of the SSPM detector.  The Phase-1 modeling studies provide a critical foundation for assessing the anticipated signals in the space radiation environment. The proposed dosimeter would overcome many of the limitations in the current generation of neutron dosimeters, and would provide baseline information on the physics, needed with the information from biological studies, to assess risk in future human-space-exploration missions to the moon and Mars.* [SMEX03 ThetaProbe Soil Moisture Data: Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6uzm-2kqy) - This data set includes soil moisture data measured with Delta-T Devices ThetaProbe ML2 sensors for the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03), conducted during June and July 2003 in northern Alabama and southern Tennessee, USA.

The experiment was conducted from June 2003 through July 2003 at various hydrologic network sites in northern Alabama, at the Little River (LR) watershed in southern Georgia, and at the Little Washita (LW) watershed in south-central Oklahoma. Surface roughness parameters include root mean square (rms) height, correlation length (L), and correlation length function [f(L)]. For each regional study area, surface roughness conditions were photographed using a grid board and the roughness photographs were then digitized in order to derive surface roughness calculations. The total volume for this combined data set is approximately 20 KB. Data are provided in ASCII text files and are available via FTP.

GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure.  Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce GNSS satellite and ground receiver clock values. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS rapid combined satellite and receiver clock products. The rapid combination is a daily solution available approximately 17 hours after the end of the previous UTC day. All satellite and receiver clock solution files utilize the clock RINEX format and span 24 hours from 00:00 to 23:45 UTC.* [Spectral Mass-Gauging of Unsettled Liquid With Acoustic Waves](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xv5u-4iat) - <p>The ability to quickly and accurately gauge the amount of available propellant in a tank is one of the basic requirements of propellant management.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under settled or partially settled conditions, various mass-gauging techniques are under development. However, these techniques require installation of hardware inside the tank which is undesirable.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; In microgravity (unsettled) conditions, both the location and shape of the ullage are <em>a priori </em>unknown. Presently, there are no technological solutions capable of determining the volume of unsettled liquid propellant for arbitrary ullage shapes in a tank<sup>1</sup> to within a few per cent accuracy as required for deep space NASA missions.<sup>2-3</sup></p>

<p>The proposed approach aims to overcome the two major limitations of the present technologies: (1) the need of installation of hardware inside the tank; (2) assumption of particular ullage shape. In addition, the approach is (3) applicable to both conducting (MMH) and non-conducting liquids (LOx, LH2) (in contrast to RFMG approach); (4) based on different physical principles from the existing approaches, therefore enabling the required redundancy in mass-gauging in&nbsp; those cases (settled or partially settled liquids), where alternative approaches are satisfactory.</p>
 <p>Overall Concept: Spectral Mass-gauging (SMG) &ndash; computes propellant volume using the acoustic resonances counting function in the propellant tank; it is based on rigorous results from spectral theory (Weyl&rsquo;s Law), providing a shape-invariant spectral characteristics4. Weyl&rsquo;s law provides a rigorous tool to infer the volume of the liquid in partially filled tanks: (i) for arbitrary shapes of the ullage, (ii) systematically controlling accuracy, limited only by the acoustic dissipation, which is found to be very low in space applications and allows reaching theoretical limit of fractions of percent of the tank volume. While Weyl&rsquo;s law is well-known in mathematical community and has been tested in fundamental research5, it has never been applied to acoustic mass-gauging of liquids in space applications, where it offers big promise due to the large dimensions of the tanks; nature of the fluid (liquid) and character of the boundary conditions (vacuum).</p>* [Spatial Heterodyne Spectrometer for Aviation Hazard Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ubk3-ut3a) - Physical Sciences Inc (PSI) proposes the development of a longwave infrared (LWIR) imaging spatial heterodyne spectrometer (I-SHS) for standoff detection of clear air turbulence (CAT) and wake vortices from an airborne platform.  PSI will team with Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) who has produced significant research on the application of LWIR hyperspectral imaging for detection of these and other air hazards.  The research has produced extensive simulations, however, the predicted spectral radiance signatures are an order of magnitude below the noise floor of state of the art in LWIR hyperspectral imagers.  The proposed LWIR I-SHS will offer this order of magnitude improvement in noise equivalent spectral radiance through a combination of high throughput and minimal noise-inducing sampling errors owing to the stationary interferometer.  A preliminary systems analysis predicts a per-pixel NESR of 1E-9 W/(cm^2 ster cm^-1) at 16 cm^-1 spectral resolution.  

In Phase I, PSI will formalize a system performance model and will produce and characterize a breadboard I-SHS which will be used to demonstrate a molecular imaging measurement as a surrogate for a wake vortex.  With the support of GTRI, PSI will generate requirements and a conceptual design for a TRL 5 system to be developed in Phase II.* [RIDES: Raman Icing Detection System, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rnac-b4qp) - Inflight icing of engines and airframe presents a significant hazard to air transport, especially at lower flight elevations during take-off or on approach.  Ice accretions on the wings affect the smooth flow required for proper lift. A thin layer of coarse ice can reduce the lift by 30 percent and increase drag by up to 40 percent.  In addition, accretions can also reduce the air intake in engines and affect readings from a (heated) Pitot tube. Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) proposes to continue the development of an integrated LIDAR instrument capable of identifying icing conditions while also allowing for air data sensing as well as other hazard detection capabilities.  The resulting Raman Icing Detection System (RIDES), when coupled with MAC's optical air data solution, will provide unprecedented situational awareness and aircraft safety. The proposed solution will operate without protrusions into the flow, behind a common flush-mounted window on the skin of the aircraft, mitigating the risk of ice build-up during operation and therefore providing a critical redundancy through dissimilar measurement of air data parameters while greatly enhancing a pilot's awareness of potential icing hazards.  MAC will build on its successful Phase I trade-study and design effort through the fabrication and demonstration of a Phase II prototype in an icing wind tunnel.* [High Frequency Reflective Mesh for Small Aperture Antennas, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yswd-c9ht) - The proposed Phase II program would develop and prototype a high frequency, high performance reflective mesh that is well suited to the emerging small aperture antenna designs. The program will build on the testing knowledge of the Phase I prototyped mesh.  40 OPI gold mesh will be prototyped and integrated to a cubesat Ka-band reflector.  Carbon nanotube yarn will also be knitted into a 30 OPI mesh and tested on a similar antenna.  The Phase II program will move the mesh to TRL 6.  The goal is to make cost effective and robust mesh for the small aperture antenna community.  RF test samples and a complete deployable Ka-band antenna will be delivered to NASA JPL for RF testing.* [Green, Compact Hybrids for Nanosatellite Launchers, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q865-2xia) - Low cost access to space is essential for continued commercial exploitation of near-earth environments, and to support future science missions. A serious limitation on the cost of space access is the available propellants and propulsion system technologies for launch, orbital insertion, maneuvering and orbital reinsertion, and reaction and attitude control.This Phase I STTR program will validate ignition and performance parameters for a volumetrically-optimized, low cost, green, shippable hybrid propellant motor for low cost access to space.  The program is specifically targeted at validating performance via fabrication and delivery of replacements for the current Nihka and PSRM-120 stages (stage 2 and 3) based on the Black Brandt sounding rocket vehicle testbed under the Nanolaunch 1200 program guidelines.* [Polarized Microwave Background Technologies for Inflationary Gravitational Wave Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/256p-r8hu) - The detection of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) from the epoch of inflation is one of the next majors goals in cosmology. These PGWs leave a signature on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) called the primordial "B-modes." The quest for detection of this signature has launched substantial technological development because this signal is predicted to be one part in a billion of the unpolarized signal.

The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a ground based telescope array which will measure the polarization of the CMB to unprecedented accuracy. This measurement will require the development of several technologies which will be required for the possible space mission outlined in the Epoch of Inflation Technology push. CLASS will be an important test-bed for these technologies and will raise the technology readiness level of several relevant instruments.

CLASS will use extremely sensitive antenna-coupled transition edge sensors and a rapid front-end polarization modulator to make a multifrequency measurement of the polarized CMB on the largest angular scales. By searching for the predicted peak in the primordial B-mode power spectrum, CLASS will detect the PGW signature if the tensor to scalar ratio is greater than 0.01.

A detection of primordial gravitational waves from the epoch of inflation would have transformative effects on the field of cosmology. The technological advances made through the development of CLASS could achieve this detection while simultaneously raising the technology readiness level for future missions.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_realtime](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tuve-fih4) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites. The orbits derived from real-time data streams are used for comparison purposes.* [Neuromorphic UAS Collision Avoidance](https://data.nasa.gov/d/666h-g8j6) - <p>Collision avoidance for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) traveling at high relative speeds is a challenging task. It requires both the detection of a possible collision and deployment of an appropriate maneuver to avoid it, to be done in few seconds or less. NASA Langley and Boston University are engaged in a collaborative effort to design neuromorphic optic flow algorithms to avoid collisions and embed these algorithms in small, low-weight, and low-power customized hardware solutions in UAS.<p/><p>Using biologically-inspired neuromorphic optic flow algorithms is a novel approach in collision avoidance for UAS. Traditional computer vision algorithms rely on solving nonlinear partial differential equation systems to estimate optic flow which is a computationally expensive task. Neuromorphic algorithms instead make use of lessons learned in biology to solve these problems in a more efficient manner. An example is the fly's motion detector, which can be modeled by a system that uses a set of locally calculated, parallel spatio-temporal correlations for a set of velocities determined by the input sampling rates and flying speeds. Correlation results are interpreted as likelihood for a motion direction and speed. Stages of obstacle detection and tracking can temporally and spatially integrate these likelihoods to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and in turn the detection rate. In addition to its computational efficiency, the proposed neuromorphic solution is more stable and noise tolerant than solving a nonlinear optimization problem. Even if single computational nodes get corrupted due to functional or structural failures in the hardware, the performance of appropriately designed parallel, distributed neuromorphic algorithms degrades gracefully. Neuromorphic algorithms are commonly implemented using software running on general-purpose multicore/graphic processing unit systems. This approach, though flexible, can have significant overhead in terms of power, performance, and is not easily portable across platforms, therefore reducing its scope of applicability. In the second phase, we will port the neuromorphic algorithms to field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application specific integrated chips (ASICs). This will allow us to meet demanding performance requirements needed in UAS such as fast processing, low weight, low power consumption, as well as robustness to hardware failure.</p>* [SMEX03 Site Photographs, Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fm7u-pjcp) - The <em>SMEX03 Site Photographs</em> data set includes photographs of the regional study areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA as part of the 2003 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX03).* [SMEX03 QuikSCAT/SeaWinds Backscatter Data, Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/r35y-k4u9) - This data set includes data collected over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA, and Brazil.

The instrument was launched on the Russian Meteor-3M spacecraft in December 2001. The Meteor-3M mission, along with the SAGE III mission, was terminated on March 6, 2006, because of a power supply system failure resulting in loss of communication with the satellite.The newest SAGE mission, SAGE III on ISS, is scheduled to launch in 2015. Plans include sending a copy of the SAGE III instrument to the International Space Station aboard a commercial Space X flight.* [Resin Infusion Fabrication of nanostructured PMC, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wdja-mzs9) - Polymer reinforced composite parts required for heavy lift launch vehicles are currently fabricated by hand lay-up or automated tape lay-up followed by curing using heat, pressure, vacuum and inert atmosphere. Composite structures for future applications are expected to be larger than 9 meters in diameter and greater than 10 meters in length. Such large composite structures cannot be fabricated by regular autoclaving processes because of limitations of the size of autoclaves and high costs associated with energy consumption. In this Phase I effort, MMI will develop a novel out-of-autoclave processing method for the fabrication of nanostructured polymer matrix composites for fabrication of light weight structural parts of large dimensions. This phase of research will also involve a system analysis of the technology to identify the benefits and target areas of use.  A correlation study based system analyses will provide a path to apply the fabrication methods to fabricate large composite parts used in aircraft structures. Phase II will scale up the technology and demonstrate property enhancements.   The resin infusion process proposed will be suitable for economical manufacture of large parts. The nanocomposite reinforcement proposed will also afford better mechanical properties to the polymer matrix composite.* [SMEX03 Vegetation Data: Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/er4r-5t5x) - This data set includes vegetation data collected over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) area of northern Alabama, USA.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nf7p-4hmu) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/whzi-55tu) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [Propulsive Descent Technology (PDT) Original Content](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gj28-293x) - Current technology does not support Mars human missions due to limitations in capability to land high mass support hardware.  If we want to send people to Mars, we need to provide a new propulsive descent capability that extends to supersonic speeds and is applicable to human missions.* [A Novel Microfluidic Device for Fully Automated Extraction of RNA from Cell Cultures, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/94qm-7vfw) - Obtaining high quality, intact RNA from cells is an ubiquitous need in the pursuit of space biology. Our overall objective is to develop and commercialize a microfluidics based miniaturized platform (MED-RNA) that can fully automate the complex process of RNA isolation. Starting from harvested whole mammalian cells in a culture medium, MED-RNA will lyse, capture, and isolate RNA content for later analysis, in a fully integrated fashion with minimal user intervention. In addition to higher yields and faster process times, losses and contamination will be minimized as a result of the miniaturization and automation. A novel and unique plastic card based fabrication technology from Micronics Corp. will be leveraged for low-cost microfabrication. 

The Phase I study successfully demonstrated concept development and design of three critical aspects of the MED-RNA, (1) on-card reagent based cell lysis, (2) non-toxic electric field driven cell lysis, and (3) RNA capture and elution in a microfluidic extraction chamber. Physical prototypes of the components were fabricated and experimentally demonstrated. During Phase II, we will further optimize the individual component designs. Optimal components, along with necessary valving will be integrated on a plastic, microfluidic lab card. The fully integrated prototype lab card will be demonstrated on chosen cell lines. Further ensuring success, CFDRC has assembled an experienced, multidisciplinary team.* [Uncooled High-Performance InAsSb Focal Plane Arrays, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a7mf-rnn4) - SVT Associates proposes an innovative digital alloy technique to extend the cutoff wavelength of InAsSb beyond 5 um, a wider band gap InAlAsSb layer inserted into depletion region to suppress dark current, and atomic layer deposition technique to coat radiation-hard material AlN on InAsSb detectors grown on GaSb substrate. This digital alloy InAsSb material system is capable of infrared detection between 0.4-5 um, depending on layer thickness of the period of each digital ultra thin superlattice. The goal of this program is to develop InAsSb-based FPA for 0.4-5 um detection at room temperature. Photo detector arrays using this material are of great interest to the NASA for various applications including, in particular, imaging and optical detection, and object discrimination when tracking targets in space or performing astronomical observations. These MWIR photo detectors can also find application to infrared-based chemical identification systems and terrestrial mapping. Applying the dark current suppression and cutoff wavelength extension process to the InAsSb-based detectors should result in higher operating temperature, extended cutoff wavelength, and radiation-hard devices, all important factors that should significantly enhance FPA operation.  We intend to characterize the positive effects of proposed techniques in Phase I.  In Phase II we will refine the techniques to realize high-performance MWIR FPAs operating at ambient temperatures.* [CER_BDS_TRMM-PFM_Edition1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bxin-j6v5) - CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data in HDF.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/egtt-ub7e) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [LGM2605 as a mitigator of space radiation-induced vascular damage, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/92ne-bn7v) - LignaMed, LLC is a drug development company with a fast track strategy to approval of LGM2605, an oral small molecule for use as a radiation mitigating agent that reduces harmful effects of radiation exposure of normal tissues. LignaMed aims to evaluate LGM2605 as a mitigator of space-radiation induced vascular damage. NASA missions to Mars will expose astronauts to solar and galactic cosmic mixed radiation including low dose &#947; and proton radiation, but data is lacking on the biological and physiological effects in humans of this mixed source radiation. Research on space radiation effects on cellular systems, molecular targets and ultimately organ systems has identified potential harmful short and long-term effects on the health of astronauts. Work at the University of Pennsylvania identified damage to lungs years after a single exposure to low-dose gamma, 56Fe, 28Si and proton radiation exposure in mice. Acute and chronic radiation effects in organs are closely associated with vascular damage and dysfunction. Multiple studies have confirmed single source radiation side effects associated with significant loss of vascular integrity: increased vascular leakiness (edema), an activated inflammatory phenotype and extensive oxidative damage. However, damage to the vascular network under multiple radiation types simultaneously is not understood. LignaMed will employ gene knockout technology in vascular models exposed to space-relevant mixed radiation regimens to investigate the injury to the vasculature. We hypothesize that LGM2605 will mitigate space radiation-induced vascular damage by inhibiting early events that cause inflammation. This study will confirm that 1) space radiation drives endovascular damage via activation of the endothelial inflammatory phenotype resulting in increased permeability and 2) will validate LGM2605 as an effective mitigator of space radiation-induced vascular damage by inhibiting early events that drive long term adverse sequellae.* [Dual Use Packaging, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pj9x-unnv) - NASA seeks down-weighted packaging compatible with microwave preparation and perhaps high hydrostatic pressure processing.  New packaging must satisfy NASA's 3-year storage mandate.  Foil laminate containers meet NASA's oxygen, moisture and general shelf life demands; however, their weight, processing and disposal characteristic are not ideal.  A previous NASA SBIR examined nanobarrier-containing packages; but these did not perform to NASA's needs.  
	The current SBIR proposes to remove oxygen electrochemically, control moisture independent of the packaging, and also carefully selecting packaging materials to perform some second generation function.  Using non-packaging-related control of oxygen and moisture allows versatile selection of primary packaging to permit packaging concepts unacceptable under NASA's existing packaging paradigm.  These include edible packaging, soluble pre-weighed reconstitutable  cartridges for beverages, and packages designed for compatibility with mission-grown foods.  Primary food packs would be bundled in an overpack designed to remove oxygen and to manage moisture. The overpack would itself serve a secondary mission function.   Overpack materials might include photovoltaic polymer sheets, light emitting plastics, or might simply serve a a waste or food storage function.  Shifting oxygen and moisture control away from packaging allows package construction from much lighter material with reduced weight, processing and disposal limitations.  A dialog on extravehicular food storage is proposed* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Aerosol Index Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kwkn-8ir7) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Aerosol Index Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

The key point to assist the smart home resident is to model the activities and discover correct realization patterns of activities. To accomplish this task, we apply sensors to provide primary data about realization patterns of actions, operations, plans, goals and generally any objective that the smart home resident may desire to do. In the consequence, by applying fuzzy clustering techniques, we are able to mine sensor data to retrieve the realization patterns of activities, and so the prediction patterns of intentions are recognizable. Comparing the realization patterns with prediction patterns of activities, we would be able to predict the intention of the resident about the activity that the resident considers to realize. In this way, we would be able to provide hypotheses about the resident goals and his possible goal achievement’s defects. Spatiotemporal aspects of daily activities such as movement of objects are surveyed to discover the patterns of activities realized by the smart homes residents. In this research, uncertainty is considered as a property of activity recognition.* [LBA-ECO LC-03 Hypsography, Rivers, Roads, and DEM, Four Areas across Brazilian Amazon](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nvz7-z46g) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides four related spatial data products for four study areas across the Brazilian Amazon: Manaus, Amazonas; Tapajos National Forest, Para Western (Santarem); Rio Branco, Acre; and Rondonia, Rondonia. Products include vector data showing (1) roads, (2) rivers, and (3) hypsography and (4) digital elevation model (DEM) images that were encoded from the hypsography vectors. There are 15 data files with this data set which includes 12 compressed *.zip files containing ArcInfo shape files and 3 GeoTIFFS.This data set contains vector data showing roads, rivers, and hypsography for each study area in ESRI ArcGIS shapefile format. The vectors were hand-digitized by the Images Company in Brazil from paper maps produced by the Brazilian government. Depending on the scale of the original maps, the digitization errors vary. For some maps, some vectors are missing. Data were manually checked for duplicate or extra vectors. These data sets were derived from several map sheets produced from aerial coverages dating from 1974 to 1978.The DEM images were encoded from the hypsography vectors and are provided in GeoTIFF format. The attribute value associated with each line and point in the vector segment is encoded into the image channel; the image channel is then filled in by interpolating image data between encoded vector data.  For each DEM:  1 image channel with pixel resolution = 25m x 25m.  DEM images are provided for Manaus, Tapajos National Forest, and Rondonia.  The files for Rio Branco were unusable due to a documentation error.DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products. KNOWN PROBLEMS:The data providers note that due to limited resources, these data have been neither validated nor quality-assured for general use. For that reason, extreme caution is advised when considering the use of these data. - Any use of the derived data is not recommended because the results have not been validated.- However, the DEM, vectors, and orthorectified SAR data (related data set) can be used if the user understands how these were produced and accepts the limitations.* [SASSI: Subsystems for Automated Subsurface Sampling Instruments, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3va7-wbue) - Autonomous surface sampling systems are necessary, near term, to construct a historical view of planetary significant events; as well as allow for the identification of materials useful for ISRU activities. Paramount to this is exploration missions capable of in-situ analysis of core samples that deliver the stratigraphy of the target. These sample handling technologies must be developed to meet a broad range of potential requirements, including a variety of rock or subsurface materials, rigorous sample preservation requirements, and the general problem of autonomous operation in the presence of dust and with limited resources. Honeybee seeks to develop critical subsystems for a small, low-mass, low-power Rotary-Percussive Corer (RoPeC) capable of autonomous sample acquisition and delivery from a depth of 5 cm. Specific attention will be given to the tall-pole items including the core break-off, retention, delivery, rotary-percussive drive, and gas flushing subsystems. Near term applications include the Astrobiology Field Laboratory and Mars Sample Return missions. Previous coring tool development has focused on integration and far-horizon proof of concepts; resulting in complete systems designed around specific requirements. The path forward lies in maturing specific aspects of designs quickly. The Phase 1 research has resulted in a survey of existing sampling systems as well as a conceptual design of the RoPeC with a focus on modularity. In Phase 2, Honeybee will mature the design of RoPeC subsystems; including the integration of a percussive voice coil actuator developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Powder Acquisition Drill System. A focus on modularity will ensure that subsystems can be redesigned independently; enabling the acquisition of core samples in targets including MEPAG suggested rocks, MSL Mars analogs and Phoenix analogs. This will lead to the a TRL of 5-6.* [Real-Time Fault Contingency Management for Integrated Vehicle Health Management, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yv2n-erq4) - Impact Technologies, with support from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Honeywell, propose to develop and demonstrate a suite of real-time Fault Contingency Management (FCM) algorithms for application within an Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) system. The proposed FCM software will implement a novel vehicle subsystem fault accommodation approach based on a seamless integration between real-time system health identification and adaptive controller techniques.  Specifically, the continuous health assessment algorithms include a real-time adaptive recursive system identification algorithm and an enhanced real-time moving horizon estimation (MHE) algorithm that will be developed and implemented on a prototype embedded system. 

The proposed FCM software hierarchy will act from the subsystems level up through the vehicle level and will implement fault-accommodating control, health management, and contingency management to accomplish its goal. The significant technology advancement proposed herein is based on the use of dynamic simulation models in a real-time computing environment to not only update health status predictions, but also to determine "on the fly" how accommodate for them.  At the conclusion of Phase I, the project team will deliver a proof-of-concept demonstration of the proposed techniques running on an embedded platform using high fidelity propulsion and aircraft simulation models.* [A Novel Technology for Simultaneous TOC Reduction and Biofouling Prevention, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dazf-46eb) - Long-duration space missions such as the upcoming Moon and Mars missions require reliable systems for the preparation of potable water through efficient recycling, and prevention of biofilm growth on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and water lines.  Lynntech, Inc. proposes a novel technology to simultaneously reduce the total organic carbon (TOC) content of biological water processor (BWP) processed water, and control biofilm formation on water lines, surfaces and membranes within the water reclamation unit utilized on board spacecraft and within future planetary habitats.  This technology is based on Lynntech's proprietary electrochemical on demand oxidizer generator, which does not require consumable chemicals. The on-demand produced oxidizer can be added to the primary processed water from the BWP unit.  Using this innovative approach in the form of a compact TOC and microbial count (MC) reduction module which will be situated in line with the BWP unit, Lynntech aims to achieve an order of magnitude reduction in the TOC content within the BWP processed water.  The residual oxidizer/disinfectant and reduced TOC will prevent the formation of biofilms on the RO membrane and water lines and will reduce the equivalent system mass by lowering the load on equipment downstream to the BWP, enabling a reduction in their size and weight.  Phase I work will concentrate on providing proof-of-concept for the technology while Phase II will involve the fabrication of a prototype TOC and MC reduction module and its integration with the Integrated Advanced Water Recovery Test System operational at NASA-JSC.* [Robust Optimal Fragmentation and Dispersion of Near-Earth Objects](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v5gs-qqib) - <p>During the past 2 decades, various concepts for mitigating the impact threats from NEOs have been proposed, but many of these concepts were impractical and not technically credible. In particular, all non-nuclear techniques require mission lead times larger than 10 years. However, for the most probable impact threat with a warning time less than 10 years, the use of high-energy nuclear explosives in space becomes inevitable for proper fragmentation and dispersion of an NEO in a collision course with Earth. However, the existing nuclear subsurface penetrator technology limits the impact velocity to less than 300m/s because higher impact velocities destroy prematurely the detonation electronic equipment. Thus, an innovative space system architecture utilizing high-energy nuclear explosives must be developed for a worst-case intercept mission resulting in relative closing velocities as high as 5-30km/s. An advanced system concept is proposed for nuclear subsurface explosion missions. The concept blends a hypervelocity kinetic-energy impactor with nuclear subsurface explosion, and exploits a 2-body space vehicle consisting of a fore body and an aft body. These 2 spacecraft bodies may be connected by a deployable boom. The fore body provides proper kinetic impact crater conditions for an aft body carrying nuclear explosives to make a deeper penetration into an asteroid body. For such a complex mission architecture design study, non-traditional, multidisciplinary research efforts in the areas of hypervelocity impact dynamics, nuclear explosion modeling, high-temperature thermal shielding, shock-resistant electronic systems, and advanced space system technologies are required. Expanding upon the current research activities, the Iowa State Asteroid Deflection Research Center will develop an innovative, advanced space system architecture that provides the planetary defense capabilities needed to enable a future real space mission more efficient, affordable, and reliable.</p>* [An Optical Wake Vortex Detection System for Super-Density Airport Operation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bhxi-t6ia) - OSI proposes to develop a wake vortex detection system including a group of double-ended and single-ended optical scintillometers properly deployed in the airfield to measure ground and near ground crosswind, turbulence, and wake vortex using atmospheric turbulence-induced optical scintillations. As part of efforts, OSI also proposes to develop a single-ended optical scintillometer, together with a retro-reflector, for the measurement of near ground real-time crosswind and wake vortex. OSI will perform system analysis and design of the proposed system to detect occurrences, location, magnitude, and persistence of wake turbulence. With the simultaneous measurements of crosswind and turbulence, the sensor system is also able to forecast the arrival time of the airplane generated wake vortex drifting to a nearby runway.

In the Phase I effort, OSI will determine the optimum siting criteria of deploying the double-ended and single-ended sensors on the airport. This includes combinations of parallel to runway, cross the runway, and retro-reflector on high towers installations. The goal is to form a network of sensors to cover essential areas of airport field to provide wake vortex data for the predictive modeling of wake vortex hazard. 

As a side benefit, the vortex detection system could measure downdraft by deploying two sets of scintillometers on both sides of the runway. The line-averaged crosswind measured by the two sets will provide real-time continuous measurements of convergence and divergence of the wind field between the two optical paths. Vertical winds, and hence the downdraft, can be derived from the measured divergence. The proposed vortex detection system will also be able to provide critical large area wind information. By incorporating this valuable information into the low-level wind shear modeling, it will greatly enhance the performance of the present airport low-level wind shear systems.* [The Enceladus Organic Analyzer](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wdya-7y6v) - Quantitative compositional and chiral organic molecule analysis is key to understanding an extraterrestrial location including its history, habitability and potential for past or present life. Few high-TRL instruments exist that can achieve this important goal. The advancement of the Enceladus Organic Analyzer (EOA) to TRL 6 will enable a powerful new approach for characterizing carbon chemistry in our solar system including the non-statistical distribution of organic molecules and optical isomers that tell us about the presence of extant or extinct life.
EOA is an innovative microchip capillary electrophoresis (μCE) system with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. The µCE electrophoretically separates molecules with high resolution, and is very effective for analysis of organics having a wide range of sizes and complexity from a variety of solid, ice or liquid sources. The integrated Programmable Microfluidic Analyzer (PMA) enables reliable, flexible fluidic processing. LIF is highly sensitive with picomolar concentration limits of detection (the equivalent of only attomoles detected).
EOA SCIENCE OBJECTIVES
Detect and quantify amines, amino acids, carboxylic acids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with parts-per-million sensitivity from samples as small as a few micrograms.
Separate multiple (>20) amine-containing species (including amino acids) that differ in isomer or carbon chain-length with baseline resolution. Perform similar analyses on carboxylic acids and polycyclic aromatics.
Separate chiral enantiomers of any observed amino acids.
EOA MISSIONS
Enceladus Plume Fly-By/Orbiter. The organic composition of the Enceladus plume is a high-priority science objective in the NASA Science Plan and the Decadal Survey prioritized an Enceladus orbiter.
Comets. The EOA could be used to sample and analyze organics from comets and their coma that are beyond sample return to answer questions about primordial sources of organic matter and current synthesis.
Icy Moon organic analysis. The core EOA analyzer instrument could also be deployed in orbiters, fly-by or lander missions that acquire solid/ice samples.
TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
Raise TRL of the PMA. This technology is at a high TRL (5) having been extensively tested in lab and challenging field applications. Our objective is to fully demonstrate the PMA in a relevant environment as an integrated prototype raising TRL to 6.
Raise TRL of LIF. LIF laser and optical detection systems have over a decade of development for space flight beginning with the Urey instrument for the ExoMars rover to the MOA instrument proposed for Mars 2020. This subsystem will be built and tested to elevate its TRL from 5 to 6.
Raise TRL of the Capture Plate System from 3 to 6. When samples for the EOA are acquired from plumes or ejecta, a capture plate collects material during a fly by. An efficient soft impact capture has been developed that obviates the confounding problem of organic contamination found with other soft impact strategies like aerogels.
Raise TRL of the integrated system including all peripheral hardware and control electronics. The TRL of most EOA components and subsystems is as high as 5. We will build and test an integrated technology demonstration unit with flight-like component subsystems raising the TRL of the whole instrument to 6.
RELEVANCE
The proposed work seeks to “develop and demonstrate” the EOA as a “planetary and astrobiology science instrument to the point where it may be proposed in response to future announcements of opportunity without additional extensive technology development (TRL 6).”
The EOA is an “innovative technology that improves instrument measurement capabilities” in a “small, low mass, low power” package, and is poised to “address significant scientific questions relevant to stated NASA goals.”
DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN is not required because this proposal is for instrument development only.* [Transport, Chemistry, and Energetics of Water in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere and Implications for Polar Mesospheric Cloud Occurrence](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7c89-a6q2) - <p>The overall goal of this proposal is to study the time-dependent neutral chemistry and transport of water in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) and to determine the resultant impact on the local temperature and ice cloud formation. To reach this goal, we will answer three science questions: 1. What is the energetic and chemical response of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere to water deposited in the lower thermosphere? 2. How does the injection of large amounts of water vapor change the thermodynamics and impact the physics of PMC formation? 3. How is the water vapor that gets injected into the lower thermosphere, redistributed vertically to the PMC region near 82 km? To answer these questions we propose to release a plume of water vapor at high latitudes from a rocket payload and observe how the atmosphere responds both during and after the release. We will observe the evolution of the plume of water with lidar measurements from Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR). The lidar is capable of tracking both the optical emissions from the region and measuring the temperature profiles. In addition, an Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM) instrument will be deployed at PFRR to observe the upper mesosphere (~87 km) before and during the water release to provide quantitative information on any dynamics/wave activity and changes in mesospheric temperature. The combination of the lidar and mapping imager thus provides strong ground-based diagnostics for the launch. The launch will be at twilight so that any formation of PMCs from the plume will be visible from the ground. Trimethyl aluminum (TMA) trails will be released in addition to the water from a separate payload canister. The TMA is chemi-luminescent and can be tracked optically from the ground with cameras and the naked eye. The movement of the TMA trails will thus provide a direct indication of how the water is moving since both will be transported by the background winds. The TMA measurements will be helpful both for real-time waater cloud tracking and for post-flight analysis. Our ground-based observations will be supported by observations from the NASA TIMED and AIM missions and modeling result from the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics General Circulation Model (TIMEGCM). We will interpret the observations of PMCs and temperature variations from the TIMED satellite that are driven by the plume chemistry with our TIMEGCM model. The TIMEGCM will be augmented to include all heating and cooling contributions from the plume water vapor, any resultant ice formation as well as vertical transport and heating of the ambient atmosphere by the ice. Model results will be compared with observed PMC data from AIM and corresponding TIMED/SABER temperatures to elucidate and understand the relationship between PMCs and bulk thermodynamics. Perceived significance: The proposed project deals with a science investigation that can be carried out with instruments flown on suborbital sounding rockets. It contributes to the science goal of &ldquo;understanding the fundamental physical processes of the space environment&rdquo; (2010 Science Plan for NASA SMD). The proposal is also relevant to the NASA Heliophysics Roadmap, including two out of three overarching objectives: (Open the Frontiers to Space Environment Prediction, and Understand the Nature of our Home in Space) and their associated Research Focus Areas. It also complements work performed under the NASA AIM and TIMED missions.</p>* ["Compact Color Biofinder" for fast, non-contact detection of bio-markers, biomolecules and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in Ocean Worlds](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fnma-pgh3) - We have developed a prototype instrument called “Standoff Biofinder” which is able to detect biomolecules and bio-markers from a collection of rocks and minerals in a large area with detection time of 0.1 s. The Standoff Biofinder takes advantage of the short lifetime of bio-fluorescent materials to obtain real-time images showing the locations of biological materials among luminescent minerals in a geological context. The instrument works in daylight as well as nighttime conditions and bio-detection capability is not affected by the background light. The Standoff Biofinder instrument will be suitable for locating fluorescent polyaromatic hydrocarbons, amino acids, proteins, bacteria, biominerals, photosynthetic pigments, and diagenetic products of microbial life both on dry landscapes as well as on Ocean Worlds of the outer Solar System (e.g., Enceladus, Europa, and Titan).
	At present, the images provided by the prototype biofinder are black and white images displaying the morphology and concentrations of biological molecules. In this proposal, we propose to develop the next generation of the instrument, “Compact Color Biofinder” (CoCoBi) which will provide color fluorescent images of biological species in a target area.  One of the advantages of the color biofinder over the present biofinder system would be ability to differentiate multiple biological materials in a target area which may contain a mixture of biological species in various concentrations. CoCoBi will be helpful in identifying the biological materials based on their fluorophore colors, along with morphologies and concentrations.  In addition, the color-biofinder will be significantly miniaturized in size and will be an ideal “search for life” future mission instrument. CoCoBi will be designed to look for ppm levels of biomaterial from a standoff distance of several centimeters in a geological setting, as well as in water and ice, with detection time less than 1 s. An important feature of the Standoff Biofinder instrument is its capability to detect biomolecules which are deeper in water and ice, without sample collection. The CoCoBi instrument will be useful for locating a biological material during future NASA rover, lander, and crewed missions to Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, Enceladus, Europa, Titan, asteroids etc. Additionally, the instrument can be used for non-contact, non-destructive detection of biological materials in priceless samples obtained from sample return missions from other planets and asteroids.
	Under this project, the TRL of the proposed compact color biofinder instrument will advance from TRL 2 to TRL 4.* [Development of Nanopore Sequencing for Automated Ocean World Life Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/x39w-j4qz) - In this COLDTech project, a solid-state nanopore instrument will be developed for the detection and study of biomarkers for microbial life in ocean world environments. The Sequencing of Life on Ocean Worlds (SeqLOW) instrument is a solid-state nanopore platform designed for the detection and characterization of polyanionic and polycationic polymers. SeqLOW heritage is derived from Oxford Nanopore’s MinION instrument, a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product. The MinION is a small, portable DNA sequencing platform that consists of protein nanopores embedded in an electrically resistant polymer material. The MinION is third generation sequencing technology and is robust enough for in situ field analysis here on Earth. The system is slated to be tested on the International Space Station in the summer of 2016. However, the integrity of the current protein nanopore membrane used in the MinION is not sufficiently robust to survive long duration space missions. The SeqLOW solid-state nanopore platform will advance current state-of-the-art nanopore sensing technology as a life detection instrument for use in future NASA missions.
SeqLOW COLDTech development goals are:
1) Development and fabrication of robust solid-state nanopore membranes with arrays of different pore diameters for detection of multiple types of biomarkers (i.e. DNA, charged proteins, amino acids, etc.).
2) Integration of the SeqLOW membranes into a microfluidic platform for in situ life detection. Microfluidics will be used to carry out sample processing, concentration, and delivery of the sample material to the solid-state membrane for analysis. Technologies and methods will be developed for sensor operation during deep space missions that eliminate: a) loss of analyte integrity, b) disruption of nanopore aperture, or c) disruption of pore current by sample interferences.
SeqLOW directly addresses the goals of the COLDTech program and NASA by “development of spacecraft-based instruments and technology for surface and subsurface exploration of ocean worlds such as Europa, Enceladus, and Titan.” SeqLOW also will address the NASA Planetary Science Division’s strategic goals and objectives and is focused on the detection of extant life in the “Ocean Worlds” of the outer Solar System.* [Raising the Technology Readiness Level of 4.7-THz local oscillators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w6rn-2xyh) - <p>The 63-&mu;m (4.744 THz) [OI] fine-structure line is the dominant cooling line of warm, dense, neutral atomic gas. Because of its great intensity in high UV photodissociation regions (PDRs) and shocks, the [OI] 63-&mu;m line is superior in probing regions of massive star formation and the centers of galaxies. It is a unique probe of PDRs, shock waves from stellar winds/jets, supernova explosions, and cloud-cloud collisions. These radiative and mechanical interactions shape the interstellar medium of galaxies and drives galactic evolution. The size scale of the interactions can excite [OI] emission over many parsecs. Moreover, the emission regions are often complex, with multiple energetic sources processing the environment. Spectrally resolved observations of the [OI] line with a heterodyne receiver array will allow users to disentangle this convoluted interaction and permit the study of the energy balance, physical conditions, morphology and dynamics of these extended regions. In this way, such a receiver array will provide new, unique, insights into the interrelationship of stars and gas in a wide range of galactic and extragalactic environments. Despite the great potential, however, astrophysical observation of the OI line has rarely been performed because the frequency (4.744THz) is beyond the reach of most of the implemented local oscillators (LOs) in sensitive heterodyne receivers involving cryogenic mixers. In this proposed 3-year project, we plan to raise the TRL of THz QCLs for local oscillator applications to 5 or beyond, so that we will bridge this &ldquo;mid-TRL gap&rdquo; between a promising and enabling technology and a mission-ready component. Such a development will significantly reduce the risk of several proposed suborbital projects such as GUSTO (The Gal/Xgal U/LDB Spectroscopic/Stratospheric THz Observatory) which is a long-duration balloon flight. The proposed systems includes a 9-element heterodyne receiver array for the 4.744-THz OI line. Those heterodyne receiver arrays will require a large LO power level in a good beam pattern. Specifically, by end of the proposed project, we will develop single-mode DFB lasers with frequency to be within 10 GHz of the target 4.744 THz line, cw output power of ~5 mW with a wall-plug power efficiency of ~0.5% at an operating temperature of ~40 K, and beam patterns narrower than 10&times;10 degrees. This proposed project mainly addresses NASA&#39;s Strategic Subgoal 3D, Discover the origin, structure, evolution, and destiny of the universe, and search for Earth-like planets. It also addresses NASA&#39;s Strategic Subgoal 3A, Study planet Earth from space to advance scientific understanding and meet societal needs; and NASA&#39;s Strategic Subgoal 3C, Advance scientific knowledge of the origin and history of the solar system, the potential for life elsewhere, and the hazards and resources present as humans explore space.</p>* [Active Battery Management System with Physics Based life modeling topology, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2dmb-7j88) - Robust Data Acquisition on flight applications enables Researchers to rapidly advance technology.  Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) and Hybrid Electric architectures rely heavily on batteries to achieve fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions.  DEP Aircraft of the future have demands for Energy Storage Systems with large counts of cells put in series and parallel to achieve needed voltage and energy levels.  The X57 Maxwell Battery comprises of over 6000 cells. As the pack goes through repeated charge/discharge cycles, as well as environmental cycles, each individual cell begins to lose its capacity.  Cell to cell capacity variation causes the entire pack to limited by the weakest cell. Traditional Passive Balancing topologies are limited in their ability to address cell mismatch on the discharge cycle.  Active balancing allows a dynamic measurement & control system to discharge cells at variable rates. With a more robust measurement & control architecture, Active topologies have the ability to integrate more advanced algorithms. These algorithms include predictive health monitoring, life based management, physics based cell modelling.  Batteries can last longer, avoid thermal runaway, and avoid maintenance.  EPS is proposing development of an active BMS concept, with associated algorithms to achieve a 40% life improvement on the X57 pack.* [Electro-Kinetic Ice Gun for Frozen Ice Plume Simulations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g6cd-ki4t) - This proposal evolved as a result of a conversation with a NASA scientist regarding plans for a mission to Europa to seek signs of life based on observed water plume emissions. With Jupiter as a bright light behind the moon, NASA was able to observe Europa in silhouette, and with ultraviolet light saw what appeared to be evidence of the plumes. If plumes exist, this is an exciting find, lead researcher William Sparks said. It means we may be able to explore that ocean, that ocean of Europa, and for organic chemicals, he added. It would allow us to search for signs of life without having to drill through miles of ice. The apparent plumes seem to be mostly around the south pole, Sparks said, although one appears farther north and may be a likelier candidate for a mission. "We presume it to be water vapor or ice particles because that's what Europa's made of, and those molecules do appear at the wavelengths we observed.
In preparation for such a mission, spacecraft will have to pass through dense clouds of ice particulates, which could damage vital instruments. Accordingly, NASA has indicated there is a need for simulating the production of ice in the size range of 50nm up through 2 microns. The NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range was designed to sent solid projectiles for studying the effects of meteorite impacts on celestial bodies and potential micro-meteoroid damage to spacecraft. At the far end of the barrel, a gunpowder explosion is used to compress hydrogen gas to as much as 1 million times atmospheric pressure. The compressed gas gets released and sent down the launch tube, firing a projectile pellet at speeds between 7,000 and 15,000 mph.  No ice particulate could survive being subjected to such massive transitory input of kinetic energy. The Ames gun was not designed for accelerating ice projectiles, so a new technology is required. Here is proposed an electrospray ice plume generator, with electrostatic acceleration.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2nji-q2mq) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [GPM SAPHIR on MT1 (PRPS) Radiometer Precipitation Profiling L2A 1.5 hours 10 km V05 (GPM_2APRPSMT1SAPHIR) at GES DISC](https://data.nasa.gov/d/trr5-sxps) - The Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate
of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence
of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation
retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals
from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial
coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument
are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.

Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the
retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and
index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information,
unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is
advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model
data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).

The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution
(regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation
estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database
provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.* [CERES Bidirectional Scans Terra FM2 Edition1-CV](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vqst-p4pn) - CER_BDS_Terra-FM2_Edition1-CV data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.

To allow for rapid sample characterization on the Moon and Mars, the in situ non-destructive Raman detection technique is a highly desirable sensing tool for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. However, current Raman systems deployed in the field are inadequate due to deleterious fluorescence interference. Fluorescence is often several orders of magnitude more intense than Raman scattering signals and its broad structures spectrum could be difficult to remove from Raman spectra. We propose to develop a new infrared fiber-optic Raman sensor that can eliminate fluorescence with significantly improved Raman sensitivity for fast field detections.  The proposed concept is based on recent technology advances in fiber lasers, fiber optic Raman probes and infrared detector arrays.  Innovative infrared fiber-optic Raman sensor enables highly sensitive fluorescence-free Raman analysis and offers flexible remote detection, so that the field spectrometer's overall performance would be intact and extremely flexible for planetary missions. No dispersive Raman system today offers the unique fluorescence elimination for rapid in-situ fiber-optic remote detection.* [Integrated Data Assimilation Architecture, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/b5xg-z26c) - The Integrated Data Assimilation Architecture (IDAA) is a middleware architecture that facilitates the incorporation of heterogeneous sensing and control devices into a unifying system with standardized application interfaces.  The architecture is standards-based (IEEE wireless standards) and is an open architecture that can be easily extended.

The proposed system will support the T3.01 Aerospace Communications topic by delivering a hybrid architecture that by design can incorporate multiple heterogeneous wireless devices and networks. Additionally, the IDAA system provides for multi-developer system extensibility, alleviating the problem of a monopolistic single-vendor implementation, where only the original developer of the middleware can efficiently extend the system functionality.* [Remote UV Fluorescence Lifetime Spectrometer, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c22e-ebjn) - The goal of this project is to develop, demonstrate, and deliver to NASA an innovative, portable, and power efficient Remote UV Fluorescence Lifetime Spectrometer (RUVPhase<SUP>TM</SUP>) for the in-situ robotic or manned crew planetary scientific exploration and investigation of surface and subsurface geophysical terrain.

This will allow the creation of high-speed 20 x 20 mm CZT detectors with 256 to 512 pixels (1 mm or less pitch). Starting with prior proven designs, we will introduce an innovative, patent-pending readout scheme that reduces digitization to only one signal per channel.  We will also replace polling methods with sparse access and an innovative technique that can keep most of the pixels operating while reading out data. These innovations may increase the ASIC event detection rate by orders of magnitude while reducing system power and processing requirements.  These innovations are essential for upgrading current gamma detection technology for future missions. There exists no ASICs today that can come close to achieving this performance.* [Adaptive Flight Envelope Estimation and Protection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u6tq-cden) - Impact Technologies, in collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative flight envelope estimation and protection system for aircraft under damage upset conditions or severe flight variations.  Through the integration of advanced fault detection (IVHM) algorithms, real-time system identification of the damage/faulted aircraft and flight envelop mapping, real-time decision support can be executed autonomously for improving damage tolerance and flight recoverability.  The core tasks to complete of this proposed workscope include: 1) Development of a strong-tracking health identification algorithm for assessing the dynamics and performance limitation of impaired aircraft; 2) Development of the adaptive flight envelope estimation process; 3) Development of the envelope protection algorithm based on adaptive neural networks that can learn the generated online dynamic models; and 4) Demonstration of the proposed technologies under realistic flight control actuator and propulsion fault conditions. A core innovation of this program is the use of the on-line, adaptive learning neural networks that are capable of generating the dynamic models and operational envelop in real-time, which can then be used to estimate limits on the controller commands while preventing envelope exceedances.  The developed techniques will be demonstrated in Phase I using an integrated aircraft model that uses the NASA MAPSS propulsion model and Generic Transport Model (GTM), with eventual demonstration using the NASA Flight Simulator at NASA Langley.* [Solar ENA Imaging Coronagraph Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6yse-kizi) - <p>Observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) provide the only way to observe solar energetic particles (SEPs) where they are accelerated.

For large-body active debris removal (LB-ADR), new technologies are required to safely capture the target debris. The interactions of these complex electromechanical systems (eg. imaging systems, robotic arms and grippers) and controllers pose challenges best addressed by hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) testing. Given the risks inherent in non-cooperative spacecraft proximity operations and the firm requirement that ADR missions do not themselves produce additional debris, realistic ground-based testing is required for risk reduction.

Our approach to HWIL contains two major advancements: (1) novel robotic technologies that overcome the limitations of existing test facilities, and (2) carefully designed spacecraft models capable of thoroughly evaluating every aspect of a capture system. The LASR Lab was built around HOMER, an omnidirectional robot designed and built specifically to emulate the 6-DOF relative-motion trajectories of spacecraft. The Phase I effort validated HOMER's capabilities and reduced to hardware the Dynamic Payload Pendulum (DPP), an actively controlled pendulum that provides the equivalent of a 5-DOF air-bearing. Together, they permit large-scale motion with accurate contact dynamics. Having identified rocket boosters as ideal LB-ADR targets, we investigated the model features necessary for realistic testing of grappling and sensing systems and for accurate dynamic response on the DPP. Leveraging the developments of Phase I and concurrent work on autonomous, vision-based navigation systems at the LASR Lab, we propose to simultaneously advance the TRL of the ground-test facility and the nav systems by performing an end-to-end simulation of an approach and capture of multiple rocket bodies.* [Solar ENA Imaging Coronagraph](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hnfp-fdj2) - <p>Observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) provide the only way to observe solar energetic particles (SEPs) where they are accelerated. The one observation of solar ENAs to date had low sensitivity, a high energy threshold, and no imaging information. The Solar Energetic Neutral-atom Imaging Coronagraph (SENIC) instrument concept combines large detector area, a low energy threshold, and high angular resolution. The key design challenge for this concept was to minimize the level of stray light illuminating the detectors.<p/><p>Measurements of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) are a new tool to improve our understanding of energy release and particle acceleration in solar eruptive events.  Due to limitations of past observations, even the most basic questions remain unanswered about the acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs) by shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs).  ENAs provide the only way to observe SEPs where they are accelerated.  The one observation of solar ENAs to date had low sensitivity, a high energy threshold, and no imaging information. The Solar Energetic Neutral-atom Imaging Coronagraph (SENIC) instrument concept is designed to observe ENAs from <~20 keV to a few hundred keV with a spectral resolution as good as 1 keV and image them from 2 R_sun to 40 R_sun with a spatial resolution of 0.1 R_sun.  Since ENAs cannot be imaged with focusing optics, this concept uses an indirect imaging technique similar to the one successfully used on RHESSI.  Thus, the SENIC instrument concept combines large detector area, a low energy threshold, and high angular resolution.</p>* [Hybrid LIBS and Raman Spectroscopy Standoff Detection System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mvdz-63dc) - To address the NASA need for robotic platform-mounted instruments that can chemically analyze extraterrestrial surfaces, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new integrated standoff Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman Spectroscopic (LIBRA) system to perform rapid material analysis from a distance of >20 m.  Dual LIBS and Raman measurements ensure high specificity in chemical analysis.  While LIBS identifies trace elements, Raman spectroscopy enables the robotic rover to distinguish complex materials such as hydrous and anhydrous gypsum that indicate the presence of water on a planet.  This system features embedded chemical fingerprinting software for real-time analysis of material signatures, and has a software interface to NASA robotic platforms.  Through POC's compact excitation laser and high-resolution spectral detection subassemblies, LIBRA has unprecedented specificity of material identification in an energy efficient (<10 W), compact (<0.03 cubic meter volume), light (<2 kg) hermetically sealed package that is ruggedized (no moving parts) and optimized for robotic exploration.  In Phase I, POC will demonstrate LIBRA system feasibility by assembling and testing a proof-of-concept laboratory prototype, and investigate issues of space qualification.  In Phase II a fully functional prototype system will be developed and its standoff detection capability from robotic platforms will be demonstrated.* [Low Profile, Low Frequency, Adaptively-Tuned Acoustic Liner, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/acnm-hw8v) - Conventional approaches to aircraft engine noise reduction via passive acoustic liners are limited in performance, particularly at lower frequencies, where improvements are gained through increased liner depth. Typical engine nacelle installation clearances, however, limit liner depth and prevent further improvements in low frequency noise reduction using these conventional approaches.

The proposed innovation addresses these limitations via a low-profile, tunable acoustic liner for modern aircraft engines capable of significant noise attenuation at lower frequencies than currently achievable.  The innovative approach lowers the resonant frequency and enables significant reductions in cavity size and volume.  Significant net weight savings is achieved due to the large reductions in cavity volume (via corresponding decreases in cavity wall surface area).  The end result is lower frequency noise attenuation with simultaneous reductions in liner depth and weight.

The proposed innovations provide the following benefits for acoustic noise reduction:
?  Optimum absorption of sound at frequencies half of those achievable with  currently available technologies 
?  Decreased liner depth
?  Decreased liner weight
?  In-situ, automatic tunability for optimum absorption under different engines and engine conditions.
?  Broadband operation through MDOF performance and individual impedance tuning* [Hybrid Active-Passive Radiation Shielding System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sp9z-cwjd) - <p>A radiation shielding system is proposed that integrates active magnetic fields with passive shielding materials. The objective is to increase the shielding effectiveness against galactic cosmic radiation (GCR).&nbsp; Active shielding alone requires high power, and passive shielding alone requires high mass.&nbsp; The hybrid shield has the potential to address both these issues. &nbsp;</p> <p>The problem is that we have a vision of landing humans on Mars in the 2030s, but we do not yet know how to protect them from the space radiation.&nbsp; We are developing radiation shielding based on integrating active magnetic fields with passive shielding materials to increase the shielding effectiveness against galactic cosmic radiation (GCR).&nbsp; Active shielding alone requires high power, and passive shielding alone requires high mass.&nbsp; The hybrid shield has the potential to address both these issues of power and mass.&nbsp; The goal is to develop an optimized system of hybrid active-passive radiation shielding.&nbsp; Currently, there is no clear-cut solution to shielding humans from GCR during long duration space travel (more than 6 months from Earth to Mars, one way) and during planetary stays for exploration.&nbsp; Two different approaches exist:&nbsp; (1) choose the right passive materials combinations to slow down the GCR and the secondaries arising out of the interactions of the GCR with intervening matter; or (2) use active magnetic fields to deflect the GCR.&nbsp; These two approaches have limitations, necessitating a new approach like the proposed hybrid shielding.&nbsp; In the new hybrid shield approach, the GCR is bent by the magnetic field, and instead of traveling in a straight path it bends and takes a longer path, thus reducing the required mass of the passive shield component.&nbsp; The passive shielding materials reduce the speed of the incoming particles and thereby reduce the required magnetic field intensity and therefore reduce the power requirements of the active shield component.&nbsp; The combined effects of increased path length and reduced particle speed are two critical controlling factors for realizing improved shielding effectiveness.&nbsp; Preliminary results were obtained by using the Geant (Geometry and Tracking) 4 physics code in two-dimensional and three-dimensional radial simulations.&nbsp; The results show reduction in dose equivalent to human phantoms.&nbsp; Viable radiation shielding against GCR can be an enabler for human exploration of space.&nbsp; The success will have a huge impact on human exploration and operations missions in terms of the protection of humans for space exploration.&nbsp; It will be measured by the increased number of safe days in space.&nbsp; The systematic approach using the best and validated simulation tools to develop and down select viable concepts mitigates the risks of this approach.&nbsp; The effort aims to develop a series of simulations providing for analyses of shielding systems in sufficiently realistic detail to enable comprehensive understanding of the benefits provided and the relative merits of various optimizations.&nbsp; Given that the proposed simulation engine uses a Monte&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Carlo approach, it is generally best initially to go with the simplest configuration that meets requirements, so stable statistical results can be achieved more easily and with less computational time.&nbsp; In later steps of the optimization, it is necessary to invest the required time to ensure that the physical processes are accurately implemented, so all the important features are correctly modeled in order to get accurate and meaningful simulations.&nbsp; The potential payoff is high because the resulting hybrid active-passive shield concept could enable long duration space travel and space exploration for humans.&nbsp; This approach might also be useful for developing radiation protection for ion beam therapies on Earth. The progress will be measured by* [Ultraprecision Pointing Accuracy for SmallSat/CubeSat Attitude Control Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wvse-2w8f) - The primary objective of the Phase I investigation is to develop and demonstrate an innovative solution that can enable very high precision pointing accuracy (<0.08 degree nominal; <0.03 degree extended goal) at fast slew rates; providing part of a advanced Smallsat/CubeSat precision attitude determination and control system (PADCS) that can meet emerging very stringent missions requirements.  The Phase I program aim is to design and fabricate initial prototype hardware, including power electronics and Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) modifications as to demonstrating such positional accuracy capability, power cost (peak and average power consumption), slew rates and mass/volume cost of the new solution.  A critical objective of Phase I will be to develop at the decoupled control architecture for the new multi-stage Attitude Control System ACS controller that will be modeled, simulated, and then converted to hardware prototype for Phase I assessments.  This goal is to integrate this prototype controller into a multi-stage (ACS) design hardware emulation testbed and evaluate actual performance before conclusion of the program.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Ecosystems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mbmh-jf8e) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Ecosystems provides data and information on the extent and classification of ecosystems circa 2000, including   coastal, cultivated, forest and woodlands, inland water bodies, islands, marine, mountains (elevation), polar, and urban. The data set also includes socioeconomic reporting units and the   location of regional MA projects. The data were used in a number of different ways in the assessment, contributing to an understanding of how humans have altered ecosystems, how changes in   ecosystem services have affected human well-being, and how ecosystem changes may affect people in future decades.* [Ullage Compatible Optical Sensor for Monitoring Safety Significant Malfunctions, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rsr8-zagq) - Significant emphasis has been placed on aircraft fuel tank safety following the TWA Flight 800 accident in July 1996.  Upon investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the explosion of the center wing tank (CWT) resulted most likely from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture.  The growing concern of aircraft fuel tank safety has taken an added dimension in the post 9/11 world where both commercial and military aircrafts are vulnerable to terrorist attacks utilizing MANPADS (MAN-Portable Air Defense Systems), explosives in shoe/socks, and small arms fire.  Fuel tanks also need protection from explosions caused by ballistic impact, lightning, and other sources of ignition.  In Phase I,  InnoSense LLC has demonstrated the feasibility of an all-optical oxygen sensor capable of detecting oxygen at 40,000 feet elevation down to the ambient level.  This Phase II proposal discusses how InnoSense LLC would develop a prototype and perform field testing. The project team possesses seventy person-years of optical sensor related hardware and software expertise.  InnoSense has attracted $300,000 in Phase III follow-on funding for further engineering.  Innosense will deliver the prototype to NASA, complete with software, manuals, and schematics.* [ESPA Based Secondary Payload Orbit Maneuvering System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dxpx-png5) - Busek Co. Inc. proposes to develop/design an integrated propulsion, power, ACS, and separation module for secondary ESPA payloads. The standardized secondary payload orbit maneuvering system (OMS) will have; 1) 200 W or 600 W Hall effect thruster system for primary propulsion, 2) Xe cold gas thrusters for propulsive ACS, 3) solar array, batteries and power conditioning with steady state power of ¡Ö230/680W and 4) an integral structure that supports the payload and a LightBand separation mechanism for the ESPA ring.
 
The proposed system architecture is based upon an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA).  Because the ESPA OMS has power, avionics, and propulsion, it is a free flying spacecraft capable of delivering payloads to disparate altitudes and inclinations.  In Phase I, Busek will design an OMS to meet NASA mission needs including deploying large numbers of micro satellites and CubeSats.  Preliminary analysis suggests the each secondary OMS can provide 780 m/sec delta velocity to a 125 kg payload.  A key Phase I activity will be a prototypical orbital deployers adapter for clusters of CubeSat.  With this adapter, the system could deliver large numbers of CubeSats to discrete, pre-defined orbits.  Phase II products will include a clustering adapter ready to fly in 2010, along with the OMS propulsion system.* [A Systems Engineering Approach to Electro-Mechanical Actuator Diagnostic and Prognostic Development](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e8t7-qac7) - The authors have formulated a Comprehensive Systems Engineering approach to Electro-Mechanical Actuator (EMA) Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system development. The approach implements software tools to integrate simulation-based design principles and dynamic failure mode and effects analysis. It also provides automated failure mode insertion and propagation analysis, PHM algorithm design and verification, full dynamic simulations, code generation, and validation testing. This process aims to produce the appropriate fault detection and prediction algorithms needed for successful development of an EMA PHM system. 

As an initial use case, the developed approach was implemented to develop and validate a model-based, virtual sensor software package for landing gear EMA PHM. This effort included creation of a dynamic, component-level system model that can be used to virtually sense parameters, detect degradation, isolate probable root cause, and assess severity. This model is also used as a virtual test bed for performing fault insertion analysis to address algorithm development and experimental prioritization. The developed model was validated using data from a test stand, which was specifically constructed for EMA PHM development. The model-based predictor was then coupled with failure mode diagnostics, advanced knowledge fusion, and failure mode progression algorithms to form a complete prototype EMA PHM solution.

These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.* [Live-Axis Turning for the Fabrication of Non-Rotationally Symmetric Optics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9gz5-nq8u) - The goal of this proposal is to develop a new method to create Non-Rotationally Symmetric (NRS) surfaces that overcomes the limitations of the current techniques and is fast, accurate and inexpensive.  Diamond turning (DT) has revolutionized the fabrication of lightweight optical surfaces for defense and science applications such as forward-looking infrared radar and infrared spectrometers.  It has made this impact not only because it can accurately and rapidly fabricate diffractive, refractive and reflective optical surfaces, but because it can create reference features tied to the optical surfaces to guarantee optical alignment.  An emerging trend in optical design is the use of NRS surfaces that reduce complexity, bulk and weight.  To create these surfaces, DT machines have been modified with a low-amplitude Fast Tool Servo, a third axis or a fly-cutter.  The problem with the FTS is its limited range and the other techniques are plagued by thermal drift during long fabrication times.  The proposed Live Axis Turning (LAT) process combines evolving technologies of air bearings, linear motors, high-resolution encoders and high-speed control systems into a moving lightweight toolpost on a conventional DT machine.  The result is a more flexible machine that can increase production and reduce cost for NRS components.* [LBA-ECO LC-39 MODIS Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mrn5-wyn7) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides active fire locations and estimates of annual fire frequencies for South America from 2000-2007. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm. There are 14 data files with this data set: 7 GeoTIFF (.tif) files of fire frequency at MODIS 250 m resolution, where each grid cell value represents the number of days in that year on which active fires were detected, and 7 shape files of active fire locations for the years 2001-2007.* [Distributed Leak Detection System Using Structure-Borne Noise, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j3nz-k7j4) - Manned spacecraft are vulnerable to air leaks caused by micrometeoroid and space debris impact.  The ability to detect and quickly locate and mitigate a pressure vessel breach is critical to the safety of any long duration spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or a proposed lunar base or mission to Mars.  Current NASA protocol for finding a spacecraft leak uses a handheld ultrasonic directional microphone, similar to those widely deployed industrially, to detect the 40 kHz airborne ultrasonic hiss generated by the downstream leak turbulence.  However, known limitations exist regarding the use of airborne ultrasonic emissions for locating leaks in the spacecraft environment because the downstream side of the leak occurs into the vacuum of space, creating reduced leak noise inside the pressure vessel.  Blockages of the transmission of airborne ultrasonic energy by structural components, avionics, and equipment racks also limit the detection range of such systems.  An alternative approach that we propose is to monitor the spacecraft structure itself---the pressure vessel skin---for leak-generated surface-borne ultrasound by means of a flexible and modular electronics package with fully integrated surface sensor arrays, data acquisition electronics, and radio frequency communication capabilities.* [Precision Membrane Optical Shell (PMOS) Technology for RF/Microwave to Lightweight LIDAR Apertures, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/h8ud-94p8) - Membrane Optical Shell Technology (MOST) is an innovative combination of 1) very low areal density (40 to 200g/m2) optically smooth (<20 nm rms), metallic coated reflective membrane thin films, 2) advanced fabrication techniques that transform the films into self supporting shells through the introduction of permanent optically relevant double curvature, and 3) discrete active boundary control to enable rigid body alignment and maintainment of surface figure in face of environmental disturbances.  Areal densities of better than 2 kg/m2 (including actuators) are projected.  Current measured surface figure is  &#8776;1 to 10 microns rms at up to the 15 cm size, and we are poised for further improvements.  Demonstrated material and fabrication techniques are scaleable to at least the 2m+ diameter single surface apertures and larger apertures are possible through segmentation techniques.  Proven stowage and deployment techniques enable space flight application.  We propose advancing 1) the basic fabrication technology and 2) the TRL level of MOST apertures for ground and space based apertures.  The key resulting innovation is implementation of low areal density, compact roll stowable approaches to realize low mass, low cost reflective apertures for RF/Microwave to LIDAR.  Other NASA and DOD applications are expected as precision and aperture size increase.* [Prognostics Enhanced Reconfigurable Control of Electro-Mechanical Actuators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ivck-kxtd) - Actuator systems are employed widely in aerospace, transportation and industrial processes to provide power to critical loads, such as aircraft control surfaces. They must operate reliably and accurately in order for the vehicle / process to complete successfully its designated mission. Incipient actuator failure conditions may severely endanger the operational integrity of the vehicle / process and compromise its mission. The ability to maintain a stable and credible operation, even in the presence of incipient failures, is of paramount importance to accomplish “must achieve” mission objectives. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the fault-tolerant design of critical subsystems, such as an ElectroMechanical Actuator (EMA), that takes advantage of on-line, real-time estimates of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) or Time-to-Failure (TTF) of a failing component and reconfigures the available control authority by trading off system performance with control activity. The primary goal is to complete critical mission objectives within a time window dictated by prognostic algorithms so that the fault mode is accommodated and an acceptable level of performance maintained for the duration of the mission. The proposed fault-tolerant control design is mathematically rigorous, generic and applicable to a variety of application domains. An EMA is used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.* [LBA-ECO LC-18 Hyperion 30-m Surface Reflectance, Mato Grosso, Brazil: July 2004](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wz9h-5qhw) - This image was collected by the Hyperion sensor on 10-July-2004 at 13:16:16 GMT.  It was calibrated to apparent surface reflectance using the ACORN atmospheric model.The Hyperion imager has a spectral range of 400-2500 nm, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, spatial resolution of 30 m, and a swath width of 7.8 km. Sampling is scene based (256 samples, 512 lines) (http://eo1.usgs.gov/sensors.php).  Through these large number of spectral bands, complex land ecosystems can be imaged and accurately classified.Data from the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer may greatly increase our ability to estimate the presence and structural attributes of selective logging in the Amazon Basin using four biogeophysical indicators not yet derived simultaneously from any satellite sensor: 1) green canopy leaf area index; 2) degree of shadowing; 3) presence of exposed soil and; 4) non-photosynthetic vegetation material. Airborne, field and modeling studies have shown that the optical reflectance continuum (400-2500 nm) contains sufficient information to derive estimates of each of these indicators. Our ongoing studies in the eastern Amazon basin also suggest that these four indicators are sensitive to logging intensity. Satellite-based estimates of these indicators should provide a means to quantify both the presence and degree of structural disturbance caused by various logging regimes.* [VIIRS/NPP Active Fires 6-Min L2 Swath 375m NRT](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gudv-u89p) - The VNP14IMG_NRT is a Near Real Time (NRT) S-NPP/VIIRS 375 m active fire detection data product (Schroeder 2014). The product is built on the EOS/MODIS fire product heritage [Kaufman et al., 1998; Giglio et al., 2003], using a multi-spectral contextual algorithm to identify sub-pixel fire activity and other thermal anomalies in the Level 1 (swath) input data. The algorithm uses all five 375 m VIIRS channels to detect fires and separate land, water, and cloud pixels in the image. Additional 750 m channels complement the available VIIRS multispectral data. Those channels are used as input to the baseline active fire detection product, which provides continuity to the EOS/MODIS 1 km Fire and Thermal Anomalies product.

The VIIRS 375 m fire detection data is a Level 2 product based on the input Science Data Record (SDR) Level 1 swath format. The NRT product is currently available through NASA?s the Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE). The data are formatted as HDF4 files. Complementary ASCII files containing the short list of fire pixels detected are also available through LANCE processing systems.

	We propose a three-year effort to upgrade our existing sub-arcsecond Lyman-alpha telescope payload to improve the observing cadence by a factor of 2, increase the signal-to-ratio by a factor of 4, and launch the payload twice. With this upgraded performance, we will be able to investigate a number of scientific questions regarding the structure and heating of the solar atmosphere that address NASA&amp;rsquo;s Strategic Goal to understand the Sun and its effects on Earth and the Solar System. Specifically, the ultra-high resolution and high-temporal cadence VAULT2.0 science program and associated launch campaigns will answer the following five questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;What is the role of Type-II spicules in the transfer of energy and mass across the chromosphere-corona interface? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;Does neutral plasma absorption of the EUV emission from active region moss explain the discrepancies in the models of coronal loop heating? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;Where are the photospheric footpoints of coronal loops? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;What is the structure of coronal holes in the Lyman-alpha temperature range? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;What is the absolute abundance of H I at the base of the solar wind? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite decades of ground-based observations, the chromosphere remains one of the least understood layers of the solar atmosphere because of our limited understanding of the physical processes that govern it. In the last few years, the chromosphere has been propelled to the forefront of solar physics research thanks to spectacular new observations from space (Hinode/SOT and VAULT), and ground (e.g., SOUP, IBIS, DOT, SST), and the advent of sophisticated numerical simulations which are beginning to address the complex physics of the optically thick chromospheric plasmas and are opening up the interpretation of the observations. With these new capabilities come exciting new ideas regarding the role of the chromosphere in supplying the mass and energy to heat the corona, the nature of filaments, and the contribution of chromospheric jets to the solar wind. These ideas are challenging our traditional views of coronal heating (a long-standing mystery of solar physics), the existence of the &amp;lsquo;transition region&amp;rsquo;, the role of neutral plasmas in coronal emission and even the dominance of magnetic fields at coronal heights. The recent SMEX selection of a chromosphere-oriented mission, IRIS, is further evidence for the renewed importance of chromospheric physics. Observational limitations, however, are impeding further development and validation of these ideas. &lt;strong&gt;Both theoretical and observational considerations point to the importance of tracing the mass and energy on &lt;em&gt;small spatial scales through the upper chromosphere and transition region &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(e.g., De Pontieu et al. 2007a, 2009, 2011; Vourlidas et al. 2010). This layer corresponds roughly to the temperature range from 10,000K (ground-based H&amp;alpha;) to 80,000K (space-based HeI). The requirement for high spatial- and temporal-resolution observations in this temperature range cannot be met fully by current instrumentation. Narrow-band, high-resolution images from TRACE, Hinode, STEREO and SOHO have inadequate temperature coverage or poor resolution. The SDO/AIA observations are skewed towards higher temperature plasmas. The SOHO spectrometers CDS and SUMER have good temperature coverage and fidelity, but limited spatial and temporal resolution and more importantly, limited operational lifetime. Hinode/EIS observations are mostly confined to the upper solar atmosphere while SOT observations are confined to the lower chromosphere (&amp;le; 10,000K). The forthcoming IRIS satellite will partially cover the gap between chromosphere and transition region by obtaini* [MISR Level 3 FIRSTLOOK Component Global Land Product covering a day V002](https://data.nasa.gov/d/suv3-tgge) - The MISR Level 3 FIRSTLOOK Component Global Land Product contains a daily statistical summary of directional hemispherical reflectance (DHR), photosynthetically active spectral region (DHR-PAR), DHR for near-infrared band (DHR-NIR), fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), DHR-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface bidectional reflectance factor (BRF) model parameters, classified into six vegetated and one non-vegetated types.

Data from the onboard health monitoring sensors needs to be accommodated within a small fraction of this downlink bandwidth. The problem is more acute for interplanetary missions, where the downlink data rate is significantly lower than the low earth orbit missions. Such constraint prohibits transmission of the complete set of health monitoring data. 

This proposed Phase-II effort is geared towards providing enhanced remote diagnostics using limited telemetry bandwidth. Diagnostic accuracy of health management system depends more on the information content of the monitored data, than on its sheer volume. We propose accommodating more information within the allocated downlink bandwidth for health monitoring by performing intelligent data reduction. The onboard data reduction process employs sensor fusion, dimensionality reduction and temporal fusion techniques.* [Poverty Mapping Project: Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pg7t-47w5) - The Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition dataset consists of estimates of the 

percentage of children with weight-for-age z-scores that are more than two standard deviations below the median of the NCHS/CDC/WHO 

International Reference Population. Data are reported for the most recent year with subnational information available at the time of 

development. The data products include a shapefile (vector data) of percentage rates, grids (raster data) of rates (per thousand in 

order to preserve precision in integer format), the number of children under five (the rate denominator), and the number of 

underweight children under five (the rate numerator), and a tabular dataset of the same and associated data. This dataset is produced

Ground measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) were made using the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer and Sunfleck PAR ceptometer, respectively, during focused periods from August 20 to August 28, 2000 at a dry grassland site adjacent to the Sua Pan. The 1 km by 1 km sampling grid was a homogeneous, relatively dense grassland, with a height of 20-100 cm and two prevalent grass types, Odyssea paucinervis and Sporobolus spicatus. Associated reflectance measurements were made with the PARABOLA and ASD instruments (Helmlinger et al., 2004a; 2004b).The data files contain measurements of LAI and PAR reflectance and transmission and a description of sky conditions during the sampling periods. With one exception, all measurements were made under clear sky conditions.  PAR data were measured only on the transect scale while LAI are provided at both pixel and transect scales. PAR readings were performed at 93 transect sample points, and LAI readings were performed at 135 (93 transect and 42 subgrid) sample points. Each file also contains mean LAI and PAR values. The data files are ASCII tables, in comma-separated-value format.* [MOPITT Beta CO gridded daily means (Thermal Infrared Radiances) V107](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gnp8-gm77) - The MOPITT Beta L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals and belong to an unvalidated beta product subject to recalibration.

The measurements include: air temperature, specific humidity, module of wind speed, downward long wave and shortwave radiation at the surface, surface pressure, precipitation, and carbon dioxide (CO2). These atmospheric data are provided at 1 hour time-steps. These data were used as the standardized forcing data input for the LBA Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-MIP).The LBA-MIP goal was to gain comparative understanding of ecosystem models that simulate energy, water, and CO2 fluxes over the LBA area. The task was to subject all the models to the same forcing and experimental protocol, and to compare the outputs. The protocol is provided as a companion file, lba_mip_protocol4.0_20100309.pdf.The source meteorological observations for the forcing data, from the nine Brazilian flux towers, were recently published as Saleska, et al. (2013). See related data sets. These source data were gap-filled according to the LBA-MIP standard protocol. Note that the CAX forest tower was not included in the MIP. See the companion file driver_data.pdf for additional gap-filling information.There are 34 data products with this data set and they are provided in both text (.txt) and ALMA-compliant NetCDF (.nc) formats. The files have been compressed into nine *.zip files according to site.* [ESPA Based Secondary Payload Orbit Maneuvering System, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g7ay-qwin) - Busek proposes to develop an integrated propulsion, power, ACS, (ProPACS) system for micro-spacecraft deployed from the ESPA ring secondary payload ports. The standardized ProPACS system integrates the essential elements needed for highly capable micro-spacecraft bus including; 1) 600 W Hall effect thruster system for primary propulsion, 2) Xe cold gas thrusters for propulsive ACS, 3) articulated solar array, batteries and power management and distribution (PMAD) system with steady state power of 700W available to the payload when propulsion is off and 4) an integral structure that supports the payload and a LightBand separation mechanism for the ESPA ring.  The ProPACS can provide over 1,800 m/sec deltaV to a 181 kg spacecraft with a 80kg payload.

In Phase 1 ProPACS system architecture design was completed and all major components were identified.  Mass, power, data budgets were developed and major interfaces were specified.  

Phase 2 focus will be on the ProPACS elements with lower TRL to achieve system wide TRL6 at the end of the program.  The thruster will be advanced to near flight level, two PMAD systems will be evaluated and one selected and the ProPACS integral structure supporting the payload and separation ring will be designed and built.* [Hybrid Heat Pipes for High Heat Flux Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2nnh-n32f) - The thermal transport requirements for future spacecraft missions continue to increase, approaching several kilowatts. At the same time the heat acquisition areas have trended downward, thereby increasing the incident heat flux. Current incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2. This is a severe limitation for axial groove aluminum/ammonia constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs). The maximum heat flux in a CCHP is set by the boiling limit, which typically start at 5 W/cm2 for axial grove wicks, and 20-30 W/cm2 for powder metal wicks. The innovation is to develop CCHPs with a hybrid wick, which has a sintered evaporator wick, and a conventional grooved adiabatic and condenser wick.  These hybrid wicks can operate at higher heat fluxes, allowing the use of higher power laser diodes.  They also allow the use of Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) in Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, which must operate at tilts up to 45°.  Conventional aluminum/ammonia heat pipes can only operate with a 0.1 inch tilt, so they are unsuitable.  Loop Heat Pipes can also operate with tilting, but they are two orders of magnitude more expensive.  A hybrid grooved and sintered wick CCHP will allow operating at higher heat fluxes as compared to axial groove design and can also operate against gravity on the planetary surface, operate in space, carrying power over long distances, act as a thermosyphon on the planetary surface for Lunar and Martian landers and rovers, and demonstrate a higher transport capability than an all-sintered wick.* [An Ideal Integrating Bolometer Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/weqe-p8h6) - <p>We propose to develop a novel detector to enable a new class of far-IR spectroscopic surveys.&nbsp; The detector, the Ideal Integrating Bolometer (IIB) is able to circumvent some of the inherent limitations on bolometers, and thus achieve dramatic improvement in sensitivity.<br />&nbsp;</p> <p>An ideal integrating bolometer can achieve breakthrough sensitivity in IR photon detection by removing practical barriers to extreme thermal isolation of the absorber.&nbsp; The effort will be focused on design of the IIB, with the goal of having a layout ready.&nbsp; During this period, we will also design parts needed for the test facility and start fabrication.&nbsp; In the second quarter, the IIBs will be fabricated.&nbsp; Also during this period, the test facility will be assembled and dry run testing completed.&nbsp; In the third quarter, the IIB samples will be installed in the cryostat and tested.

Chemical and mineralogical characterizations are critical components of this exploration. Infrared spectrometers provide a new spectroscopic capability to interrogate the feature-rich region of long-wave infrared. The objective of this work was to develop high performance in house long-wave barrier (8 &mu;m) infrared (LWIR) detectors tailored for the use in planetary spectrometers for characterization of primitive bodies.</p>
 <p>Currently, the major impediment for long wavelength instrumentation is the availability of sensitive detectors that can cover the region of interest &ndash; wavelengths up to approximately 7.5 &mu;m (or wavenumbers less than &asymp; 1330 cm1). Long-wave limits of current and recent spectrometers are 3 &mu;m (M3), 3.92 &mu;m (CRISM), and 5.1 &mu;m (VIMS). While useful for hydrides (and nitriles, CO, and CO2 for VIMS), these limited ranges are unsuitable for detection and characterization of most molecules and minerals of planetary interest and especially organic molecules. As an example, while the C-H stretch band in the 3-&mu;m region can indicate the presence of hydrocarbons, this band is not indicative of the type of chemical or functional group, i. e. alcohols, organic acids, esters, etc. Identification of these molecules requires information from other (and stronger) transitions occurring at longer wavelengths. Detection of such spectra in remote-sensing or in situ applications often requires high sensitivity long-IR detectors, particularly for diffusely reflected sunlight in outer solar system measurements. The high-quality detectors generally required for space and astronomical detectors were originally developed for the military, with the cut-off wavelengths chosen to match spectral transmission windows of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere (below 5 &mu;m for mid-IR and above 10 &mu;m for long-IR regions). Consequently, detectors with cut-off wavelengths between 5 and 10 &mu;m have never been produced in quantity and are not available except expensive custom items (multi million dollars) by external vendors. The unknown detector performance of external vendors such as environmental/planet radiation increases the risk of using detectors from external providers and increases the instrument cost to verify these components under these conditions. Therefore, the costs of such detectors are in the millions of dollar range with lead times longer than one year. This is a major driver in the overall cost of spectroscopic planetary instruments and poses a significant risk to the timely and successful delivery of the instruments. Therefore, the development of an in-house detector capability at the target 8 &mu;m wavelength with a route towards integration into planetary spectrometers takes away the risk and cost associated with external vendors and will make JPL&rsquo;s planetary instruments extremely competitive.</p>* [Automated Service Discovery using Autonomous Control Technologies, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hjc4-2yqs) - With the advent of mobile commerce technologies, the realization of pervasive computing and the formation of ad-hoc networks can be leveraged to the benefit of the NASA Spaceports in several technical areas.  The Automated Service Discovery (ASD) architecture will allow a portable real-time Expert System to be used to aid in the Service Discovery, management of communications links, and fault detection isolation and recovery for vehicle health management.  The ASD system will allow significant cost reductions for fielding and maintaining systems at the Spaceports.  Flight systems can save weight by relying on encrypted wireless links rather than connections to a wiring harness for data transfer.  Ground based systems can reconfigure on the fly using wireless and connection oriented ad-hoc networks.

This proposal also addresses the need for a standardized command, control and monitor system for ground and space infrastructure.  ASD will use the same Expert System for execution of the ASD algorithms to derive suggestions for least-cost paths for data connectivity.   The ASD system will provide a capability for the real-time Expert System to query for service capabilities and adjust goals and constraints based on available resources.  The ASD implementation will be machine, language, and operating system neutral.* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jwm3-dnmz) - ABSTRACT: The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. FASIR-NDVI data are also used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface. There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.* [Intelligent Flamefinder Detection and Alert System (IFDAS), Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/svtp-cpga) - Current hydrogen flame detection systems exhibit shortcomings ranging from limited detection range, to localization inaccuracy, limited sensitivity, false alarms, and inability to self-diagnose failures. During Phase I. International Electronic Machines Corporation IEM created and tested a prototype version of an Intelligent FlameFinder Detection and Alert System (IFDAS), demonstrating that IEM's system could accurately detect, track, and localize hydrogen flames and reliably discriminate between hydrogen flames and over two dozen sources of false alarms including reflections of flames or the sun, welding, other flame sources, etc., using a unique, innovative, and expandable Flame Detection Expert System design. In Phase II, IEM proposes to develop a full working prototype system employing multiple IFDAS sensor units, an enhanced flame detection expert system, and a comprehensive user interface including means for notifying emergency personnel when a fire is detected. This IFDAS Prototype will be demonstrated under real-world conditions at Stennis Space Center.* [MOPITT Beta CO gridded monthly means (Near and Thermal Infrared Radiances) V107](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qwyv-wv5x) - The MOPITT Beta L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals and belong to an unvalidated beta product subject to recalibration.

Data from the MODIS sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm.* [NACP MsTMIP: Global and North American Driver Data for Multi-Model Intercomparison](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bnde-mmt8) - This data set provides environmental data that have been standardized and aggregated for use as input to carbon cycle models at global (0.5-degree resolution) and regional (North America at 0.25-degree resolution) scales. The data were compiled from selected sources (Table 2) and integrated into gridded global and regional collections of climatology variables (precipitation, air temperature, air specific humidity, air relative humidity (NA only), pressure, downward longwave radiation, downward shortwave radiation, and wind speed), time-varying atmospheric CO2 concentrations, time-varying nitrogen deposition, biome fraction and type, land-use and land-cover change, C3/C4 grasses fractions, major crop distribution, phenology, multiple soil characteristics, and a land-water mask. The temporal ranges of the data are sufficient for carbon cycle model simulations from 1801 to 2010. These data were compiled specifically for the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Multi-Scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) as the prescribed model input driver data (Huntzinger et al., 2013). The driver data were used by 22 terrestrial biosphere models to run baseline and sensitivity simulations. The standardized data provided consistent model inputs to minimize the inter-model variability caused by differences in environmental drivers and initial conditions. Together with the sensitivity simulations, the standardized input data enable better interpretation and quantification of structural and parameter uncertainties of model estimates. Data are provided in Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata convention compliant (version 1.4) netCDF-4 file formats. There are 3,152 *.nc4 data files with this data set.* [NACP Regional: National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Aggregated Gridded Model Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gyxx-yj86) - This data set provides two products that were derived from the recently published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis 1-degree terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs (Gridded 1-deg Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et al., 2013). The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional Synthesis - Description of Observations and Models.* [Improved Lyman-Ultraviolet Astronomy Capabilities through Enhanced Coatings](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ynez-36jj) - <p>The &nbsp;Large Ultraviolet ,Visible, Optical, Infrared (LUVOIR) telescope concept is one of the &nbsp;NASA mission concept studies for&nbsp;the 2020 decadal study that will merge&nbsp;ultraviolet (UV) astrophysics and visible exoplanet science. This proposal aims at developing broadband reflecting mirror coatings with high performance that could&nbsp;be used on the primiary mirror of LUVOIR in order to enable wavelength coverage from the infrared and down to the Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) spectral regions.&nbsp;Improved reflective coatings for optics, particularly in the FUV region (90-120 nm), could yield dramatically more sensitive instruments and permit more instrument design freedom.&nbsp;The coating performance developed through this work will be evaluated both theoretically and experimentally in the context of meeting requirements for exoplanet research.</p><p>Pure Aluminum exhibits a high reflectance over the proposed spectral range of the LUVOIR observatory (90-5000 nm). However, the Al has to be protected from the naturally occurring Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> oxide layer (when exposed to oxygen) with a thin film of a transparent material for use below 130 nm. Aluminum protected with fluorides such as LiF or MgF<sub>2</sub> have been the most commonly used solutions [4]. But below 102 nm down to 90 nm, no transparent material is available to protect Al and coating mirror reflectance stays well below 30%. But even above 102 nm, the reflectance of protected Al is limited by the residual absorption of the fluoride overcoats and the hygroscopic nature of the LiF overcoat.&nbsp; The low reflectivity of coatings in the Lyman Ultraviolet (LUV) range of 90-130 nm is one of the biggest constraints on FUV telescope and spectrograph design, and it limits the science return of FUV-sensitive space missions. In fact, to achieve high-reflectance in broadband coatings has been identified as an &ldquo;Essential Goal&rdquo; in the technology needs for the LUVOIR) surveyor observatory. Improved reflective coatings for optics, particularly in the LUV spectrum, could yield dramatically more sensitive instruments and permit more instrument design freedom. Furthermore, investigations in improving reflectance performance of coatings in this region has the potential to offer unprecedented return on investment given that the LUV contains the highest density of line observations in the UVVIS-IR spectrum.&nbsp;</p>* [Advanced Manufacturing Technologies for Miniaturized Instruments](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w4nu-n7wz) - <p>We will design and construct miniaturized instruments ideal for CubeSat/SmallSat and other planetary missions that are optimized for throughput while addressing fundamental limitations of miniaturization of instruments that are imposed by precision and fastener issues.&nbsp;</p>* [Habitat Particle Impact Monitoring System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jze4-mhd4) - <p>The purpose of this project is the development of particle impact detection technology for application to habitable space exploration modules, both in space and on the surfaces of Solar System bodies. This mission-enabling technology will be needed to improve the safety of future human exploration missions. Inflatable space structures have unique characteristics that would benefit from an instrument system for detecting impact penetrations and reporting the extent of these penetrations, as well as their size and location.  Building on previous experience, (i.e. the Habitat Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) hardware and software, which was developed for the Habitat Demonstration Unit) a system particularly adapted to the multilayer inflatable space structures can be developed.   The HIMS sensors represent a class of sensors that are both low mass, simply emplaced, and require little power or system resources.  This sensor system was applied to test sample coupons, representative of inflatable structures, modified as required, and subjected to hypervelocity impacts. Results of these tests allowed system verification for this type of space structure, with the ultimate goal to achieve an automatic impact location and characterization system for the inflatable space structure.<p/><p>The goal of the Habitat particle Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) is to develop a fully automated, end-to-end particle impact detection system for crewed space exploration modules, both in space and on planetary surfaces.  When micrometeoroids or orbital debris impacts occur on a space habitat, crew members need to be quickly informed of the likely extent of damage, and then take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the mission. HIMS uses multiple thin film piezo-polymer vibration sensors to detect impacts on a surface and characterize the impact locations and degree of penetration.  Installation of the HIMS sensors is easy, and does not require any major reconfiguration of the habitat structure. The detection capabilities of HIMS on a hard-shell structure were successfully demonstrated on the Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) Pressurized Excursion Module (PEM) during the 2010-2011 Desert Research and Technology Studies campaign. The main objective for the project in FY12 was to explore the feasibility of using HIMS for particle impact detection on multi-layer inflatable structures and determine optimum sensor configuration requirements for potential applications on future inflatable habitats. Hypervelocity impact tests were performed on a test article consisting of a spherical rubber bladder inflated within a Kevlar envelope "restraint layer". The tests showed that the system detects the impact in both the Kevlar layer and the rubber bladder.  The ring-down acoustic response of the simplified target indicates a signal detection range of at least 3 m from the point of impact.  It is hypothesized that an actual inflatable structure, with higher stiffness and thicker walls, would propagate the acoustical signals with less loss. Thus the system design and sensor configuration for inflatable structures is expected to be similar to designs and configurations already tested on rigid structures.</p>* [Graphene Field Effect Transistors for Radiation Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fwcs-3623) - <p>This is  propose to develop Graphene Field Effect Transistor based Radiation Sensors (GFET-RS) for NASA Manned Spaceflight Missions anticipated in next several decades.<p/><p>The device consists of a graphene piece deposited on a Si substrate with certain thickness of insulation layer. In our initial experiment, constant radiation was applied above the GFET and device conductance was measured before and after the radiation. We observed an increase of the device mobility (transconductance) after the radiation. This demonstration showed that graphene is radiation hard and its conductance changes with radiation. With the IRAD fund, we will continue exploring sensing mechanisms in GFETs and identify optimal absorber substrates and device geometries to improve radiation detection speed, sensitivity, and energy resolution of our GFET-RS devices.</p>* [Accelerating Memory-Access-Limited HPC Applications via Novel Fast Data Compression, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gi56-xesv) - A fast-paced continual increase on the ratio of CPU to memory speed feeds an exponentially growing limitation for extracting performance from HPC systems. Breaking this memory wall is one of the most important challenges that the HPC community faces today. In Phase I we introduced aggressive innovations enable the injection of unprecedented acceleration into vast classes of memory-access-bound HPC codes via ultra-fast software-based data compression. Groundbreaking speedup on a fully functional NPBCG prototype was delivered to NASA, thus validating the tremendous potential of our approach. The proposed approach is based on a revolutionary theory of compression spearheaded by Accelogic (Compressive Computing), which is able to provide enormous compressive gains for the typical floating point data of HPC applications. 
In Phase II we will build on our success with the NPBCG benchmark, and move boldly into tackling the acceleration of a real-life high-profile code, namely NASA's Cart3D, improving its performance by a paradigm-shifting 2x to 4x end-to-end wall-clock time acceleration by the end of Phase II. Our firm has accumulated crucial know-how and has synthesized its expertise into a powerful industrial-quality process for software acceleration that will be used to ensure success on completing Phase II objectives. In Phase II we also plan on injecting a second NASA code with basic Compressive Computing techniques, and providing it with base levels of acceleration of ~1.3-2x. We will choose this second code from a pool of high-profile codes that have already signed up as early adopters for this project: FUN3D, USM3D, Enzo, and WRF. The work on a second NASA code will also serve as the ultimate field test of the broadness and ease-of-infusion of the proposed technology.
We have secured complementary funds in the amount of $500,000 to increase resources and ensure that the proposed Phase II proposed will be successfully accomplished.* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/45wt-h3qq) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. (2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This data set is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [SAFARI 2000 Daily Rainfall Estimates, 0.1-Deg, Southern Africa, 1993-2001](https://data.nasa.gov/d/46m8-5peb) - The Microwave InfraRed Algorithm (MIRA) is used to produce an imagery data set of daily mean rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution over southern Africa for the period 1993-2001. MIRA combines passive microwave (PMW) from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) on board the DMSP F10 and F14 satellites at a resolution of 0.5 degrees and infrared (IR) data from the Meteosat 4, 5, 6, and 7 satellites in 2-hour slots at a resolution of 5 km. This approach accounts for the limitations of both data types in estimating precipitation. Rainfall estimates are produced at the high spatial and temporal frequency of the IR data using rainfall information from the PMW data. An IR/rain rate relationship, variable in space and time, is derived from coincident observations of IR and PMW rain rate (accumulated over a calibration domain) using the probability matching method. The IR/rain rate relationship is then applied to IR imagery at full temporal resolution. The results presented here are the daily means of those derived rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution.The rainfall data sets are flat binary images with no headers. They are compressed band sequential (bsq) files that contain all of the daily images for the given year. Each image is an array of 401 lines, each with 341 binary floating-point numbers, containing rainfall at 0.1 degree resolution for the area 10 to 50 degrees longitude and 0 to -34 degrees latitude.

This approach accounts for the limitations of both data types in estimating precipitation. Rainfall estimates are produced at the high spatial and temporal frequency of the IR data using rainfall information from the PMW data. An IR/rain rate relationship, variable in space and time, is derived from coincident observations of IR and PMW rain rate (accumulated over a calibration domain) using the probability matching method. The IR/rain rate relationship is then applied to IR imagery at full temporal resolution. The results presented here are the daily means of those derived rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution.The rainfall data sets are flat binary images with no headers. They are compressed band sequential (bsq) files that contain all of the daily images for the given year. Each image is an array of 401 lines, each with 341 binary floating-point numbers, containing rainfall at 0.1 degree resolution for the area 10 to 50 degrees longitude and 0 to -34 degrees latitude. The number of band sequential images in each annual file and the associated dates can be found in the file MIRA_data_dates.csv.* [SAFARI 2000 LAI and FPAR Measurements at Sua Pan, Botswana, Dry Season 2000](https://data.nasa.gov/d/is2t-2ifb) - ABSTRACT: The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Validation team was deployed to the Sua Pan salt playa in the Magkadigkadi region of Botswana during the SAFARI 2000 Dry Season Aircraft Campaign to collect various data sets for validating the MISR LAI/FPAR algorithm. Ground measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) were made using the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer and Sunfleck PAR ceptometer, respectively, during focused periods from August 20 to August 28, 2000 at a dry grassland site adjacent to the Sua Pan. The 1 km by 1 km sampling grid was a homogeneous, relatively dense grassland, with a height of 20-100 cm and two prevalent grass types, Odyssea paucinervis and Sporobolus spicatus. Associated reflectance measurements were made with the PARABOLA and ASD instruments (Helmlinger et al., 2004a; 2004b).The data files contain measurements of LAI and PAR reflectance and transmission and a description of sky conditions during the sampling periods. With one exception, all measurements were made under clear sky conditions.  PAR data were measured only on the transect scale while LAI are provided at both pixel and transect scales. PAR readings were performed at 93 transect sample points, and LAI readings were performed at 135 (93 transect and 42 subgrid) sample points. Each file also contains mean LAI and PAR values. The data files are ASCII tables, in comma-separated-value format.* [Next Generation Microshutter Arrays Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f85i-p44p) - We propose to develop the next generation MicroShutter Array (MSA) as a multi-object field selector for missions anticipated in the next two decades. For many applications, this field selector improves instrument efficiency proportionally to the number of shutters opened simultaneously. We have successfully developed and built the JWST microshutter array system, which increases the observing efficiency of the Near Infrared Spectrometer by two orders of magnitude. As a result of this development, there is a significant scientific demand for these devices for space-based and ground based applications. The availability of large format microshutters can significantly increase the scientific reach of spectroscopic survey instrument such as WFIRST and future missions such as ATLAST. The basic design of the JWST MSA cannot be extended to such a large scales due to the design limitations set by the required magnetic actuation. We have recently demonstrated shutter operation using DC plus AC resonant pumping. The breakthrough demonstrates that we are able to eliminate bulky permanent magnets used for JWST MSA actuation, thus opening an avenue to create a very large focal plane field selector that can be built at much lower cost. in this program, we will fabricate electrostatically actuated microshutter arrays and demonstrate their performance for use as UV, visible, and infrared field selectors.* [MOPITT CO gridded daily means (Near and Thermal Infrared Radiances) V007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u82y-6yzg) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals.

Active fire data for AVHRR/NOAA-12 was produced using a fixed threshold fire detection technique based on the algorithm developed by the Centro de Previsao do Tempo e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC/INPE) (Setzer and Pereira, 1991; Setzer et al., 1994; Setzer and Malingreau, 1996). Active fire data for MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua was produced using a contextual fire detection technique based on NASA-University of Maryland algorithm (Justice et al., 2003; Giglio et al.2003).Resulting fire counts were compared for major biomes of Brazil (Figure 1), the nine states of the Legal Amazon (e.g., Tocantins, Figure 2), and two important road corridors in the Amazon region (Figure 3). In evaluating the daily fire counts, there is a dependence on variations in satellite viewing geometry, overpass time, atmospheric conditions, and fire characteristics (Schroeder et al., 2005).

Three approaches are combined to develop a system that will meet current and future NASA needs and exceed currently available power processor unit (PPU) performance in terms of electrical efficiency, specific mass (kg/kW), and cost.   The approaches include the use of (a) high-efficiency, 3-phase, dc-dc converters to minimize cooling requirements, mass, and parts count and maximize reliability and efficiency, (b) modularized and standardized sub-system design and fabrication techniques to accommodate power output scaling and re-configuration for specific ion thruster designs without the need to re-qualify hardware, and (c) attention to cost and manufacturability issues that will allow the implementation of electric propulsion systems on future NASA missions without the hidden costs of "hard-to-build" and "hard-to-scale" designs that are currently available.   The innovations proposed herein will allow NASA to obtain the flexibility and performance it needs in power processors for electric propulsion systems while ensuring that their cost and difficulty of fabrication is low.* [Thermal Protection Systems Nondestructive Evaluation Tool, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7k4c-6uue) - Based on the successful feasibility demonstration in Phase I, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to continue the development of a novel Thermal Protection System Nondestructive Evaluation Tool (THRON), which addresses NASA's need for evaluation of lightweight rigid and/or flexible ablative materials, and provides noncontact, one-sided in situ operation for accurate detection, identification, and precise spatial localization and measurements of internal and surface defects/voids, and evaluation of bondlines and in-depth integrity of such materials and also large-area multilayer thermal protection system (TPS) structures with complex geometries. THRON is based on POC-patented X-ray Compton imaging tomography and POC-patented apodized coded aperture X-ray imaging optics, substantially modified and optimized to meet NASA's requirements. The THRON Phase I prototype demonstrated excellent potential for detection and spatial localization of defects/voids with dimensions <6 mm by 6 mm by 6 mm, and bondline defects <12 mm by 12 mm by 200 &#956;m in TPS material and structures.

The initial submission from IKI by Dyachkov was in GROUP FITS (binary) for the 'imaging channel'. A separate submission came through the IHW Infrared Studies Discipline and also contained data presented in the FITS format (IHW keywords) for the two 'infrared channels'. In the former case, the three Pvalues carried information on the distance and two angles used to locate the position of the comet on the slit. The other simple keyword values marked only the date, mission, and experiment. The latter data, had not only 101 individual spectra for the 3-5 micron measurements but a composite 'final' 6-12 micron spectrum with associated 'figure 7' from the published results (COMBES, M. et al. 1988, Icarus, 76, 404). For these 101 spectra a cometo-centric distance was quoted rather than a time micron data. Using this information, the distance range was 270534.9 to 39273.22 km. From this comparison, it is inferred that the distance quoted in the IKI submission is also cometo-centric (31596.0 to 16092 km).* [Use of NDE Techniques for Compliance Verification of Suspect Counterfeit EEE Parts](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cz6c-tcsd) - <p>Genuine microelectronics components are critical to NASA for Human Rating Requirement (HRR) for Manned Follow-On Vehicles and for planetary missions.&nbsp; Counterfeited electrical components could cause failure resulting in loss of mission or, in the case of manned missions, loss of life.&nbsp; There exists a wide variation of fraudulent/counterfeit electronic components due to the various types of components and their packaging construction.&nbsp; Currently, there exists no single standard inspection test to detect suspect fraudulent/counterfeit parts or to verify component integrity.&nbsp;This task&nbsp;identifies and/or develops nondestructive evaluation methods that can be used by NASA Centers and their suppliers to mitigate the risk of fraudulent/counterfeit electronic parts.&nbsp; The methods will first be implemented by the distributor or their test provider or during the incoming receiving inspection process at the Center.&nbsp; In addition, the methods will be used as a control of in-process (post acceptance) and in-service investigations of suspect fraudulent/counterfeit parts.&nbsp; This will purge NASA hardware of such non-conforming parts and thus increase safety and mission success.</p> <p><strong>Specific inspection issue being addressed and history of inspection problems.</strong><br />Genuine microelectronics components are critical to NASA for Human Rating Requirement (HRR) for Manned Follow-On Vehicles and for planetary missions.&nbsp; Counterfeited electrical components could cause failure resulting in loss of mission or, in the case of manned missions, loss of life.&nbsp; There exists a wide variation of fraudulent/counterfeit electronic components due to the various types of components and their packaging construction.&nbsp; The following examples of suspect counterfeit electronic components in recent Government-Industry Data Exchange Program reports demonstrate this variety:</p><p>Currently, there exists no single standard inspection test to detect suspect fraudulent/counterfeit parts or to verify component integrity.&nbsp; Although loosely used, this process is not called authentication because the term &quot;authentication&quot; is reserved for a process conducted by the original component manufacturer.&nbsp; The original component manufacturer owns the intellectual property and the original test hardware and software used in the original manufacturing of the component.&nbsp; However, once the parts enter the supply chain, the manufacturer will never retest the parts.&nbsp; Testing conducted by distributors or by independent third party test service providers is called &quot;product verification&quot;.&nbsp; Industry product verification in the supply chain must then be conducted as a series of nondestructive and destructive tests because counterfeiters of electronic parts continue to evolve their methods to mask evidence of remarking or resurfacing.&nbsp; Most recent counterfeiters are now assembling used parts, with unknown history and reliability issues, into new packages that have no evidence or remarking or resurfacing.&nbsp; These practices force the user or test service providers to continually upgrade product verification methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Details on how completion of this task will increase safety and mission assurance.</strong><br />It is the intention of this task to identify and/or develop nondestructive evaluation methods that can be used by NASA Centers and their suppliers to mitigate the risk of fraudulent/counterfeit electronic parts.&nbsp; The methods will first be implemented by the distributor or their test provider or during the incoming receiving inspection process at the Center.&nbsp; In addition, the methods will be used as a control of in-process (post acceptance) and in-service investigations of suspect fraudulent/counterfeit parts.&nbsp; This will purge NASA hardware of such non-conforming parts and thus increase safety and mission success.</p><p>Details* [Innovative Development of Kernel-Based Reduced-Order Models for Predicting LCO Onset, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g8i2-i62i) - Reducing uncertainty in the prediction of limit cycle oscillations (LCO) and other nonlinear aeroservoelastic phenomena is critical to flight safety.  To do so requires nonlinear methods.  First-principles based methods (CFD/CSD) have made considerable progress but still cannot predict LCO from the outset.  NEAR proposes the development of two innovative nonlinear data-based methods to characterize aeroservoelastic systems using flight-test data.  The proposed methods provide a natural extension of existing linear methods, provide uncertainty estimates of the prediction, and are applicable to flight-test data.  Both approaches are formally related.  However, their practical implementations place various limitations on the physics they represent.  The Phase I effort will document, on a benchmark test case, the advantages and disadvantages of each method.  Phase II will further develop the most promising approach and demonstrate its use on flight-test data, such as data from the F18-AAW.  Special emphasis will be placed on the problem of data generalization across flight conditions, which is key to ensuring safe and efficient envelope-expansion flight testing.* [The Case for Software Health Management](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a5ij-6vyn) - Software Health Management (SWHM) is a new field that is concerned with the development of tools and technologies to enable automated detection, diagnosis, prediction, and mitigation of adverse events due to software anomalies.
Significant effort has been expended in the last several decades in the
development of verification and validation methods for software
intensive systems, but it is becoming increasingly more apparent that this is
not enough to guarantee that a complex software system
meets all safety and reliability requirements. 

Modern software systems can exhibit a variety of failure modes which can go undetected in a verification and validation process.  While standard techniques for error handling, fault detection and isolation
can have significant benefits for many systems, it is becoming increasingly evident that new technologies and methods are necessary for the development of techniques to detect, diagnose, predict, and then mitigate the adverse events due to software that has already undergone significant verification and validation procedures.
These software faults often arise due to the interaction between the software
and the operating environment.
Unanticipated environmental changes lead to software anomalies that may have significant impact on the overall success of the mission.
Because software is ubiquitous, it is not sufficient that errors are
detected only after they occur. Rather, software must be instrumented and
monitored for failures before they happen.
This prognostic capability will yield safer and more dependable systems for the future.  This paper addresses the motivation, needs, and requirements of software health management as a new discipline.

It is not just a matter of stereo being better than 2D, but of stereo being necessary to interpret representations of complex data sets, physical phenomena, engineering designs and position in space.  The US Air Force has long recognized the potential for 3D displays in the cockpit but until now the limitations of 3D display technology have prevented implementation.  Interest in 3D image display has recently surfaced among SPAWAR and among agencies who use helicopters and firms that make camera systems for helicopters for use in power line inspection, law enforcement, and military applications. There is also interest in the use of plane mounted cameras in collision avoidance while taxiing on runways, where 3D display may be of benefit because it can show the pilot how much room there is between the plane and obstacles. 3D displays for these applications must be of the glasses free type, but current embodiments of such displays possess extremely low resolution, produce visual artifacts, and tend to produce very narrow viewing areas.  Under a recent DOE SBIR Phase II contract DTI developed a new glasses free 2D/3D switchable display that avoids the resolution loss, visual artifacts, and viewing restrictions associated with all other autostereoscopic displays, providing full HD resolution in 3D as well as in a 2D viewing mode.  DTI's believes that this new technology can lead to the first practical implementation of a 3D display in the cockpit. During this Phase I program DTI will investigate the adaptation of its 2D/3D displays to cockpit displays through compact design, ruggedizing, and the development of mechanical, electronic, computer, and software interfaces to an aircraft system.  This investigation will lead to a high level design and specification for a prototype display that can developed in Phase II and delivered for testing in a cockpit or simulator.* [PowerCube: Integrated Power, Propulsion, and Pointing for CubeSats, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cs23-8in8) - The PowerCube is a 1U CubeSat module that provides integrated propulsion, power, and precision pointing to enable the low-cost CubeSat platform to be used to conduct high-performance missions. The PowerCube concept integrates three innovative component technologies to provide these capabilities:  First, a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) water-electrolysis fuel cell supplies gH2/gO2 to a simple pressure-fed thruster to provide 300 Ns of impulse per 100 mL of water. This approach enables the CubeSat to launch with 'inert' propellant to comply with P-POD limitations on stored energy and then process the water on-orbit into high-Isp fuel. Second, a deployable solar array that stows along the long sides of the CubeSat and deploys in a 'windmill' configuration provides up to 96 W peak. Third, a 3DOF 'carpal-wrist' gimbal, in conjunction with magnetic torque coils, enables sun-tracking of the solar panel, vectoring of the thruster, and precision pointing of payloads. The combination of ample power and water electrolysis will provide up to 6 m/s of delta-V per 90 minute orbit for a 3U CubeSat. Compared to other CubeSat propulsion technologies, the PowerCube thruster will enable more rapid orbital maneuvering and significantly lower contamination issues.  Our Phase I effort developed a detailed baseline design for the PowerCube, and built and tested a proof-of-concept prototype of the water-electrolysis thruster.  The Phase II effort will mature the electrolysis thruster component to the engineering model level, develop and simulate methods for attitude control and precise pointing of both panels and payloads using the gimbal and torque coils, and develop a detailed design for the entire PowerCube module to enable flight validation in follow-on Phase III efforts.* [A Novel Low-cost, Ka-band, High Altitude, Multi-Baseline Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Sensor for Surface Water Ocean Topography, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mmea-gshd) - This proposal presents the Ka-band SWOT Phenomenology Airborne Radar (KaSPAR) to support the surface water ocean topography (SWOT) mission for science and algorithm development and calibration and validation.

The concept of Cryogenic Hydrogen Radiation Shielding (CHRS) was studied by&nbsp;Cryogenic Branch at NASA GSFC&nbsp;with a FY08 IRAD. This IRAD project will complete a preliminary thermal and ground cooling system design of the CHRS system and also perform a radiation transmission test with potential CHRS tank materials.</p> <p>The objectives of this IRAD study are to perform the preliminary thermal system design and optimization of the CHRS system and to perform radiation testings of samples of materials that are candidates for containing the hydrogen in the CHRS.</p><p>The previous study of the concept proposed a potential CHRS geometry. We can meet the thermal design&nbsp;requirements by using proper cryogenic thermal management techniques. Various design&nbsp;options will be investigated for the fluid management system. The fluid management system will provide the required fluid distribution in the tank, and suppress the formation of large gas bubbles. We will use a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis tool ANSYS FLUENT&reg; to analyze and optimize the performance of the fluid management system.</p><p>In addition to the work above, the tank materials will be selected based on the thermal performance. The radiation test for these materials will be carried out at NASA Center for Radiation Engineering and Science for Space Exploration (CRESSE).</p><p>This FY 2014 IRAD study will increase the CHRS TRL level to 2. The design will prove the concept and increase the feasibility of the CHRS system. &nbsp;The output from this study can be used to pursue research opportunities for the radiation shielding at NASA&rsquo;s Human Research Program (HRP).</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Justification</strong></p><p>Human susceptibility to the harsh space radiation environment has been identified as being a major hurdle for exploration beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). High energy protons and nuclei ions from Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) can result in radiation doses that are dangerous to astronaut health and even survivability if the astronauts are not adequately shielded. The high energy particles also cause significant amounts of secondary radiation when they impinge on Aluminum, which is commonly used for spacecraft structure. The secondary neutron radiation may cause human radiogenic cancers.

ANITA seeks to detect and elucidate the sources of the highest energy particles in the universe via measurements of cosmogenic ultra-high energy neutrinos at energies above 1EeV (1EeV=10^18 eV). Such neutrinos are in many cases predicted to be the only unattenuated astrophysical messengers that arrive at Earth with precise directional information, since neutrinos are neutral particles with very weak interactions with matter in intergalactic space. Neutrinos that ANITA seeks to detect will signal the presence of the most extreme astrophysical accelerators and environments, and complement the information available via electromagnetic messengers from gamma-rays to radio waves. 

ANITA uses a long-duration balloon payload equipped with 48 dual-polarization horn antennas to detect radio impulses in the frequency range 200-1200 MHz, within which the properties of cold Antarctic ice include extreme radio-transparency and depths of up to 4 km. If a neutrino interacts anywhere within the ice sheet in ANITA's view from stratospheric altitudes, we can detect the emerging radio impulse and determine its direction and other characteristics with high precision. This in turn allows us to select candidate neutrinos from among the thermal and anthropogenic backgrounds with high confidence, and to derive angular information about the arrival direction of such candidates as well.

Recently ANITA analysis investigated a new detection channel, which focuses on tau-lepton-generating neutrinos, which lead to a unique experimental signature for which ANITA has potentially very high sensitivity, and a candidate event has been detected in prior data. This new detection channel has added to the variety of methods by which ANITA continues to improve its sensitivity and reach into predicted models for cosmogenic neutrinos, for which ANITA has among the best constraints of any detector to date.

ANITA is currently the only active NASA mission with the capability to measure ultra-high energy neutrinos, and ANITA's ultra-high energy neutrino sensitivity while in flight is unmatched by any other instrument, ground- or space-based. As such it is a direct contributor to our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe, through astrophysical messengers that provide unique information about the most extreme and energetic objects in the cosmos.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_realtime](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i568-8mpe) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data.

However, sensors continue to be considered the weak link in many engineering applications since often they are less reli- able than the system they are observing. This is in part due to the sensors’ operating principles and their susceptibility to interference from the environment. Detecting and mitigating sensor failure modes are becoming increasingly important in more complex and safety-critical applications. This paper reports on different techniques for sensor fault detection, disambiguation, and mitigation. It presents an expert system that uses a combination of object-oriented modeling, rules, and semantic networks to deal with the most common sensor faults, such as bias, drift, scaling, and dropout, as well as system faults. The paper also describes a sensor correction module that is based on fault parameters extraction (for bias, drift, and scaling fault modes) as well as utilizing partial redundancy for dropout sensor fault modes). The knowledge-based system was derived from the results obtained in a previously deployed Neural Network (NN) application for fault detection and disambiguation. Results are illustrated on an electromechanical actuator application where the system faults are jam and spalling. In addition to the functions implemented in the previous work, system fault detection under sensor failure was also modeled. The paper includes a sensitivity analysis that compares the results previously obtained with the NN. It concludes with a discussion of similarities and differences between the two approaches and how the knowledge based system provides additional functionality compared to the NN implementation.* [Perovskite-based Photovoltaics: A New Pathway to Ultra- Low-Cost Space Power](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ja3w-xvxg) - We will determine if the lifetime performance of new perovskite-based solar cells can be engineered for long-term performance for space applications.  We will utilize cutting-edge designs for long lifetime, engineer our own samples, and characterize performance throughout standardized lifetime testing appropriate for space technology. 

Thin film solar cells have long held promise as enabling technology for flexible arrays and radiation hardness. The meteoric efficiency rise (reaching 22%1) for new solar cells in the “perovskite” structure family – from now on referred to simply as perovskites2 – represent an exceedingly attractive option for potential space applications. We envision this technology to enable the ubiquity of low-cost smallsats and CubeSats that can be utilized for power-hungry, high fidelity experiments and measurements. Mass production and automated assembly of these systems helps bring down cost and standardizes launch requirements. Additional applications include autonomous, roll-out solar arrays for extra-terrestrial surface deployments.  In these two visions the current state of the art is disrupted by the thin, flexibility of perovskites, their ease of fabrication and high efficiency. 

The goal is  to transfer the perovskite solar cells from research laboratory curiosity to potential game-changing, space qualified technology.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Rapid Clock Product (30 second resolution, daily files, generated daily) from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/759d-57q8) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Rapid Satellite and Receiver Clock Product (30-second granularity, daily files, generated daily) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce GNSS satellite and ground receiver clock values. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS rapid combined satellite and receiver clock products. The rapid combination is a daily solution available approximately 17 hours after the end of the previous UTC day. All satellite and receiver clock solution files utilize the clock RINEX format and span 24 hours from 00:00 to 23:45 UTC. For most applications the user of IGS products will not notice any significant differences between results obtained using the IGS Final and the IGS Rapid products.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Final Earth Rotation Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j2qa-av9d) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Final Earth Rotation Product (ERP) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS ultra-rapid combined orbit products. The ultra-rapid orbit and clock combination is a sub-daily solution, released four times per day, at 03:00, 09:00, 15:00, and 21:00 UTC (prior to GPS week 1267 they were released twice daily). In this way the average age of the predictions is reduced to 6 hours (compared to 36 hours for the old IGS predicted products and 9 hours for the twice-daily ultra-rapid solutions). IGS ultra-rapid orbit files contain 48 hours of tabulated orbital ephemerides, and the start/stop epochs continuously shift by 6 hours with each update. The first 24 hours of each IGS ultra-rapid orbit are based on the most recent GNSS observational data from the IGS hourly tracking network. At the time of release, the observed orbits have an initial latency of 3 hours. The next 24 hours of each file are predicted orbits, extrapolated from the observed orbits. The orbits within each ultra-rapid product file are, however, continuous at the boundary between the observed and predicted parts. Normally, the predicted orbits between 3 and 9 hours into the second half of each ultra-rapid orbit file are most relevant for true real time applications. All orbit solution files utilize the extended standard product-3 (SP3c) format. The reduced latency on availability of these products allows for significantly improved orbit predictions and reduced errors for user applications.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Ultra-Rapid Orbit/Clock/ERP Product Summary from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qhxj-6gm5) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Rapid Orbit/Reference Frame Product Summary from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as collateral damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass high charge and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs) but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5-24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response although they differ slightly in the timing degree and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the  xd2DSB response xd3 were also induced by other DNA damaging agents but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced at 24 h post-irradiation ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast only HZE-irradiated plants at 1.5 h after irradiation exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response shared with plants experiencing extended night. This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants. We treated 5-day-old WT and atm-1 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana with 100 Gy of Gamma radiation (over a span of 15 minutes) or 30 Gy of HZE (over a span of approximately 12 minutes). Gamma irradiations were completed at 8:40 am while HZE irradiations were conducted in two runs (due to space limitations) which were completed at 1:09 and 1:28pm respectively. Gamma treated seedlings were sampled at 10:10 am 11:40 am 2:55 pm 8:40 pm and 8:40 am. HZE treated seedlings were sampled at 2:39 pm 4:09 pm 7:24 pm 1:09 am and 1:09 pm. Un-irradiated WT and atm-1 control seedlings were sampled at 10:45 am on Day #1 and 9:15 am on Day #2. There are a total of 22 experimental or control conditions with two replicates per condition yielding 44 samples overall.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_final](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tetj-ga5h) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data.

To better plan this mission and create a robust optimized balloon design, NASA requires the ability to more accurately evaluate the convective heat transfer characteristics of the balloon operating in Titan's atmosphere.  Based on limitations of previous efforts, NASA has requested proposals for a testbed to support CFD validation.  Leveraging the results of the Phase I effort, Near Space Corporation (NSC), proposes to develop and operate two full scale Testbeds (~9 m diameter) in order to help validate CFD models for the TSSM Titan Montgolfiere balloon.  The Testbeds will incorporate new envelope design innovations and state-of-the-art data acquisition methods to enable data intensive tethered and free-flight tests.  Utilizing its unique balloon facility located in a large blimp hangar, NSC will conduct iterative tethered hangar tests of the full scale Testbeds (which is not possible in existing cryogenic test chambers). These flights will enable better IR imaging and flow characterization measurements.  The acquired data will provide critical input to incrementally improve and validate the CFD models.  The outdoor drop/inflation test and a free flight test will retire technology risks associated with the future Titan mission in addition to generating the validation data necessary to improve the existing CFD models.  NSC proposes to develop and operate a mature TMTT system during Phase II, generate pertinent data that will be used to improve the CFD models, and leverage the effort to create valuable technology with both NASA and non-NASA commercial applications.* [MOPITT CO gridded monthly means (Thermal Infrared Radiances) V007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s9qp-3y8i) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals.

The threat of onboard fire is constant and requires early, fast and unfailing detection.  Current fire detectors are prone to fatigue and have insufficient sensitivity, selectivity and time-response.  Smoke detectors cannot detect early stages of combustion and become unreliable if exposed to dust particulates.  New sensor technology is required to face the challenging tasks associated with future space exploration involving missions to the Moon and Mars.  Carbon monoxide formation is a reliable indicator of evolving fire threats onboard spacecraft and this gaseous combustion product allows rapid early detection.  Vista Photonics proposes to evaluate and implement emerging infrared light sources for high-performance optical CO detection.  Optical sensors are particularly favorable due to unique features like fast response, high precision and strong species selectivity.  Design criteria such as small footprint, low weight, low power consumption as well as internal calibration and continuous sensor health monitoring will be implemented to provide a spaceflight optimized sensor.

Electrical and/or optical transponders operating with Space Wire, Fire Wire, or Gigabit Ethernet protocols are required to support the associated data interconnects. The systems must be easily upgradeable, power-efficient, fault-tolerant, EMI-protected, and capable to operate effectively for long periods of time in harsh environmental conditions including radiation effects. To address the described needs, Advanced Science and Novel Technology Company proposes to develop a basic concept of the novel, optical, radiation-tolerant transponder, which will be implemented as a hermetically-sealed pigtailed multi-chip module with an FPGA-friendly parallel interface and will feature an improved radiation tolerance, high data rate, low power consumption, and advanced functionality. The transponder will utilize the company's patent-pending current-mode logic library of radiation-hardened-by-architecture cells. 8B10B encoding will be used to achieve data disparity equal to 0 and perform a reliable clock recovery. The encoder and decoder will utilize the company's patented half-rate architecture that improves radiation tolerance. The proposed characteristics will be achieved by utilization of an advanced SiGe BiCMOS technology.* [Advanced Materials for Safe, High Performance Space-Rated Lithium-Ion Batteries, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qqhv-7dvd) - NASA space exploration vehicles are trending to higher pulse power, energy capacity levels and cycle life in order to meet exponentially increasing performance and lifespan requirements. As the demand for on-board power and total energy-storage capacity has continued to increase, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of battery technologies with higher energy- and power-density potential. Although substantial advancements have been made in this class of batteries over the past ten years by both domestic and foreign suppliers, substantial limitations still exist in: energy and power densities, operational temperature limits, safety, and lifecycle and lifetime performance.  To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc. proposes the use of advanced nanocomoposite electrodes and ionic liquid electrolytes to enable increased performance and safety in lithium-ion batteries as compared to state-of-the-art devices.  The high capacity, high rate capability and high cycle life performance potential of the proposed advanced nanocomposite electrodes in combination with the inherent non-volatility and non-flammability of ionic liquids holds substantial potential in meeting this objective.  This proposed project will result in improved specific energy and power, wider operation temperature ranges, inherently safer operation, and excellent storage / cycle life as compared to current Li-ion batteries.* [SPHERES Autonomy and Identification Testbed, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8w4m-gg9c) - Many future space missions involve formation flying spacecraft performing imaging, inspection, assembly, and servicing missions.  Having multiple spacecraft in close proximity undergoing comparatively rapid maneuvers dramatically changes the nature of safe modes.  No longer can a spacecraft just null its rates, point its arrays towards the Sun and phone home.  Now, the faulty spacecraft must also ensure that it will not collide with others.  Furthermore, it must plan its maneuvers such that if it does experience a fault, the likelihood of collision is minimized.  Fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) is more complex and requires a vigilant on-board software watchdog that reacts to both intra-vehicle as well as inter-vehicle faults and plans according to the consequences. Payload Systems Inc. (PSI), along with it partners at MIT and Intellization, propose an Autonomy and Identification Testbed (SPHERES-AIT) based on the SPHERES platform.  SPHERES is a multi-satellite docking laboratory to mature metrology, autonomy, and path-planning algorithms for AR&D in the risk-tolerant yet long duration micro-gravity inside the International Space Station (ISS). This work will mature a modular autonomy software architecture that supports  on-orbit self-assembly and spacecraft formation flight using a coordinated terrestrial and ISS laboratory that supports spiral development.* [Novel Wick Structures for Improved Heat Pipe Performance, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rsuh-hkmd) - Heat pipes are commonly used for transporting heat over relatively long distances with very low temperature drop.  One of the limitations of heat pipes is the capillary limit, which states that the sum of pressure drops of the working fluid cannot exceed the capillary head developed by the wick.  Since most of the working fluid pressure drop is incurred in flow through the wick, it is important to reduce the wick resistance as much as possible while still being able to transport the required thermal load. 
All heat pipes made today have the same wick throughout the heat pipe.  This facilitates manufacture, however it causes a great deal more resistance to liquid flow than is minimally required.  By breaking the wick up into several different regions in which the wick properties are different, a more optimal stepwise wick is proposed.  Preliminary calculations done by the PI indicate that the capillary limit of a heat pipe can be increased by a factor of 2x to 3.5x, depending on the number of discrete steps the wick is divided into.   The proposed program aims to demonstrate the improvement in capillary limit experimentally.* [Novel Fabrication of Nano Device for Single DNA/Protein Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gmtw-e8ur) - The health of the astronauts during space flight is critical to the success of NASA?s space program.  Astronauts are exposed to tremendous environmental challenges, such as cosmic radiation, microgravity and confined space.  Their immune systems are easily compromised.  To study these effects, biomarkers such as nucleic acids and protein are measured to determine how the body reacts and adjusts to the stresses.  Current detection methods rely on traditional molecular techniques that are time-consuming and require skillful operators.  Also, the equipment needed is bulky and require high-power consumption.  Therefore, many measurements are not conducted near real time but are completed after the samples are frozen and returned to earth.  This leads to uncertainty on the reliability of the data.  In order to overcome these problems, Lynntech proposes a novel method to fabrication a nano-electronic biochip that potentially can provide single DNA/protein detection in near real time.  The proposed biochip will be more sensitive, smaller, more reliable, lower cost, and easier to operate for NASA?s mission than the most commonly used optical methods.  The ultimate goal is to develop a small real-time nucleic acid and protein detection biochip capable of conducting measurements for long duration space missions.* [CH3D ICE ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ieqz-cmuv) - This data set is the result of laboratory transmission spectroscopy experiments performed within a sealed cell in the ice laboratory at Northern Arizona University. We record spectra at wavelengths from 1 to 6 microns to study CH3D bands at 2.47, 2.87, and 4.56 microns (as indicated by '25', '29' and '45' in the data file names). We report temperature-dependent absorption coefficients of these bands when the CH3D is diluted in CH4 ice and also when it is dissolved in N2 ice. These absorption coefficient spectra can be combined with data from the literature to simulate arbitrary D/H ratio absorption coefficients for CH4 ice and for CH4 in N2 ice. The data were originally published in 2011 in Icarus, vol. 212, pp. 941-949, and that paper should be consulted for details about laboratory procedures and limitations of the data.* [Chronic Telemetric Biofluid Flow Monitoring Device, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cgn9-betp) - Chronic Telemetric Biofluid Flow Monitoring Device, Phase I* [Three Dimensional Volumetric Terahertz Scanning for Aerospace Non Destructive Evaluation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c9u8-tt6k) - In this Phase I STTR project, we propose to develop the critical innovations necessary for a high speed three dimesnional terahertz (THz) tomographic imaging system for aerospace non destructive evaluation (NDE) applcations.  NASA and the Aerospace industry are beginning to utilize THz reflection imaging (for example, examining the space shuttle external tank sprayed on foam insulation for voids and disbonds).  THz NDE imaging is widely applicable to composite resin, ceramic, plastic, natural, and other non-metallic materials.  Current commercial equipment is capable of  two dimensional raster scanning.  The wider utility of THz NDE technology can be more fully exploited for the development of NASA and aerospace applications if the full potential for high speed three dimensional THz imaging is realized.  The current state of the art equipment collects the THz waveform reflection from a very narrow depth range from a strongly reflective backing.  The proposed innovations will increase the dynamic range of the THz waveform acquisition to allow collection of reflections from weaker interfaces, and will increase the window of high speed scanning of the THz waveform to allow three dimensional images to be reconstructed for objects many inches thick.* [Tissue-Equivalent Radiation Dosimeter-On-A-Chip, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vu7n-hh22) - Many commercially available digital dosimeters are bulky and are unable to properly measure dose for space radiation.  The complexity of space flight design requires reliable, fault-tolerant equipment with the capability of providing real-time dose readings during a mission, which is not feasible with the existing thermo-luminescent dosimeter (TLD) technology.  
The project will create a compact, lightweight, energy-efficient dose meter comprised of a tissue-equivalent scintillation crystal coupled to a solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM), which is an array of CMOS photodiodes, operated in Geiger avalanche mode.  The ubiquitous nature of CMOS technology provides a standardized development platform, and the ability to integrate all the supporting electronics into a miniature, simple design.  
	In Phase I, we will model the expected dosimeter performance and characterize the performance of a prototype dosimeter exposed to high-energy protons, which simulates radiation in the space environment.  We will also determine the TLD-dose equivalence of our measurements.  In Phase II, we will create the support software and design and fabricate a finalized chip that includes readout electronics, power supply, memory storage, and other interfacing components.* [CNT-Based Smart Electrostatic Filters for Capturing Nanoparticulate Lunar Regolith, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ewtn-bupp) - The abrasive, reactive, and ubiquitous nature of lunar regolith created significant and serious problems during the Apollo moon missions.  In this Phase I, Agave BioSystems, in collaboration with Dr. Randy Vander Wal of the Universities Space Research Association, propose to develop next generation smart filters using novel carbon nanotube (CNT)-based structures in electrostatic devices.  Since CNTs have extremely high surface area, can function without the mass transfer limitations of traditional filtrations systems, and they can be charged to emit very high charge densities, they constitute an ideal material for integration into spacecraft air handling systems as electrostatic filtration components.  The overall goal of this program is to build upon the unique structural and electronic nature of carbon nanotubes to create novel smart filters.  By synthesizing the CNTs in situ on solid mesh supports and integrating them into a novel electrostatic particle collection unit, we aim to create novel filtration media capable of removing airborne lunar regolith from spacecraft airlock and cabin atmospheres.* [High Interactivity Visualization Software for Large Computational Data Sets, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5y48-dmfd) - We propose to develop a collection of computer tools and libraries called SciViz that enable researchers to visualize large scale data sets on HPC resources remotely from their workstations at interactive rates.  The proposed technology will interoperate with common existing scientific visualization software and provide equivalent core functionality optimized for very large data sets. Existing scientific visualization tools have specific limitations for large scale scientific data sets.  Of these four limitations can be seen as paramount: (a) Memory Management, (b) Remote Visualization, (c) Interactivity, and (d) Specificity.  SciViz overcomes these four issues and uses stack oriented approach in order to produce tools that can be more easily and widely adopted with minimal interruption within existing visualization environments. SciViz  will be an open source implementation.* [Advanced Oxidation Technology for Potable Water Disinfection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e6ad-2kmw) - The availability of high-quality potable water is essential in crewed space missions. Closed loop water recycling systems as well as potable water holding tanks and waterlines provide environments for biofilm formation that can facilitate the growth of human pathogens, as well as organisms that can cause deterioration of distribution lines. Prevention requires the maintenance of a chemically stable and biologically effective residual concentration of biocide in water and wetted surfaces of the system. Current disinfection technologies in potable water systems for space applications utilize either iodine or silver biocide. Limitations exist in terms of incompatibility with some disinfection chemistries and surfaces, long-term health risk, rapid biocide depletion, and need for consumable supply and waste disposal. Lynntech proposes to develop an advanced disinfection system for water disinfection and biofilm prevention based on an on-demand biocide generator which does not require consumable chemicals. Excess disinfectant is decomposed on-demand into water and oxygen, representing zero toxicity for crew consumption of potable water. During the Phase I project, the effectiveness of the proposed system for potable water production will be demonstrated. During the Phase II project, an automated system will be developed and delivered to NASA.* [Rotor health monitoring combining spin tests and data-driven anomaly detection methods](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rbn3-kay3) - Health monitoring is highly dependent on sensor systems that are capable of performing in various engine environmental conditions and able to transmit a signal upon a predetermined crack length, while acting in a neutral form upon the overall performance of the engine system. Efforts are under way at NASA Glenn Research Center through support of the Intelligent Vehicle Health Management Project (IVHM) to develop and implement such sensor technology for a wide variety of applications. These efforts are focused on developing high temperature, wireless, low cost, and durable products. In an effort to address technical issues concerning health monitoring, this article considers data collected from an experimental study using high frequency capacitive sensor technology to capture blade tip clearance and tip timing measurements in a rotating turbine engine-like-disk to detect the disk faults and assess its structural integrity. The experimental results composed at a range of rotational speeds from tests conducted at the NASA Glenn Research Center’s Rotordynamics Laboratory are evaluated and integrated into multiple data-driven anomaly detection techniques to identify faults and anomalies in the disk. In summary, this study presents a select evaluation of online health monitoring of a rotating disk using high caliber capacitive sensors and demonstrates the capability of the in-house spin system.* [High Interactivity Visualization Software for Large Computational Data Sets, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ttzp-wtjx) - Existing scientific visualization tools have specific limitations for large scale scientific data sets.  Of these four limitations can be seen as paramount: (i) memory management, (ii) remote visualization, (iii) interactivity, and (iv) specificity.  In Phase I, we proposed and successfully developed a prototype of a collection of computer tools and libraries called SciViz that overcome these limitations and enable researchers to visualize large scale data sets (greater than 200 gigabytes) on HPC resources remotely from their workstations at interactive rates.  A key element of our technology is the stack oriented rather than a framework driven approach which allows it to interoperate with common existing scientific visualization software thereby eliminating the need for the user to switch and learn new software. The result is a versatile 3D visualization capability that will significantly decrease the time to knowledge discovery from large, complex data sets.

Typical visualization activity can be organized into a simple stack of steps that leads to the visualization result.  These steps can broadly be classified into data retrieval, data analysis, visual representation, and rendering.  Our approach will be to continue with the technique selected in Phase I of utilizing existing visualization tools at each point in the visualization stack and to develop specific tools that address the core limitations identified and seamlessly integrate them into the visualization stack.  Specifically, we intend to complete technical objectives in four areas that will complete the development of visualization tools for interactive visualization of very large data sets in each layer of the visualization stack.  These four areas are:  Feature Objectives, C++ Conversion and Optimization, Testing Objectives, and Domain Specifics and Integration.  The technology will be developed and tested at NASA and the San Diego Supercomputer Center.* [Prognostics-Enabled Power Supply for ADAPT Testbed, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u2d7-unwv) - Ridgetop's role is to develop electronic prognostics for sensing power systems in support of NASA/Ames ADAPT testbed. The prognostic enabled power systems from Ridgetop are to be integrated into NASA's Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed (ADAPT) and later used in the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).   Prognostics will provide power supply "state of health", remaining useful life (RUL) and notify operators of impending failures so that load-shedding or orderly switch-overs can be supported.

Using the ADAPT at NASA/Ames Research Center, Ridgetop will design, implement and validate a prototype prognostic sensor that employs both analog circuits and digital logic in a microcontroller unit (MCU) or microproprocessor controller (MPC) to "prognostics-enable" a high efficiency switching power converter.
The ADAPT is a testbed, developed to explore health-management systems in manned spaceflight with three main goals: 1) to assess performance of diagnostic tools and algorithms against a standardized testbed and repeatable failure scenarios, 2) to develop prognostic models (performance degradation, remaining life estimation) for spacecraft subsystems, and 3) prototype Advanced Caution and Warning System (ACAWS) algorithms and user interfaces.  

By developing effective and practical prognostics for a power supply, Ridgetop's role will be to extend the capabilities of the ADAPT testbed.* [Ceramic-Metal Interfaces by Functional Grading, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dwcs-bjbf) - Glacigen Materials proposes a novel technique for producing large-area sheets of functionally graded materials (FGM), which yield robust ceramic-metal interfaces capable of withstanding harsh environments that include high temperatures. Propulsion systems offer some of the harshest possible design conditions from a materials perspective and the demands placed on engineering materials will become more rigorous in future systems. The combination of structural and environmental constraints often dictate that ceramics and metals be used synergistically. Unfortunately, the limitations of ceramic-metal joining are exacerbated in these same environments where simultaneous use of ceramics and metals would be most useful. Large discrepancies in thermal expansion coefficients and near-planar interfaces lead to delamination and spallation even in the best engineered bonds.
     As a novel approach to this problem, Glacigen will create robust C-M interfaces by grading from one material phase to the other through a tailorable thickness. The technique is materials flexible, enjoys exceptional damage tolerance, and can accept significant mismatches in thermal expansion coefficients. The method for producing FGM sheets presented in this proposal will have the added advantage of controlled anisotropic properties within the sheets. In particular, it is anticipated that this new material system will be particularly valued for its damage tolerance at the interface where up to 96% of the interface can be destroyed before contact area is reduced to that of a planar joint with the same footprint. A second point of unique value will lie in the utility of engineered anisotropy where through thickness thermal conductivity is expected to be dramatically higher than in-plane thermal conductivity. Phase I efforts will demonstrate fabrication of these sheets and will include the characterization of mechanical, thermal, and functional properties.* [SMEX03 ALMNet and SCAN Soil Moisture Data: Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7rsh-qm5x) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.

This data set includes soil moisture data collected at crop, pasture, and forested sites located within the Alabama MesoNet (ALMNet) network.* [Rapid In-Place Composite Rotor Damage Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/m2ry-upak) - Luna Innovations is proposing to further develop the Rapid In-Place Composite Rotor Damage Detection (RIPCoRDD) System for determining and tracking the structural health of composite rotorcraft blades and other composite structures. There is a need for accurate, reliable assessments of the condition of composite parts which may have been damaged through impacts, fatigue, or abrasion.  This is especially true for cases in which the  damage may not be visible from the surface. The RIPCoRDD system is designed such that it will enable composite rotor damage detection in seconds with absolutely no increase in weight, power consumption, or volume of the rotorcraft. The core of the RIPCoRDD device is a unique, distributed, high-definition fiber optic strain sensor (HD-FOS) which provides spatially dense strain measurements (every 1.25-2.5 mm) within the composite structure, coupled with a ground based installation of Luna's proven optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) instrumentation.  Commercialization will focus on transitioning the technology first to OEM manufacturers for non-destructive inspection applications, followed by deployment to rotorcraft end users for lifetime monitoring and diagnostics.* [Coded Aperture Techniques for High-Throughput Imaging Spectroscopy, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vet2-zjf8) - We propose the use of programmable, two-dimensional (2D) coded apertures for high-throughput imaging spectroscopy. Spatially-varying, 2D, transmissive or reflective encoded mask, such as a hadamard or bernoulli random matrix, can be leveraged to realize high-throughput variants of many standard imaging spectroscopy techniques with throughput enhancements surpassing 50-100x compared to slit-based systems. In addition, recent advances in fast-switching spatial light modulators enable the reprogramming of mask encoding on the millisecond timescale. The combination these two technologies enables a wide array of potential innovations for hyperspectral imaging systems offering high-throughput, compressive measurement, with significant operational-flexibility. In this proposal, we target the application of these techniques to the development of a high-throughput, pushbroom imaging spectrometer for planetary science applications.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/p7jp-ncu7) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [FLASHRAD: A 3D Rad Hard Memory Module For High Performance Space Computers, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vfb2-e934) - The computing capabilities of onboard spacecraft are a major limiting factor for accomplishing many classes of future missions. Although technology development efforts are underway that will provide improvements to spacecraft central processing units (CPUs) they do not address the limitations of current onboard memory systems. In addition to CPU upgrades, effective execution of data-intensive operations such as terrain relative navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning and scheduling, and onboard science data processing and analysis require high-bandwidth, low-latency memory systems to maximize processor usage (i.e. to overcome the "memory wall").  Copious amounts of data being generated on a mission require large amounts of non-volatile memory storage in order to store this data for transmission back to earth when power to do this operation is available.  Furthermore, the memory system must be capable of providing the necessary operational robustness and fault tolerance required for space applications.  In an effort to support the needs for NASA's High Performance Space Computer (HPSC), it is proposed that this research investigates the challenges and opportunities in developing a space-qualified, 3D Flash memory cube utilizing COTS memory devices supplemented with a custom Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) controller.  Focus would be on developing a NAND Flash memory module that could be used for SSRs to help increase the memory densities, lower power, lower cost and to achieve higher data throughput.* [High Watts per Kilogram - Advanced Integration and Heat Management solar array technology (HaWK-AIHM ), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ere4-hiiu) - Small satellite architectures have become a desirable low cost alternative to larger heritage spacecraft for advanced scientific missions.  Unfortunately, the traditional component make-up of a small satellite or cubesats is for short duration missions and not specifically designed for space environment resiliency. NASA has identified several scientific missions which would benefit from highly engineered, space environment tolerant and high reliability components. MMA Design (MMA) proposes new innovations in small satellite deployable solar arrays for theses missions, specifically targeting high reliability, simple and heritage proven designs, and high performance. • Composite deployable hinge mechanism - due to volumetric constraints and stowed thickness requirements, an innovative composite panel-to-panel hinge mechanism is required. MMA has extensive knowledge in the design, manufacturing and test of composite tape hinges for deployable structures. The challenges that will be addressed in this effort is how to design a composite hinge with a tight stowed radius of curvature and a method of integration to the substrate panels that provides higher thermal conductivity than a traditional clevis hinge. • Advance high stiffness, high-k solar array substrates, multi-functional - limitations with traditional polyimide or glass-fiber substrates is that they exhibit low stiffness and thermal conductivity properties. Alternatively, High-K Mesophase-pitch based graphite fibers would provide magnitudes higher thermal conductivity, thus providing better heat transfer throughout the solar array panel. Also proposed are innovations in co-cured substrate construction whereby a highly emissive film is cured directly into the substrate panel creating a surface for significant heat rejection a on the backside of the solar array. The front side of the panel will also include a cured in circuit trace, which will significantly reduce wiring routing on the solar panel.* [Pre-collimator Chemical Milling for X-ray Telescopes, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4ezd-iwhj) - Combining Chemical Milling with wire Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM), Mindrum Precision will build a precollimator (PC) faster and more cost effective than current methods.

  Space-based x-ray telescopes currently involve the use of a PC to shield the optics from stray light. Each PC requires extensive build time from highly skilled technicians. The PC cylindrical aluminum ribs (or blades) are individually attached to alignment frames. This hands-on "place/weld/measure and repeat" process is ineffective for the thousands of ribs. Build times have exceeded a year, and sometimes the PC still failed to perform. Some telescopes scrap the PC early to avoid these complications and accept the limitations in performance.

  Eliminating the hands-on time with CNC unattended wire EDM automates the build, but can't reach the thin walls required. Chemical milling of this large, complex structure is an innovation which will bring fast and affordable PC to market. 

  Current chemical milling uses HF and HNO3 acids to etch thin films of Titanium. However, etching is traditionally done on thin sheets. Mindrum Precision process will investigate etching of this complex material. New concentration levels, etch times, and agitation methods will be explored to achieve a uniform etch along the entire length of the numerous 3" slots.  

  Mindrum Precision will combine wire EDM with Chemical Milling to rapidly make affordable precollimators for future telescopes.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3x3c-y2vz) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios provide useful insight into the complex factors that drive ecosystem change, estimating the magnitude 

of regional pressures on ecosystems and critical uncertainties that could undermine sustainable development. They also provide an understanding of the importance of institutions and values 

as the long-range outlook for the world's ecosystems depends on the course taken by global and regional development in the coming decades. The integration of changing ecosystem conditions 

into the global scenarios was taken as both effects and causes. The MA scenarios include those for population, income, cereal production and consumption, meat production and consumption, 

land cover, waster stress, water availability, acidification and nitrogen deposition. (Suggested Usage: To preserve access to the original set of socioeconomic and natural resource scenarios used by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and other related research.)* [LBA Regional Monthly Climatology for the 20th Century (New et al.)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6mcj-hb8i) - ABSTRACT: This data set is a subset of "Global Monthly Climatology for the 20th Century (New et al.)" (2000a). This subset characterizes mean monthly surface climate over the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., latitude 10 N to 25 S, longitude 30 to 85 W) during nearly all of the 20th Century. The data are gridded at 0.5-degree latitude/longitude resolution and include seven variables: precipitation, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure, cloud cover, and ground-frost frequency. All variables have mean monthly values for the period 1901-1995, several have data as recent as 1998, and further data will be added by the data originators. In constructing the monthly grids, the authors used an anomaly approach that attempts to maximize station data in space and time (New et al. 2000b). In this technique, grids of monthly historic anomalies are derived in relation to a standard normal period. Station measurement data for the years 1961-1990 were extracted from the monthly data holdings of the Climatic Research Unit and the Global Historic Climatology Network (GHCN) and used in constructing the normal period (New et al. 1999). The anomaly grids were then combined with high-resolution mean monthly climatology to arrive at fields of estimated historical monthly surface climate. Data are in ASCII GRID format for ArcInfo. Information on creating this LBA subset is available in ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/physical_climate/GIS_EastAngliaClimateMonthly/comp/eastanglia_readme.pdf.Data users are encouraged to see the companion file New et al. (2000) for a complete description of this technique and potential applications and limitations of the data set. For additional information, refer to the IPCC Data Distribution Centre.To access the complete year-by-year monthly data set or data more recent than posted here, users may make a request with the Climate Impacts LINK Project at the Climatic Research Unit (e-mail: d.viner@uea.ac.uk; web site: www.cru.uea.ac.uk/link). LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system. More information about LBA can be found at http://www.daac.ornl.gov/LBA/misc_amazon.html.* [Micromechanical Models for Composite NDE and Diagnostics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7s66-axmk) - Modern aircraft increasingly rely on composite components, due to their excellent material properties.  However, fastening/joining and design methodologies in current use are artifacts of metallic aircraft component use and are not yet optimized for use with composites.  Furthermore, limitations in our current ability to observe manufacturing quality and in-service damage evolution of composite structures may prevent designers from realizing their full potential. Current NDE practices are incapable of overcoming these limitations. Thus, a new framework and methodology is needed for high resolution imaging and tracking of manufacturing quality and damage evolution.

The goal of this program is to enable assessment of the matrix, fiber, and bonding conditions for composites using a combination of detailed physics based models, high resolution imaging, and controlled loading sources to isolate the composite characteristic of interest.  In Phase I we will focus on magnetic field sensing (i.e., eddy-current) methods that can be combined with structural analysis to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of these NDE methods.  JENTEK and MR&D are well-positioned to deliver this methodology in the form of commercial software and NDE equipment.  We will also work with a major aircraft OEM to maintain our focus on practical solutions to high priority needs.* [Low-Loss Ferrite Components for NASA Missions, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7ie9-2qdq) - The goal of this research is to develop high-frequency Faraday rotation isolators that exhibit significantly reduced loss, higher power handling and improved bandwidth over commercially available products. The bandwidth limitations of high-frequency circulators will be explored. It was demonstrated in the Phase I work that the bandwidth of these components can be substantially increased through impedance matching techniques. At the end of the Phase II program, Micro Harmonics will have developed a full line of isolators operating in bands from WR-12 through WR-3 and circulators working in bands from WR-15 through WR-5. In the phase I work our models were proven to be accurate. The approach is fundamentally sound, but there are significant technical challenges. These components will find immediate use in a broad range of systems used by NASA as well as the commercial sector.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Population](https://data.nasa.gov/d/b3rc-4ua4) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Population data sets provide baseline population information as one of the drivers of ecosystem change. The data helped in estimating the magnitude of regional pressures on ecosystems. The MA Population data sets include Gridded Population of the World (GPW) version 3, population grids from the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) (alpha version), Global Subnational Infant Mortality Rates (alpha version), and Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition (alpha version) data. (Suggested Usage: To preserve access to the original global and regional population data used by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and other related research.)* [SMEX03 ENVISAT ASAR Data, Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5jgs-spka) - This data set is comprised of browse images acquired over the regional study areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma USA as part of the 2003 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX03).* [Advanced SiC-Matrix Composites with Improved Oxidation Resistance and Life, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kc2x-hcnx) - The objective of this proposed effort is to demonstrate the promise of advanced C/SiC and SiC/SiC composites having improved environmental durability and longer life at higher allowable stress levels without using problematic external barrier coatings. Both oxidation inhibited C/SiC and SiC/SiC composite material systems are proposed for this effort on the basis that: (1) C/SiC offers the highest use temperature and lowest cost of all currently available refractory composite systems, and (2) SiC/SiC offers the highest durability and longest life. Each material system offers unique performance/cost benefits and limitations, and each has been identified as a viable candidate for advanced propulsion and thermal protection system component applications. Oxidation resistant C/SiC and SiC/SiC composite plates will be fabricated incorporating a recently developed, 2nd generation oxidation inhibited matrix produced by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). Test samples from each material system will be prepared and experimentally evaluated in high-temperature tensile stress oxidation environments. The tensile stress rupture results will be compared to "baseline" uninhibited C/SiC and SiC/SiC composites to establish the performance benefits of the proposed approach.* [Production of Mature Highland Lunar Regolith Simulant, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jwgk-twqc) - As NASA considers manned and/or unmanned return missions to the Moon and beyond, it is imperative that high fidelity lunar soil simulants be developed in order to accurately evaluate the life span and efficiency of any equipment exposed to the lunar surface. One of the significant limitations of current simulants is the lack of certain constituents, such as agglutinates. These constituents, which can account for up to 60% by volume of a mature regolith soil, are widely regarded as components that must be present in any high fidelity simulant. Recently, Plasma Processes, Inc. has developed a process to produce Mare agglutinate simulant particles from JSC-1A feedstock. Characterization has confirmed that these agglutinate simulants have features (e.g. morphology, chemistry, crystalline phase content, nano-phase Fe) similar to actual lunar agglutinates.  When mixed with the JSC-1A root simulant in the correct proportions, the combination results in a high fidelity derivative Mare simulant. However, considering approximately 87% of the lunar surface consists of Highland regolith composition, mature Highland simulants are also of great interest. Hence, the primary technical objective of the proposed Phase I effort is to extend the technology employed to enhance the fidelity of Mare simulants to the production of high fidelity derivative Highland simulants.* [Transcription profiling of activated human T cells induced by microgravity to identify apoptotic genes and other immune response genes](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ba3q-54e9) - The purpose of this study was to search for microgravity-sensitive genes specifically for apoptotic genes influenced by the microgravity environment and other genes related to immune response. Experiment Overall Design: Two-group design with paired samples i.e. one 1G and one MMG culture came from the same donor. Therefore 6 samples came from 3 different donors.

Soil characteristics reported for all five study sites include cation information (e.g., H, Al, Mg, K, Na, S), percent of soil C, N, and organic matter, soil texture/composition and color, pH, and land use history. Soil bulk density and tons of carbon/ha are reported for only three of the study sites: Altamira, Bragantina, and Tome-Acu. All of the data are provided in one comma-separated data file.The five study areas represent characteristic differences in soil fertility and a range of land uses typical of the Amazon region. One of these areas, Altamira, is characterized by above average pH, nutrients, and texture. The other four areas are more typical of the 75 percent of the Amazon that is characterized by Oxisols and Ultisols, with well-drained but low pH and low levels of nutrients. Ponta de Pedras in Marajo Island, located in the estuary, is composed of upland Oxisols and floodplain alluvial soils. Igarape-Acu in the Bragantina region is characterized by both nutrient-poor Spodosols and Oxisols. Tome-Acu, south of Igarape-Acu, represents a mosaic of Oxisols and Ultisols. Yapu, in the Colombian Vaupes, is composed of patches of Spodosols and Oxisols. Three of the areas are colonization regions at various degrees of development: Altamira is a colonization front that opened up in 1971, whereas Tome-Acu was settled by a Japanese population in the 1930s, and Bragantina was settled in the early part of the twentieth century. Marajo (Ponta de Pedras) is the home of caboclos, whereas Yapu is home to Tukanoan Native American populations. In these study areas  slash-and-burn cultivation as well as plantation agriculture and mechanized agriculture are employed. Length of fallows vary in these communities. The two indigenous areas leave their land in longer fallow than do the three colonization areas, and the proportion of land prepared from secondary forests increases with length of settlement as the stock of mature forest declines over time.* [Asteroid Tomography](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hbca-i2rp) - <p>This proposed project will perform the study and simulation, of a concept for an instrument to tomographically map the internal density (structure) of an asteroid using Atom Interferometric Gravity Gradiometers (AIGG).&nbsp; The targeted outcomes are instrument design parameters, performance limitations, possible mission configurations, and a road map for further technology maturation.</p> <p>The objective of this project is to continue to mature the concept of the gravity gradiometer instrument through simulation, development of its design parameters, and establishing its limitation.&nbsp; The Project will work with other Projects with potential missions on which this technology would provide detection possibilities beyond current state of instrumentation.</p>* [Integrated Structural Health Management, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/js8v-8cyb) - Cornerstone Research Group Inc. (CRG) proposes to advance the state of the art in composite health management through refinement of an existing technology developed by CRG called Reflexive Composites.  Reflexive Composites are the current state of the art in health management integrating piezoelectric structural health monitoring, healable polymer matrix composites, and intelligent controls delivering highly aware structures capable of identifying location and magnitude of damage with 1/16" spatial resolution.  Reflexive Composites respond to damage with a healing cycle capable of restoring up to 90% of mechanical performance post failure.   
CRG proposes to advance the state of the art in health management through the development of a next generation control system capable of analyzing structural health monitoring (SHM) data and determining the appropriate healing cycle, identifying the type of failure in the composite, make predictions to the loss in mechanical performance, generating custom healing cycles based on failure type, healing, and making predictions of restored mechanical strength.  The results of this analysis will allow the vehicle user to make any necessary mission adjustment to ensure vehicle survivability with the damaged structures on the vehicle.* [Superconducting Resonator Spectrometer for Millimeter- and Submillimeter-Wave Astrophysics Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ubuz-hvig) - "We propose to develop a novel ultra-compact spectrograph-on-a-chip for the submillimeter and millimeter waveband. SuperSpec uses planar lithographed superconducting transmission-line filters to sort incident radiation by frequency to an array of direct detectors such as MKIDs. The system is naturally wideband and can be very low loss, enabling background-limited spectroscopy on the ground and in space, as is currently done with a diffraction grating spectrographs. But while moderate-resolution grating systems for the mm and submm bands have sizes measured in tens of centimeters, SuperSpec can have a size measured in millimeters. If successful, SuperSpec will pave the way for a new kind of astronomical instrument for the submm/mm: a 2-D array of hundreds to thousands of individual spectrometers, each simultaneously measuring a separate spectrum. With the possible exception of polarization, such an instrument extracts all available information from the light at a telescope focal plane.



SuperSpec thus offers the potential to revolutionize astrophysics in the far-IR through millimeter, an important spectral regime for which the the Astro2010 Decadal Survey made two specific recommendations for this decade: 1) Participate in the Japanese-led SPICA space telescope with a spectrometer instrument such as BLISS, and 2) Construct CCAT and its associated instrumentation. Depending on SPICA's schedule, SuperSpec technology could be injected and would enhance and extend the long-wavelength capability of BLISS or a similar instrument. Whether or not SPICA moves ahead quickly, our demonstration will position SuperSpec to be used in on CCAT and suborbital platforms this decade, paving the way for optimal science return with future NASA-led cryogenic far-IR space missions on the drawing board for the next decade: CALISTO/SAFIR and SPIRIT.



SuperSpec is based on propagation on a superconducting transmission line (TL). As radiation propagates along the line, it encounters a seri* [General Purpose Data-Driven System Monitoring for Space Operations](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gfra-htnj) - Modern space propulsion and exploration system designs are becoming increasingly
sophisticated and complex. Determining the health state of these systems using traditional methods is becoming more difficult as the number of sensors and component interactions grows. Data-driven monitoring techniques have been developed to address these issues by
analyzing system operations data to automatically characterize normal system behavior. The Inductive Monitoring System is a data-driven system health monitoring software tool that has been successfully applied to several aerospace applications. Inductive Monitoring System uses a data mining technique called clustering to analyze archived system data and characterize
normal interactions between parameters. This characterization, or model, of nominal operation is stored in a knowledge base that can be used for real-time system monitoring or
for analysis of archived events. Ongoing and developing Inductive Monitoring System space operations applications include International Space Station flight control, spacecraft vehicle
system health management, launch vehicle ground operations, and fleet supportability. As a common thread of discussion this paper will employ the evolution of the Inductive Monitoring
System data-driven technique as related to several Integrated Systems Health Management elements. Thematically, the projects listed will be used as case studies. The maturation of Inductive Monitoring System via projects where it has been deployed or is currently being
integrated to aid in fault detection will be described. The paper will also explain how Inductive Monitoring System can be used to complement a suite of other Integrated System Health Management tools, providing initial fault detection support for diagnosis and recovery.* [Large-Area, Self-Sufficient, Low-Cost MEMS Skin with Integrated Wirleless Communication Capability, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dhnk-nru5) - An integrated unit that harnesses its energy from its surroundings and reacts to, and transmits, any changes in its environment in a predictable and reliable manner would be of significant benefit to the sensor community.  Advances in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), silicon, SiGe, and GaAs fabrication technologies have helped to constantly add new sensing and communication functionality in a given device footprint.  A significant limitation with the current state-of-the-art processes though, is the constraint to fabricate devices and circuits on a relatively high-cost, defect-free, single-crystal, base substrate.  This has also limited the potential of an integrated mixed-material design solution that is a key to high-performance communication systems.  Finally, a lack of large-area processing tools has precluded the development of a stand-alone, large-area sensor skin.  Building on Anvik?s proven, large-area, excimer laser based recrystallization and annealing technologies, and ongoing efforts in developing MEMS process technologies on flexible substrates, we propose to develop a fabrication technology to enable wireless communication circuitry on low-cost, flexible base substrates for large-area ?skins?.  There are several applications for this technology in free-moving sensor systems, space-based MEMS and distributed sensor networks for health-monitoring of space based systems, and commercial applications such as cell-phones and PDAs.* [Functionalized Nano-Film Microchannel Plate: A Single High Aspect Ratio Device for High Resolution, Low Noise Astronomical Imaging, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i6kh-5eha) - The proposed innovation is to apply proven nano-film technology to enable Microchannel plate (MCP) devices to be manufactured on a range of insulating substrates and devices which possess sufficiently high gain and low ion feedback to replace chevron stacks in current NASA detector technologies.  Commercial MCP devices have many desirable properties, such as sensitivity to small amounts of light and excellent position and timing resolution.  MCP production is a mature technology, based largely on techniques and materials developed in the 1970's, and is limited to small area devices. Limitations due to the bulk glass manufacturing technology adversely impact many applications and impair manufacturability.  For example, heavy metal impurities contained within the bulk glass of the MCP limit the achievable dark noise in low signal detection.   In MCP manufacturing, the requisite batch processing restricts flexibility to tailor individual device or small batch performance to specific applications and can often result in poor MCP yield due to variations in composition and poor process control.   In this proposal, we will utilize atomic layer deposition (ALD) of nanometer thin films which has been proven to replicate and improve the component functions of secondary electron emission (SEE) and conductivity on non-traditional glass substrates, to investigate the high gain and low ion feedback capabilities of this technology.  We estimate that the technology stands at TRL 2 at the and expect to be at 4 at end of the Phase 1 contract.* [Miniaturized High Performance Optical Gyroscope, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gvmt-2x42) - We propose a new approach for to the design and fabrication of miniaturized Interferometric Fiber Optical Gyroscope (FOG) that enables the production of smaller IRU with enhanced performance. The size and performance limitations of the standard FOG are being reduced due to the utilization of highly integrated approach of all the gyro components. Specifically, the ASE light source and the receivers, splitters and TIA are all incorporated in a small, robust silicon/silica platform using hybrid integration. In addition, the sensor is using an innovative new coil design and high performance miniaturized IOC that results in tenfold reduction of the bias temperature sensitivity compared to the existing FOG products. The combination of these attributes supports a smaller, lower cost, high performance and robust IRU that can serve future NASA mission needs.* [Space Radiation Risk Assessment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/skv9-cxne) - Project A: Integration and Review: A review of current knowledge from space radiation physics was accepted for publication in Reviews of Modern Physics (Durante and Cucinotta, 2011). Several Graphical Users Interface’s (GUI) of risk assessment models and computational tools were developed and published including: a) ARRBOD (Acute Radiation Risk and BRYTNRN Organ Dose);  b) NSCR (NASA Space Cancer Risk) c) GERMCode (Galactic Cosmic Radiation, GCR, Event-based Risk Model); d) RITracks (Relativistic Ion Track Structure). The GERMcode was developed to accurately describe fragmentation in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) beam-line and biological samples, and basic radiobiology experiments.     <p></p>

4)	Revised uncertainty assessments for all model coefficients in the risk model (physics, low LET risk coefficients, dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF), and quality factors), and an alternative uncertainty assessment that considers deviation from linear responses due to non-targeted effects (NTE).    <p></p>
Results of calculations for the average U.S. population show more restrictive dose limits for astronauts above age 40 y as compared to National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Report 132, and a modest narrowing of uncertainties if NTEs are not included and much broader uncertainties with NTEs. Risks for never-smokers compared to the average U.S. population are estimated in a mixture model to be reduced by more than 20% and 30% for males and females, respectively. A larger reduction is possible if purely multiplicative risk transfer is assumed.     <p></p>
Project C: Biochemical Kinetics Models of Molecular Pathways: A system biology model (Cucinotta et al., 2008) of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway was developed and used to make quantitative descriptions of the gamma H2AX foci and double strand break (DSB) rejoining experiments. The model is extended to consider the radiation quality dependence of the relative fraction of simple and complex DSB, rejoining and associated repair defects, and the kinetics of various radiation induced foci (RIF). In further work, the addition of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and the MRN complex to the model was achieved and the role of processing damaged ends by the Artemis proteins is being modeled (Li and Cucinotta, 2011).  The interaction of several growth factors with NHEJ components was studied, including the interaction of the growth factors EGFR, IGF1, and TGFbeta-Smad with ATM and DNA-PK. New approaches to Green’s functions for stochastic treatment of molecular diffusion processes were developed (Plante et al. 2011). Flow cytometry or immune-staining considers signals in individual cells and thus provides several unique capabilities to support computation modeling using stochastic approaches. In contrast, methods that average the values of many cells such as Western blots, gene arrays, etc. are limited in elucidating events at low dose where fluctuations are expected to be important. To improve our understanding of DNA repair complexes numerical approaches to simulate immunohistochemistry (Ponomarev et al., 2008,* [Broadband Reflective Coating Process for Large FUVOIR Mirrors, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sfhn-g8xj) - ZeCoat Corporation will develop and demonstrate a set of revolutionary coating processes for making broadband reflective coatings suitable for very large mirrors (4+ meters). Decades of research and flight missions (Hubble, GALAX and FUSE) have utilized metal fluorides such as, MgF2 and LiF, applied to Al to achieve FUVOIR coating requirements. While metal fluoride-protected Al remains the best option for meeting broadband reflectance requirements (90-nm to 2500-nm), ZeCoat offers a means to build upon the best known and proven coating recipe (the GSFC 3-step process) by: 1) utilizing ZeCoat's unique precision motion-controlled deposition system to uniformly apply a 5-nm layer (a requirement of the GSFC recipe) of coating material to a large coating area, 2) protecting mirror assemblies from damaging high temperatures by heating only the mirror surface using radiant heat (the GSFC process requires a 220C metal-fluoride deposition temperature), 3) using an FUV reflectometer (120-nm to 180-nm) integrated into the coating chamber to optimize the coating process for FUV reflectance and 4) investigating the feasibility of using a layer of Sn to protect LiF from degradation due to atmospheric moisture and organic contamination during ground storage and  re-evaporate the Sn once the observatory is placed in-orbit.* [Microdischarge Array Flexible Light Source for High-Efficiency Irradiation of Spaced-Based Crops, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v6kj-7z6e) - It is desirable to develop a high-efficiency lighting source for large-area irradiation of space-based crops.  The key requirements for such a system include high efficiency,  light weight, easy and rapid deployment, compact storage, ruggedness, and low cost.  Furthermore, in order to maximize the rate of photosynthesis, it is desirable that the light source deliver an emission spectrum that matches the absorbance spectrum of chlorophyll as closely as possible while minimizing the effects of emission outside of the visible spectrum.  To address these demanding requirements and overcome the limitations of alternative technologies, we propose to develop a large-area, high-efficiency, flexible sheet light source using microdischarge arrays using the combined talents of Anvik Corporation and a team from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, led by Prof. J. Gary Eden.  The development of a new technology to enable the fabrication of large-area, high-density microdischarge arrays on flexible substrates, possibly powered by solar cells, will enable dramatic advances in the portability, ruggedness, efficiency, and light quality of light sources for space-based crop irradiation and a wide variety of commercial applications, including LCD backlighting, large-area UV-curing, decorative lighting, photodynamic therapy, and germicidal applications.* [Lightweight High Temperature Beta Gamma Alloy/Process Development for Disk and Blade Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a4v6-9kwq) - The primary material and manufacturing limitations of gamma TiAl alloys include processing difficulties, requiring costly non-conventional processing requirements, and large lamellar grains, which reduces damage tolerance.  We have developed a new class of TiAl-based alloys, called beta gamma, which would remove such barriers.   Unlike existing gamma alloys, beta gamma alloys are designed such that the ductile â phase is adequate at elevated temperatures (for processing) but negligible at the anticipated use temperatures (for performance).  The alloys also feature significant grain refinement and compositional homogeneity.  This program is aimed to utilize such beneficial beta-phase distribution and microstructure features observed in small (0.7kg) samples into forged disks from medium size (25kg) ingots.  The process-ability will be validated by employing a conventional forging process, and refined lamellar microstructures will be generated through usual alpha treatments.  The significance of this innovation is that beta gamma alloy disks can not only be produced by conventional forging, but also show improvements in RT strength and ductility and may retain other attributes (density, creep and oxidation) of conventional gamma alloys.* [Laser frequency stabilization and stray light issues for LISA and other future multi-spacecraft missions Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/psmf-ze9h) - "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a joint NASA/ESA project which will use laser interferometry between drag-free proof masses to measure gravitational waves from many galactic and cosmological sources. The same interferometer technology is also the key to future multi-spacecraft missions such as multi-aperture telescope missions. These missions could include several spacecraft all separated by potentially 10s of km, flying in a fixed formation with sub-wavelength variations in their distances. These multi-aperture or distributed aperture telescopes will revolutionize the angular resolution in the infrared, optical, and even X-ray band.  This proposal addresses two components which are both critical to these missions.

The first component introduces a new technique to stabilize the laser frequency to an optical reference cavity. Laser frequency noise will be the limiting factor for most of the distributed aperture telescope missions; in contrast, LISA can trade frequency noise against ranging precision. This new technique is based on heterodyne interferometry which is also used to measure changes in the distances between the spacecraft. Because of this similarity, this  technology can easily be integrated into the payload. It requires the same photo detectors and digital signal processing systems that are used for the interferometry. It utilizes to a large degree existing components, reducing R&amp;D time and cost for all interferometric space missions. We have already started initial proof of principle experiments and have reached already a performance remarkably close to the performance of the standard and long time-favored modulation/demodulation technique. Now we propose to study this technique in more detail, study the limiting noise sources experimentally and theoretically, and push it to the limitations of the reference cavity itself. The expected final fractional frequency noise should be better than 0.01ppt for measurement times of a 1000s.

(2000a). This subset characterizes mean monthly surface climate over the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., latitude 10 N to 25 S, longitude 30 to 85 W) during nearly all of the 20th Century. The data are gridded at 0.5-degree latitude/longitude resolution and include seven variables: precipitation, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure, cloud cover, and ground-frost frequency. All variables have mean monthly values for the period 1901-1995, several have data as recent as 1998, and further data will be added by the data originators. In constructing the monthly grids, the authors used an anomaly approach that attempts to maximize station data in space and time (New et al. 2000b). In this technique, grids of monthly historic anomalies are derived in relation to a standard normal period. Station measurement data for the years 1961-1990 were extracted from the monthly data holdings of the Climatic Research Unit and the Global Historic Climatology Network (GHCN) and used in constructing the normal period (New et al. 1999). The anomaly grids were then combined with high-resolution mean monthly climatology to arrive at fields of estimated historical monthly surface climate. Data are in ASCII GRID format for ArcInfo. Information on creating this LBA subset is available in ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/physical_climate/GIS_EastAngliaClimateMonthly/comp/eastanglia_readme.pdf.Data users are encouraged to see the companion file New et al.

This project&nbsp;expands on the concept of a planetary entry probe based on the widely popular Cubesat-class spacecraft specification (Cubesat Application for Planetary Entry Missions, or CAPE probes). Within a science operational context, CAPE probes may be sent from Earth to study a celestial body&rsquo;s atmosphere, or to land/impact on some high-value target on its surface. Either one or multiple probes may be targeted to distributed locations throughout the geographic landscape and could be released systematically and methodically from an orbiting spacecraft. CAPE microprobes would each have its own propulsion, and hence would be capable of targeting regions identified by the mother ship as high-interest. This enables a completely new capability for science not possible with traditional &ldquo;drop-and-flyby&rdquo; schemes. To supplement its flexibility, each probe would incorporate a communications architecture that provides a high-level of assurance its precious data is acquired and transmitted back to Earth for analysis.&nbsp;CAPE consists of two main functional components: the &ldquo;service module&rdquo; (SM), and the &ldquo;planetary entry probe&rdquo; (PEP).

This size limitation prevents using this fabrication method for production of molds for operational size space concentrators and off-axis (non-concentric) patterns cannot be produced at all with lathes.  UAT has been demonstrated that computer numerical control (CNC) milling machines that can readily machine complex geometries, including any radius of curvature, can be used to produce mold segments representing any portion of any size MPRS.  These mold patterns can then be replicated on thin film sheets, which are then appropriately integrated to produce solar concentrators of the desired size. Multiple focal lengths/points, concentration ratios, and controlled flux distribution can be incorporated in a single reflector panel allowing substantial and previously unavailable Wireless Power Transfer System design flexibility.
	The Phase I program will verify the thin film performance capabilities and scalability of the MPRS concept and the Phase II program will provide a full scale concentrator applicable to Wireless Power Transfer technology for testing and deployment.* [High Test Peroxide High Sealing Conical Seal, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pekh-gem9) - High Test Peroxide (HTP) Highly Compatible High Sealing Conical Seals are necessary for ground test operations and space based applications.  Current conical seals are all made from relatively incompatible materials and the most compatible materials have limitations: stainless steel seals are hard to seat, especially at large sizes and are still only acceptable for short term exposure at best, whereas aluminum seals corrode quickly when exposed to HTP and other metals such as stainless steel.  The other common materials for conical seals, copper and nickel, are unsuited for HTP applications.  A highly compatible conical seal is non-existent, and the best seal available is stainless steel which is at best Class 2 and difficult to seal.  High compatible conical seals will permit long term storage HTP systems to be created and will improve operations which are currently using short term HTP systems.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Diurnal (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pwvn-iv8e) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

Current technologies including 3He detectors, scintillators, and solid-state detectors are bulky and expensive.  We developed a new radiation detection method and architecture. Some liquids react to radiation exposure with a change in molecular structure, leading to a change in properties such as dielectric constant and polarization. Inspired by such responsivity of liquids, we  constructed a transistor with a radiation-responsive liquid as a gate dielectric replacing the conventional oxide gate layer. The current voltage characteristics of the liquid gate dielectric transistor  change upon exposure to any type of radiation. Different types of liquids that specifically interact with various target radiations can be used in an array of transistors serving as a radiation nose to discriminate different radiation sources. Moreover, the fluidity of the liquid facilitates the exchange of the damaged liquid with fresh liquid after some time, allowing a reusable sensor. Selection of liquid-state gate dielectric is important for an acceptable device performance, and the choice should satisfy the following requirements: insulating properties, proper dielectric constant, dielectric strength, thermal stability, high purity, low moisture absorption, low viscosity, and responsive to radiation. Preliminary results from this project include detection of gamma radiation.  Future work would include development of a radiation nose capable of detecting multiple types of radiation with energy discrimination.</p>* [Paper-based Biosensor for Rapid Colorimetric Detection of Pathogenic Bacteria](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gc4j-v5av) - <p>The current project proposes to develop a real-time method for identification of targeted microorganisms using a paper-based biosensor system with ease-of-use, minimal requirement of time, and a simple interpretation of results imparted by colorimetric indication. To prove the feasibility of this approach, a binding target (ligand), specific for the bacterial pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, will be attached to gold nanoparticle carriers (nanoconjugate), that are supported on a paper strip. Upon interaction with the bacteria, the nanoconjugates will aggregate, resulting in a color change on the paper.  Due to the high sensitivity and specificity of the ligand, only the presence of S. aureus in a sample will result in a color change.<p/><p>The ability to monitor microbial contamination remains a critical technique in the mitigation of risk to crew health and vehicle systems during human spaceflight missions. Current methods of bacterial and fungal monitoring on the International Space Station (ISS) depend on culturing of microorganisms during spaceflight and subsequent ground-based identification. This approach requires substantial crew time, uses consumables with short shelf lives, and prevents a rapid response to microbial contamination. To address these limitations for future missions beyond low-Earth orbit, a biosensor using gold nanoparticles is being developed for the rapid detection of medically significant microorganisms. For proof-of-concept, we have targeted the detection of Staphylococcus aureus, a common infectious agent that has been repeatedly isolated aboard the ISS. Gold nanoparticles were modified by the covalent attachment of an antibody that has a high binding affinity for a protein on the cell wall of S. aureus. Upon interaction with a sample containing S. aureus, binding between the nanoparticles and the bacteria occurred rapidly. A significant reduction in the red coloration of the colloidal nanoparticle suspension, and the formation of a large purple pellet was observed following a brief centrifugation step. Comparison of the absorbance spectra verified the visual observation, demonstrating that there was a significant reduction in the absorbance of the supernatants of reaction samples in which S. aureus was present. This biosensing system provides a rapid means to specifically detect only the targeted organism. Further development will potentially lead to a small, lightweight biosensor that can be easily adapted to detect other selected microorganisms in real-time, providing crews of future spaceflight missions a simple method to autonomously define potential infectious disease risks.</p>* [Three-Axis Gasless Sounding Rocket Payload Attitude Control](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jfmb-2ch4) - <p>Gas released by current sounding rocket payload attitude control systems (ACS) has the potential to interfere with some types of science instruments. A single-axis gasless ACS experiment was successfully flown on a sounding rocket. The single-axis system is being expanded to three axes to provide gasless attitude control with greater accuracy than is presently achievable.</p><p>Sounding rocket payload attitude is currently controlled by a system of cold gas thrusters. The gas released by the thruster has the potential to interfere with science instruments that are sensing matter in the local environment. There is interest in the sounding rocket science community in an ACS that can provide fine attitude control without releasing gas. A three-axis reaction wheel assembly (RWA) can provide gasless fine attitude control during science operations. Large maneuvers and coarse control would still be provided by the standard cold gas thrusters, but the gas would be shut off and control would be handed over to the RWA during portions of the flight critical to sensitive science instruments. In addition to being gasless, a RWA ACS can also provide more precise attitude control than can be achieved through pulsed thrusting of a cold gas system.</p><p>A single-axis gasless ACS proof of concept experiment was flown March 1, 2016.</p><p>The scope of the project is to expand the single-axis system used for the proof of concept flight into a three-axis ACS. Existing software for the controller and software-in-the-loop (SWIL) simulation testing will need to be expanded to include pitch and yaw axes. Maneuver limits and wheel saturation rates with typical disturbances will be estimated to create a trade space of hardware requirements, and hardware that meets those requirements will be identified. Potential processors will be evaluated. Wheels will be sized for the pitch and yaw axes and re-evaluated for the roll axis. Capability for spinning attitude control will also be added. Performance estimates will be made for both the LN-200 and the more accurate LN-251 IRU.</p><p>The overall objective of the project is to mature the three-axis design to the point that it will represent a minimal schedule risk when included in either a Sounding Rocket Program Office (SRPO) development mission or a science mission willing to take a risk on a developmental system, and to develop an accurate cost estimate to aid in securing funding for a flight demonstration.

(LGR) and Professor Martin Fejer and his group at Stanford University propose to develop and demonstrate a compact, monolithic, efficient, high-power, narrow-linewidth tunable laser source operating in the 3.2-3.4 um wavelength region. LGR's mid-infrared (mid-IR) light source, based on a fiber-laser pumped monolithic optical parametric oscillator (OPO) developed at Stanford, will assist NASA in completing its trace-gas-detection objectives by supplying NASA with a critical, difficult-to-obtain laser source suitable for continuous-wave (cw) spectroscopy. During Phase I, LGR and Stanford will manufacture a monolithic OPO crystal, using techniques established by Stanford, generating between 1-2 W of single-frequency radiation between 3.2-3.4 um. At the end of Phase I, the OPO system will be used to measure transmission through a 50-cm-long methane cell (manufactured by LGR) at wavelengths corresponding to the C-H stretch vibrational resonance, 3.3 um. Technology readiness level (TRL) 4 will be reached at the completion of Phase I. During Phase II, remote detection of methane will be performed using a methane cell and measuring the backscattered light from the cell as the OPO mid-IR frequency is scanned ~5 GHz. The size of the housing for the monolithic OPO will be designed to reduce the overall size and weight of the mid-IR-laser head. Fiber-coupling for the incoming pump and the outgoing mid-IR radiation will be added to the OPO housing enabling simple fiber delivery. Modeling of the system sensitivity in ppm of methane will be performed for the final remote sensing system for ground-, air-, and space-based operation.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Time Average 1-hourly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f6t6-w69c) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings.

These orbits are determined sub-daily (ultra-rapid generation), daily (rapid generation), and weekly (final IGS product). The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator retrieves these individual solutions and generates the official IGS combined orbit products.

total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and 

volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. 

(2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined 

using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational 

GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per 

grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional 

economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the 

range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is 

generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia 

University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and 

Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Superconducting Resonant Inductive Power Coupling, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e5by-xv3f) - The proposed effort will develop a technology to wirelessly and efficiently transfer power over hundreds of meters via resonant inductive coupling.  The key innovation of this approach is the use of dielectricless high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils to overcome the limitations in efficiency and range of existing solutions.  This approach is informed by existing research models that predict a nominal application of this technique is capable of delivering 100 Watts of power at a distance of 100 meters with over 90% efficiency.  A notional application of the technology is to deliver power to rovers exploring the inside of craters at the Lunar poles, where solar power is not available.  The naturally low temperatures would eliminate the need for thermal control overhead on the rover, allowing the system to be charged from a completely unenergized state or powered directly.  Multiple rovers could be powered by the same transmission system and there would be no pointing requirements for operation.  The phase I effort will demonstrate efficient wireless power transfer using superconducting wires as a proof of concept (TRL 3-4), which will be integrated with existing thermal control technology (TRL 4) into a working prototype (TRL 6) at the end of Phase II.* [SEDIMENT ANALYSIS NETWORK FOR DECISION SUPPORT (SANDS) LANDSAT GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF AL (GSA) ANALYSIS V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6cjq-rekr) - The Geological Survey of Alabama (GSA) analyzed changes in the coastal shoreline and sedimentation using Landsat geotiff images as part of the Sediment Analysis Network for Decision Support (SANDS) project.

The approach involves direct quantification of controllability of the system via establishing a set of comprehensive physical constraints on trajectory calculations. We develop practical and quantifiable measures of controllability and complexity to facilitate provability of system safety and inform the needs of functional allocation.</p><p>Controlling air traffic on all temporal and spatial scales – from a single aircraft to the entire airspace – can be formally stated as a dynamic, high-dimensional optimization problem with many objectives and constraints based on physics, economics, information, and other considerations. Especially in the future NAS, attempting to find the optimal solution to such problems as they arise during operations would often violate practical constraints such as computation time and/or communication resources. The issue is how to find the best solution subject to such constraints on the solution-finding algorithm. We propose to approach this as a multilevel optimization problem, where a complexity measure F maps the combination of s and an algorithm alpha (e.g., an algorithm that searches over a specified class of fine-grained traffic flows all having a given large-scale flow) to whether applying alpha to s would violate the practical constraints. Given F, the higher level optimization problem identifies the member of a set A of candidate algorithms that has best likely value of the objective functions, subject to provided practical constraints on the algorithm. A lower level optimizer then runs that algorithm and by construction is likely to do so within the given practical constraints. The technical approach will use mathematical programming, Probability Collectives (PC), and Machine Learning (ML), among other areas. The ultimate goal is a methodology and tools for use both in research and as a decision-making aid for all system participants, including aircraft pilots and automatic systems, air traffic controllers, and airlines.</p>* [Multi-Parameter Measurement in Unseeded Flows using Femtosecond Lasers (Tier 1)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3959-38sa) - <p>Measurements in NASA's wind tunnels generally consist of force and moment and on-body measurements like surface pressure, surface deflection or heat transfer to the surface.  Detailed off-body measurements are needed to understand complex wind tunnel flows and to provide data to validate high-fidelity computational models. Most existing techniques capable of measuring detailed off-body flows, for example, particle image velocimetry, require particle or gas seeding which is not possible in many of NASA's tunnels. In this project, two techniques utilizing new femtosecond laser technology will be investigated. Both techniques show promise of measuring multiple parameters quantitatively in unseeded wind tunnel flows. The femtosecond laser electronic excitation and tagging (FLEET) technique can measure velocity and potentially pressure and temperature simultaneously. The femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (FS-CARS) technique can measure pressure, temperature and species concentrations. The two techniques have relative advantages and limitations that will be explored.  The objective of this research project is to leverage recent advancements in laser technology and recent discoveries in academia to discover and apply new ways of measuring aerospace flows. In particular, methods of measuring the gas velocity, pressure, temperature and concentration will be developed. The two different measurement techniques share a common femtosecond laser technology and can be used separately or together to measure multiple gas properties simultaneously in wind tunnel flows and possibly in flight. In this project, we are extending the ability of FLEET to measure multiple parameters such as pressure and temperature simultaneous with velocity.  These additional parameters will be obtained by observing and interpreting the amplitude and spectrum of the FLEET signal.  The main novelty of the proposed work is that FLEET should allow velocity to be measured in several facilities where velocity cannot be curren</p>* [Magnetohydrodynamic-based Laboratories on a Chip for Analysis of Biomolecules, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tnit-uy3c) - A laboratory-on-a-chip design based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) microfluidics and integrated microelectrochemical detection is proposed.  The proposed device is well-suited for the rapid, automatic and highly sensitive detection of a wide variety of biomolecules of potential interest to NASA.  Interest in MHD microfluidic devices has previously been limited by their tendency to generate obstructive bubbles and to suffer quick erosion of the electrodes.  The proposed approach solves these problems and provides for very high flow rates and long electrode lifetimes.  In addition, the proposed device can be operated at very low voltage, and contain no moving parts, features that currently are not available with other forms of microfluidic devices.  In the present approach, the many significant advantages of MHD-based microfluidic systems are retained, including compatibility with a much wider variety of materials and solvents than electrokinetic based systems.  An integrated, self-contained microelectrochemical detection approach can be used in turbid, colored, or complex samples with a minimum or absence of false positives and false negatives.  Together, the two technologies offer a unique platform for biomolecular analysis.  For space applications where minimum sample handling steps and maximum automation are typically highly desired features, the proposed system should excel.* [Innovative Solid State Lighting Replacements for Industrial and Test Facility Locations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cwqe-e8cp) - The proposed innovation is the replacement of existing test stand and parking lot  fixtures with current SSL LED technology. The replacement fixtures will reduce energy consumption, generate less heat and provide maintenance free operation for over 50,000 hours. An explosion-proof fixture is capable of containing an internal combustion event without allowing flames or hot gasses to escape to the surrounding environment. The lighting fixture defined is an explosion-proof fixture for use in hazardous hydrogen/oxygen atmospheres. Current fixtures contain a 110 Watt reflectored incandescent lamp. SSL sources are remarkably efficient compared to incandescent sources. The 110 Watt lamp in existing explosion-proof fixtures will be replaced by an SSL fixture requiring only around 29 Watts for the equivalent lighting output.  The proposed Energy Focus solution will be an efficient, solid-state, explosion-proof  fixture for use in hydrogen/oxygen atmospheres which is compatible with current systems and provides the required lighting distribution. It will do this through advanced thermal and electrical power management to ensure long fixture life* [An On-Chip Nano-Plasmonics Based Urine Protein Assay Cartridge, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/44y7-pwbw) - Long-term exposure to microgravity and radiation during space exploration can pose a critical threat to the health of a flight crew. Real-time monitoring of urine protein levels is an effective way to follow the onset and progress of many diseases and guide the prompt selection of proper therapy. The success of such diagnostic tasks, which are vital for future space missions, critically depends upon the degree of automation, reusability and long-term lifetime of such trace level detection devices. To meet this need, this program will develop a novel on-chip, reagent-free, nano-plasmonic sensor cartridge to concurrently quantify the presence of different urine proteins. The envisioned device is compact, lightweight, fully integrated and automated, and highly cost- and power-effective. In Phase I, a new nano-plasmonics chip technology-based SPR sensor has been developed and successfully demonstrated for protein detection with excellent sensitivity. Critical microfluidic components, used in sample preparation, and adaptable to the sensor chip have been developed and validated by multi-physics-based simulations and modeling. In Phase II, the nano-plasmonic sensor will be optimized to increase sensitivity, stability, and the response to regular urine samples. The sensor chip will be integrated with the system-engineered microfluidics network to form a seamless urine protein assay cartridge (PAC) that enables automated surface modification, sample pretreatment, analyte detection and sensor regeneration for reuse. We will use modular design of the PAC that is compatible with existing NASA astrobiological instruments and will enable high-throughput proteome profiling analysis.* [A Novel, Portable, Projection, Focusing Schlieren System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/prwb-pby4) - The schlieren technique has been used for flow diagnostics in wind tunnels since the beginning of aerospace research, due to its ability to make airflows -- especially shock waves and turbulence -- visible. This proposal describes a novel type of schlieren system that would increase efficiency, capability, and productivity for ground test facilities. The concept and the availability of state of the art components make the system more portable, easier to align, and more versatile than existing systems. A major drawback of current schlieren systems and one that has restricted their widespread commercial use is that they require exact alignment between a pair of widely separated mirrors or grids, which takes time and limits portability, and costs are prohibitive for most such applications. This problem is partially relaxed by focusing schlieren methods. The proposed concept incorporates features of existing schlieren systems while removing the primary limitations. All of the elements that require precise alignment are contained within a camera body and can be relatively inexpensive. Also, very large fields of view are made possible.  This is advantageous in wind tunnel facilities, since experiments are frequently installed only to be torn down shortly afterwards.* [Enabling Technologies for Fabrication of Large Area Flexible Antennas, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3zqp-in2i) - Flexible, foldable, and/or inflatable antenna systems open up a wealth of opportunities.  Integrating antenna elements and related electronics onto flexible substrates, however, poses significant challenges.  To our knowledge, there exists no technology that can incorporate a variety of electronic/sensor materials onto large-area flexible substrates to create flexible and conformable circuits in an economical and reliable way.  The majority of the limitations stem from processing techniques.  Mesoscribe Technologies, a high tech start-up from SUNY-Stony Brook, proposes to apply a breakthrough new direct writing technology to meet the objectives set-forth in the NASA SBIR topic S2.06 Advanced Flexible Electronics.  This technology is based on revolutionary advances to modern day thermal spray materials processing enables deposition of wide range of electronic materials onto large areas at low processing temperatures and, for most part, requires no post-processing.  The Phase I effort focused on demonstrating proof-of-concept to deposit conducting microstrip lines and sensors on flexible substrates.  The Phase II program will be focused exclusively on developing a Direct-Write-Thermal-Spray based large-area patterning capability that is based on roll-to-roll processing to fabricate large-area antennas on flexible substrates, focusing, in particular, on JPL's L-band membrane-based active phased array radar.* [A Model-based Avionic Prognostic Reasoner (MAPR)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mkuh-9bfp) - The Model-based Avionic Prognostic Reasoner (MAPR) presented in this paper is an
innovative solution for non-intrusively monitoring the state of health (SoH) and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of electronic and electromechanical assets by accessing and processing data obtained from a standard avionics data bus. To support Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring (IVHM) initiatives, the solution being described here has been designed to be as non-intrusive as possible. An innovative, model-driven anomaly diagnostic and fault characterization system for electromechanical actuator (EMA) systems was developed to mitigate potentially catastrophic faults. EMA systems are used in a wide variety of aircraft applications to control critical components such as control surfaces, landing gear and thrust vector control. Failure in any one of these systems can compromise passenger safety, as well as mission success. A MIL-STD-1553 bus interface and monitor were designed to extract environmental (e.g., altitude, air speed, air density) and operational (i.e., response of system to a commanded change) data of a representative EMA system and to determine whether an anomaly is detected, and the corresponding severity. The MIL-STD-1553 bus was chosen as the test bed to develop this approach, due to its large installed base and availability of compatible development tools. Advanced and unique reasoning methodologies are applied to the extracted data sets to provide anomaly detection and fault classification on various fault modes and eventually yield SoH and RUL. In this paper we describe a data monitoring unit that will, in real time, identify, isolate, and characterize faults and establish their severity so that major performance problems can be alleviated. When built, this system will consist of a laptop with a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) card slot that can accept multiple interfaces to the MAPR software package. The MAPR package will be designed to be adaptable for a large number of different platforms, for portability and for maximum input data type flexibility. This paper describes a ground-based prototype of the technology to show the efficacy of the method.* [Global Soil Texture and Derived Water-Holding Capacities (Webb et al.)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mvks-hu9x) - A standardized global data set of soil horizon thicknesses and textures (particle size distributions).* [LBA-ECO LC-18 Hyperion 30-m Surface Reflectance, Mato Grosso, Brazil: July 2004](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ajxn-7jxb) - This image was collected by the Hyperion sensor on 10-July-2004 at 13:16:16 GMT.  It was calibrated to apparent surface reflectance using the ACORN atmospheric model.The Hyperion imager has a spectral range of 400-2500 nm, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, spatial resolution of 30 m, and a swath width of 7.8 km. Sampling is scene based (256 samples, 512 lines) (http://eo1.usgs.gov/sensors.php).  Through these large number of spectral bands, complex land ecosystems can be imaged and accurately classified.Data from the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer may greatly increase our ability to estimate the presence and structural attributes of selective logging in the Amazon Basin using four biogeophysical indicators not yet derived simultaneously from any satellite sensor: 1) green canopy leaf area index; 2) degree of shadowing; 3) presence of exposed soil and; 4) non-photosynthetic vegetation material. Airborne, field and modeling studies have shown that the optical reflectance continuum (400-2500 nm) contains sufficient information to derive estimates of each of these indicators. Our ongoing studies in the eastern Amazon basin also suggest that these four indicators are sensitive to logging intensity. Satellite-based estimates of these indicators should provide a means to quantify both the presence and degree of structural disturbance caused by various logging regimes.* [An Optical Wake Vortex Detection System for Super-Density Airport Operation, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qg4y-r8th) - Feasibility study including analysis and experiment performed in Phase I indicated that several singled-ended optical scintillometer and retro-reflector pairs installed on towers or poles are able to develop a vertical profile of near ground atmospheric turbulence and wind measurements in airport environment.  In Phase II, OSI proposes to design, fabricate and test a prototype optical vertical profile system for atmospheric turbulence and crosswind measurements to provide critical atmospheric parameters for wake vortex decaying forecasting modeling.  Several scintillometers will be built with the goal to demonstrate their ability to meet performance, size, weight, and packaging requirements for airport operations. An analytical and field test program will be conducted for further performance improvement of a vertical profile vortex detection system using optical scintillometers to measure near ground level crosswind, turbulence, and wake vortex on an airfield.  The results of  near ground vortex measurements plus the ground vortex measurements by double-ended optical scintillometers will provide the necessary assessment to design a crosswind, turbulence, and vortex detection system as a decision support tool for NASA's Airspace Systems (AS) Program to improve airport capacity and safety.
 
The vortex detection system could also measure downdraft on the runway. The instrument will provide real-time continuous measurements of convergence and divergence along the runway. Vertical winds, and hence the downdraft, can be derived from the measured divergence. The proposed vortex detection system will also be able to provide critical large area wind information. By incorporating this valuable information into the low-level wind shear modeling, it will greatly enhance the performance of the present airport low-level wind shear systems.* [MOPITT Gridded Daily CO Retrievals (Near Infrared Radiances) V006](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cgpp-5pgk) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals. The averaging kernels associated with each retrieval are also gridded and included in the L3 files. For a description of the file contents, refer to the File Spec Document.

The fire detection strategy is based on absolute detection of a fire (when the fire strength is sufficient to detect), and on detection relative to its background (to account for variability of the surface temperature and reflection by sunlight). Numerous tests are employed to reject typical false alarm sources like sun glint or an unmasked coastline.

MOD14 is level-2 swath data provided daily at 1-kilometer resolution. The Science Data Sets in this product include fire-mask, algorithm quality, radiative power, and numerous layers describing fire pixel attributes.

The Terra MODIS instrument acquires data twice daily (10:30 AM and PM), as does the Aqua MODIS (1:30 PM and AM). These four daily MODIS fire observations serve to advance global monitoring of the fire process and its effects on ecosystems, the atmosphere, and climate.

Version-5 MODIS Thermal Anomalies & Fire products have attained Validation Stage 3, which was completed using active fire reference data that were derived from ASTER and Landsat-5 TM (30 m resolution) data sources.

Change Points of Interest

Current RNA preparation methods are tedious, require substantial astronaut time, and necessitate exposure to toxic chemicals. They often have poor, unreliable yields due to RNase contamination. Our overall objective is to develop and commercialize a microfluidics based miniaturized platform (MED-RNA) that can fully automate the complex process of RNA extraction. Starting from harvested whole mammalian cells in a culture medium, MED-RNA will lyse, capture, extract/isolate and freeze/store RNA content for later analysis, in a fully integrated fashion with minimal user intervention. In addition to higher yields and faster process times, losses and contamination will be minimized as a result of the miniaturization and automation. A novel and unique plastic card based fabrication technology from Micronics Corp. will be leveraged for low-cost microfabrication. In Phase I, we will develop detailed design for the microfluidic lab card and the integrated system. We will also fabricate and demonstrate critical components (lysis and capture) of MED-RNA. The design process will be based on the state-of-the-art, multiphysics biochip design software from CFDRC. In Phase II, a fully integrated microfluidic lab card (including storage) will be developed and demonstrated on chosen cell lines.* [Adaptive Digital Pre-distorter for Higher-Order Modulation Nonlinearities and Data Jitter](https://data.nasa.gov/d/drg8-84gw) - <p>Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the adoption of variable coding &amp; modulation (VCM); and adaptive coding &amp; modulation (ACM) for the communication systems of near-Earth satellites.&nbsp; These spectral efficient techniques increase data rates by utilizing the available link margins and pairing various channel coding schemes with higher-order modulations, but have a number of implementation and performance challenges.&nbsp; We propose to develop an adaptive digital pre-distorter modulator that would overcome these challenges.&nbsp; Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the adoption of variable coding &amp; modulation (VCM); and adaptive coding &amp; modulation (ACM) for the communication systems of near-Earth satellites.&nbsp; These spectral efficient techniques increase data rates by utilizing the available link margins and pairing various channel coding schemes with higher-order modulations, but have a number of implementation and performance challenges.&nbsp; We propose to develop an adaptive digital pre-distorter that would overcome these challenges.</p><p>The Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has adopted two VCM/ACM systems, Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB-S2) and Serially Concatenated Convolutional Coding (SCCC), but the fundamental concept of VCM/ACM can be applied to existing sets of CCSDS protocols, such as Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes with higher order modulations.&nbsp; These systems try to operate with all available link margins while maintaining a constrained bandwidth, by increasing data rates through the use of various channel coding and modulation combinations.</p><p>Fundamentally, higher-order modulations are heavily sensitive to channel distortions, producing large losses in link performance and power efficiency.&nbsp; The distortions are typically handled by pre-distortion of the waveforms prior to the amplifier, with one of the most practical approaches being the application of a static inversion of the measured amplifier characteristics.&nbsp; However, these pre-distortion approaches have limited capability due in part to improper characterization of the amplifier response or the limitation in the pre-distortion algorithm.&nbsp; Typically, manufacturers&rsquo; input amplitude modulation to output amplitude modulation (AM/AM) and input amplitude modulation to output phase modulation (AM/PM) curves are measured with a single tone radio frequency carrier that is varied in power.&nbsp; However, the data modulated transmitted signal is dynamic, with a spectrum of side tones across the bandwidth.&nbsp; The non-linearity will produce intermodulation products that are not considered in these measurements, thus designing a pre-distorter with these measurements is inaccurate and will produce a large penalty in the error performance of the link.</p><p>Alternatively, the input drive level of the amplifier can be backed off to minimize nonlinearities.&nbsp; However, as the order of the modulation increases, so does the amount of backed off power.&nbsp; Having a transmitter operating with a large amount of required input back off translates into a tremendous amount of direct current (DC) power required on the spacecraft to support these modulations.</p><p>The objective of this proposal is to develop an adaptive digital pre-distorter that can overcome the challenge of requiring excessively high DC power for higher-order modulations that are required for high-data rates links, e.g. VCM/ACM links.&nbsp; In addition, the fundamental approach can also be applied to mitigate phase noise by reducing symbol-to-symbol jitter.&nbsp; The advantages of digital pre-distortion are that the dynamic and memory behavior of the AM/AM can be measured in real-time while the adaptive algorithm can mitigate these effects to a designed precision based on a learning algorithm.&nbsp; Therefore we can effectively eliminate any distortions created by the amplifier.</p>* [CubeSat Storage and Communications Card](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wnwh-q539) - <p>Science and housekeeping data generated on a CubeSat can be collected for hours or days between opportunities to downlink, but each downlink window provides only a few minutes of time to transfer this data to the ground.&nbsp; Most transceivers which handle this task provide little buffering of this data, and when the C&amp;DH processor has a slower serial link it limits the effective downlink rate of the transceiver.&nbsp; An integrated onboard mass storage and transceiver interface card would mitigate this limitation and allow downlink rates at the maximum rate of the transceiver while allowing the C&amp;DH to forward downlink data over a slower serial interface.</p>* [High Temperature "Smart" P3 Sensors and Electronics for Distributed Engine Control, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jrpz-bbee) - Current engine control architectures impose limitations on the insertion of new control capabilities due to weight penalties and reliability issues related to complex wiring harnesses. NASA in collaboration with Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) has been conducting research in developing technologies to enable Distributed Engine Control (DEC) architectures. Realization of such future intelligent engines depends on the development of both hardware and software, including high temperature electronics and sensors to make smart components. NASA is particularly interested in the design and development of these applications for assessing the benefit they bring to the engine system. Compressor discharge pressure measurement has long been a key aspect of turbine engine control to manage stall margin. Given that, there is a need for a high-temperature, smart P3 sensor as a key building block for distributed engine controls. Given the current limitations of high temperature electronics, the business case for smart control elements (sensors and actuators) can be made in the fan/compressor section of the engine. The long-term objective of the proposed effort is to advance high-temperature P3 sensor technology for DEC applications through working with OEM partners and industry working groups to: (1) to iterate the current technology toward DEC formats/functions, (2) advance the digital electronics design/firmware and high temperature electronics, and (3) (through demonstration and stakeholder collaboration) present the viability (technical and business case) of the proposed sensor.* [Micro-atmospheric Microwell Plate Technology Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/52ic-2g3u) - <p>Valuable research in gravitational biology, synthetic biology, proteomics, and biotechnology can be enhanced by using microwell platforms. The microwell platform provides a simple technique for doing massively parallel studies.&nbsp; However, to be effectively used in microgravity significant improvements in our ability to manage gases in these systems is needed. We are developing a system that addresses these limitations.&nbsp; This research enables a wide range foundational research in Space Synthetic Biology, Fundamental Space Biology, and Astrobiology, ultimately generating the knowledge required to engineer a potentially broad range of space biotechnology applications employing synthetic organisms and microbial bioreactors for in situ resource utilization and biological life support systems.</p> <p>Microwell-plates have become standardized formats for biological research. However, valuable biological microgravity research cannot be accomplished using these technologies without improvements in our ability to deliver, remove, and measure gases.</p><p>In microgravity, where buoyancy driven mixing is minimal, the buildup of CO<sub>2</sub> in solutions containing aerobic bacteria can adversely impact growth rates and mask more subtle effects. Likewise, the delivery of O<sub>2</sub> and removal of metabolic by-products at the bottom of a microwell in microgravity is difficult to achieve and even more difficult to measure.&nbsp; Gas that builds up and is not removed will supersaturate the growth medium and form bubbles causing interference with detection and analysis.</p><p>What is needed is a standard microwell-plate that is sealed with a transparent cover slip and has the capability to control, mix, and measure gas concentrations inside the microwells. To accomplish this requires the integration of a range of state-of-the-art micro and nano technologies such as micro-sensors that measure gas concentrations of O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H2S, NO and some organics.&nbsp; Also needed are technologies that add O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> to micro-atmospheres; remove CO<sub>2</sub>, NO, H<sub>2</sub>S, and organics; as well as micro-technologies that can control gas mixing, and gas circulation in micro-atmospheres.</p><p>This CIF grant developed an initial feasibility study of a sealed micro well that can measure and control the micro atmosphere contained in individual micro wells.&nbsp; This system uses carbon nanotube sensors to measure gas concentrations at a nano scale within the microwell.&nbsp; Gas phase adsorbents are used as gas reservoirs to add and remove atmospheric/metabolic gases from the well.&nbsp; Micro pumps and valves are used to circulate gases and insure good mixing in the well.</p>* [Monthly Climate Data for Selected USGS HCDN Sites, 1951-1990](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ycu5-pde9) - Time series of monthly minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were derived for 1337 watersheds in the conterminous United States for sites found in the national streamflow database, termed the hydroclimatologic data network (HCDN), developed by Slack et al. (1993a,b). Estimates were derived for the years 1951-1990.This HCDN data set consists of records of average daily streamflow at 1553 sites located throughout the United States. The data meet certain measurement accuracy criterion outlined by Slack et al. (1993). The HCDN contains river flows from 1874 to 1988, with an average record length of 44 years. The streamflow data included in the HCDN is purported to be relatively free from anthropogenic influences and the accuracy ratings of these records are at least rated good per USGS standards. A subset of the HCDN streamflow sites from 1337 watersheds with at least 10 years of record length was used. This subset includes 1376 HCDN sites.The climate characteristic estimates of temperature and precipitation were estimated using the PRISM (Daly et al. 1994, 1997) climate analysis system as described in Vogel, et al. 1999.Estimates of monthly potential evaporation were obtained using a method introduced by Hargreaves and Samani (1982) which is based on monthly time series of average minimum and maximum temperature data along with extraterrestrial solar radiation. Extraterrestrial solar radiation was estimated for each HCDN basin by computing the solar radiation over 0.1 degree grids using the method introduced by Duffie and Beckman (1980) and then summing those estimates for each river basin. This process is described in Sankarasubramanian, Vogel, and Limbrunner, 2001.The data files are organized in directories by parameter, Tmax, Tmin, Pre, and PET, and contain 18 subdirectories representing the 18 HCDN regions. Each region subdirectory contains data files for the monthly time series of respective hydroclimate attributes (Tmax, Tmin, Precipitation, and PET) for the individual HCDN sites in that region for the years 1951-1990. All files are in space delimited ASCII format.* [NACP Site: Terrestrial Biosphere Model and Aggregated Flux Data in Standard Format](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8ajf-ja3f) - This data set provides standardized output variables for gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), leaf area index (LAI), ecosystem respiration (Re), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H) from 24 terrestrial biosphere models for 47 eddy covariance flux tower sites in North America. Each model used standardized input data for each flux tower site (i.e., gap-filled, locally observed weather; land use history; and other site specific data) and followed standard model setup and spinup procedures. The files also contain gap-filled observations and total uncertainty estimates. The data set was compiled for the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Synthesis for use in model inter-comparison and assessment of how well the models simulate carbon processes across vegetation types and environmental conditions in North America. There is one compressed (.zip) file with this data set. When expanded, the .zip file contains model output data for one variable at one site. The model output and observations are available at the native half-hourly time step, or in daily, monthly, and annual aggregations, in comma-separated text (.csv) format.* [Multi-axis Attitude Control and Energy Storage on Small Satellites](https://data.nasa.gov/d/98gp-3gef) - <p>To fully-enable cutting edge science through small satellites (smallsat), this technology will reduce the overall size and net power consumption of conventional three-axis attitude control systems.<p/><p>A CubeSat is a volume-limited, standardized smallsat form factor (typ. 1-6U, where 1U = 10 cm3) that occasionally needs to be equipped with an active attitude control system, e.g. reaction wheels needed for high-resolution science imaging, orbit maintenance, and maximum irradiance on solar cells. The proposed architecture provides improved performance over traditional wheels and satisfies the push for component miniaturization, increased pointing accuracy, and power efficiency on CubeSats.</p>* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 Total Column Ozone Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2xky-hn2z) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 Total Column Ozone Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

The work will address the following limitations of most commercially available FMS: they have limited advanced features; are specific to a single aircraft type; and cannot be readily modified by researchers. The proposed research will identify and extend advanced FMS features for the simulation evaluation of 4DTBO concepts in different phases of flight, based on the feasibility demonstration during Phase I work. Some of proposed feature include (i) advanced 4D guidance modes such as Required Time of Arrival (RTA), 4DFMS, and Interval Management (IM), (ii) high-fidelity wind modeling and wind update capability for improved predictability, (iii) trajectory negotiation, (iv) optimal 4D trajectory planning. Phase II work will develop a generic FMS interface to NASA's Multi-Aircraft Control System (MACS) to enable the evaluation of FMS modules from multiple vendors in 4DTBO simulations. The proposed FMS platform and the generic FMS interface will allow the users to deploy a wide array of autonomy enabling FMS features through a Graphical User Interface. All the algorithms and software developed under this research will be delivered to NASA at the end of the project.* [mREST: Flexible Open Interface Standard for Test and Launch Operations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nrbw-7eb9) - Spaceflight systems must pass through a complex set of testing and processing before being cleared for launch.  A significant portion of the pre-launch processing involves integration with other flight systems, general ground support equipment, and test equipment.  The process of interfacing this equipment has historically been a source of numerous delays and unplanned work prior to launch.  The proliferation of different interface types, designs, and manufacturers only serves to increase the difficulties associated with pre-launch integration and testing.The development and adoption of improved, standardized interfaces holds the potential of reducing the cost and complexity of the testing and launch processing processes and could provide eventual benefits to autonomous servicing in future space missions.  In-space and surface servicing of multiple types of spacecraft becomes more feasible if a common interface approach can be developed and widely adopted.

In 2012, METECS developed the mREST Architecture and Interface Specification  and began developing software prototypes that could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the standard for the automation of testing in flight laboratories at the NASA/Johnson Space Center.  This specification and the associated software became collectively known simply as "mREST".

The proposed innovation is to expand on the mREST foundational work to design an interface standard that can be utilized to solve the issues associated with test and launch operations.  This will be accomplished by first doing research into the specific issues that typically arise during the pre-launch process and identifying areas where the existing mREST specification should be expanded and/or refined.* [Microwave Detection of Laser Ultrasonic for Non-Destructive Testing, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/psyd-zfz3) - In this proposal, we describe a program to develop a high-performance, cost-effective and robust microwave receiver prototype for multi-purpose Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE). Currently, NDE of space transportation vehicles is primarily carried out on the ground, between missions.  For future space missions, as duration and frequency increases, more inspection will need to be performed in space in order to monitor the aging process of the structure and to insure its integrity. For this purpose, NDE equipment that is compact, lightweight, easily operated by human with limited mobility or robot, and that exhibits low power consumption is required. Furthermore, in order to minimize the quantity of embarked equipment, the inspection equipment must be able to perform as many different inspection tasks as possible. Our innovative receiver is based on the integration of a microwave interferometer coupled with a pulsed laser to generate the ultrasound. . Based on the results obtained during Phase 1, we strongly think that we will be able to overcome the limitation generally associated with classical optical receiver: 1) Inability to work in factory environment where thermal, mechanical and optical propagation (fumes, water drops,..) perturbations are present; 2) Reduction in sensitivity caused by the speckle nature of the light reflected from rough surfaces; 3) High system cost due the price of the probe lasers, optics and engineering to develop an optical system working in a harsh environment (fumes, water drops, strong mechanical vibration) and 4) high maintenance cost (Lasers and optics need to be checked and re-aligned frequently). Our proposed approach will lead to a cost-effective prototype with good sensitivity and performances in industrial environment.* [Scalable Architectures for Distributed Beam-Forming Synthetic Aperture Radar (DBSAR), Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mkr3-ntq7) - Conventional SAR operates in the Stripmap mode. Wide unambiguous swath coverage and high azimuth resolution pose contradictory requirements on the design of SAR systems. A promising technique to overcome this limitation is Digital Beam-Forming (DBF) on receive where the receiving antenna is split into multiple sub-apertures. This provides the capability of forming multiple beams via post-processing. DBF techniques applied to SAR systems can increase receiving antenna gain without a reduction of the imaged area and suppress interference signals. A highly capable DBSAR instrument design would consist of wideband Transmitter-Receiver Module (TRM), precise multi-channel timing and synchronization and reconfigurable processing engine that can host the SAR processing, calibration and control routines. IAI?s proposed approach is modular, scalable and meets the NASA goals of developing an innovative analog/digital hardware design for the implementation of distributed DBSAR architectures.* [Design of Laser-Based Remote Sensing Instrument for Measuring Ocean Temperature and Salinity Depth Profiles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nakv-537h) - <p>We propose to design an instrument with the capability to measure both temperature and salinity profiles of ocean mixed layers.&nbsp; We will design the key elements of the instrument including receiver design, measurement and detection schemes, laser transmitter characteristics, and overall link margin.&nbsp; Our plan is to create an instrument design that can potentially measure seawater salinity and vertical temperature profiles utilizing Brillouin and Raman scattering.&nbsp;</p><p>The objectives of the proposed instrument design effort are as follows:</p><p><em>(a)</em>&nbsp; Evaluating various Raman and Brillouin scattering techniques and determining how much information can likely be derived from them, and how well they could be incorporated into an aircraft instrument.</p><p><em>(b)</em>&nbsp; Determining link margins for potential Raman and Brillouin detection schemes, and defining crucial laser parameters including pulse width, repetition rate, pulse energy, and laser wavelength.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(c)</em>&nbsp; Designing a receiver system that can utilize the preferred scattering detection scheme(s).&nbsp; Also included in receiver design are calculations of required telescope FOV, optical throughput, coupling, and detector efficiency.</p><p><em>(d)</em>&nbsp; Design of laser transmitter &amp; hardware to meet instrument detection scheme requirements.</p><p>The science product of the proposed instrument is vertical profiles of water column temperature and salinity with 1 m resolution obtained from collected Brillouin and Raman scattering spectra. &nbsp;This is an early-stage innovation that would seek further funding for hardware development at the conclusion of this design effort.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>* [Core Flight Software for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tknr-s8n2) - Use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) is increasing worldwide, but multiple technical barriers restrict the greater use of UASs. The safe operation of UASs in the National Airspace (NAS) will require the vehicle to equipped with sophisticated avionics and flight software. The cost of verifying the flight software required for safe operation is a tremendous barrier to the growth of the technology. Windhover Labs intends to port NASAs Core Flight Software (CFS) to a UAS platform, and use new techniques and tools to lower flight software verification costs. This will provide a safe platform for UAS technology expansion. Windhover Labs intends to extend the existing safety critical pedigree of CFS to UASs. We will develop all the UAS platform specific applications and integrate them into a UAS avionics package. Windhover Labs will certify the CFS framework so application developers need only focus on the verification of their applications. With the basic UAS platform certification taken care of, UAS users can focus on their specific needs like precision agriculture, aerial survey, product delivery, etc. CFS is built around a software bus which allows for straightforward addition of this application specific software. Windhover Labs will also create an embedded test agent. This agent will provide an automated test engine that has access to all the application interfaces. This embedded agent provides an interface and execution platform for application developers to write effective verification tests. Innovative ground control software will enable automating the execution of these tests and the collecting of necessary verification evidence. The CFS framework is a perfect fit for powering the future of UASs in the NAS. Windhover Labs believes that providing this safety critical flight software framework and verification tools tailored for that framework lowers the technology barrier so many new UAS applications can be brought to market affordably.* [The Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI): Update &amp; Second Launch Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hijg-4bfn) - &lt;p&gt;
	Particle acceleration in solar flares and its contribution to coronal heating are among the main&amp;nbsp; unsolved problems in heliophysics. Accelerated electrons in a plasma radiate hard X-ray (HXR)&amp;nbsp; emission through the well-known process of bremsstrahlung. HXR observations therefore are a&amp;nbsp; powerful diagnostic tool, providing quantitative measurements of flare-accelerated electrons. Since&amp;nbsp; bremsstrahlung emission depends on the density of the ambient medium, solar HXR emission is&amp;nbsp; usually brightest from below the transition region, where the density increases rapidly towards the&amp;nbsp; photosphere. Electron beams entering the chromosphere lose energy quickly through collisions and&amp;nbsp; produce relatively intense HXR emission at the footpoints of magnetic field lines. Electron beams&amp;nbsp; moving in the relatively tenuous corona suffer very few collisions, losing little energy and producing&amp;nbsp; only faint HXR emission. Present-day HXR instrumentation does not have the sensitivity to see&amp;nbsp; faint HXR emission from electrons traveling in the corona, nor the dynamic range to see such&amp;nbsp; faint emission in the presence of bright HXR footpoint emission in the chromosphere. Existing&amp;nbsp; observations therefore show us only where energetic electrons are stopped, but not where they&amp;nbsp; are accelerated, nor along what path they escape from the acceleration site. The most sensitive&amp;nbsp; solar HXR observations so far are provided by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Spectroscopic&amp;nbsp; Imager (RHESSI) (Lin et al. 2002). These measurements are obtained with a non-focusing rotation&amp;nbsp; modulation collimator (RMC) imaging technique (Hurford et al. 2002). RMCs and other types&amp;nbsp; of non-focusing imaging, however, have intrinsically limited dynamic range and sensitivity. HXR&amp;nbsp; focusing optics can overcome both of these limitations (Section 1.2.2).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) is a sounding rocket payload funded under the&amp;nbsp; NASA Low Cost Access to Space (LCAS) program to test HXR focusing optics combined with&amp;nbsp; silicon strip detectors for solar observations (Krucker et al. 2009). The FOXSI program is being led&amp;nbsp; by the Space Sciences Laboratory at UC Berkeley in collaboration with the Marshall Space Flight&amp;nbsp; Center (MSFC) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). FOXSI is on schedule&amp;nbsp; and on budget for a launch in October 2010. FOXSI will offer imaging spectroscopy and&amp;nbsp; unprecedented HXR sensitivity and dynamic range. FOXSI will be !100 times more sensitive than&amp;nbsp; RHESSI at 10 keV, and, for the first time, detect the non-thermal counterparts of quiet sun network&amp;nbsp; flares (Section 1.2.4).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here we propose a continuation of the FOXSI program which includes data analysis&amp;nbsp; and a second flight with an upgraded version of FOXSI. At moderate cost, we propose to&amp;nbsp; enhance the effective area, in particular at higher energies (by a factor of !4 at 15 keV), by adding&amp;nbsp; 3 more shells to the existing 7-shell optics (see Figure 9). Furthermore, our Japanese collaborators&amp;nbsp; will provide, at no cost, newly available double-sided cadmium telluride (CdTe) detectors as&amp;nbsp; a replacement for the Si detectors to allow us to take full advantage of the effective area at higher&amp;nbsp; energies. A second flight will therefore not only allow us to continue testing HXR focusing&amp;nbsp; optics for solar observations and also test newly developed CdTe strip detectors&amp;nbsp; in flight but is also expected to provide a significant increase in scientific return. In&amp;nbsp; this two year proposal, the first year (2011) will be used to upgrade the FOXSI payload and to&amp;nbsp; analyze data from the first flight, while the second flight is planned for the midd* [MOPITT Beta CO gridded daily means (Near Infrared Radiances) V107](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8vxh-8dm4) - The MOPITT Beta L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals and belong to an unvalidated beta product subject to recalibration. The averaging kernels associated with each retrieval are also gridded and included in the L3 files. For a description of the file contents, refer to the File Spec Document. Please see the MOPITT L2 Data Quality Statement for additional information about the quality and the limitations of the retrievals. [From the MOPITT V3 Level 3 Data Quality Summary] Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) was successfully launched into sun-synchronous polar orbit aboard Terra, NASA's first Earth Observing System spacecraft on December 18, 1999. The MOPITT instrument was constructed by a consortium of Canadian companies and funded by the Space Science Division of the Canadian Space Agency.* [Health-Management Driven Control Reconfiguration Approach for Flight Vehicles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/we93-gkx5) - A prognostic system makes it possible to anticipate loss of functionality before it occurs with sufficient lead time to take actions that mitigate the impact of this loss. We focus on the forms of mitigation within the flight vehicle that influence the operational dynamics but do not directly amend the mission plan. Thus, we focus upon the reconfiguration of the feedback control strategy for the flight system.

The high degree of complexity in the design and dynamics of modern aircraft is typically handled using a hierarchical control scheme in which there are several levels of control at increasing levels of responsibility: the component level, the subsystem level, and the system level. Our reconfiguration strategy involves mitigating problems that are detected at the component level at both the level in which the fault is detected and higher levels as well. There are, thus, two subproblems to the reconfiguration: (a) an adaptive control problem at the lower level to extend component life and derive new component performance limits, and (b) a supervisory control problem at the higher level to adapt the system controller to maximize system capability while respecting the performance limitations. Since our reconfiguration occurs in the context of a dynamic system, we need to respect the stability implications of the reconfiguration. To address this, we apply bandwidth analyses at the component level and the systems level in a robust performance context. A conservative criterion for stability is to impose rate limits for reconfiguration that insure that undesired, and possibly unmodeled, modes of behavior are not driven by reconfiguration activities. For specific hardware, extensions beyond this conservative approach may be warranted (e.g. to catch faulty behavior) and validated on a case-by-case basis, essentially by extending the component modeling to include a model of behavior under certain types of reconfiguration.* [A Novel Technology for Simultaneous TOC Reduction and Biofouling Prevention, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qxv8-nghh) - Recycling of water using biological processes is a primary goal of NASA's advanced life support programs. This proposal concerns a technology to simultaneously reduce the microbial count (MC) and total organic carbon (TOC) content of biological water processor (BWP) effluent. This technology is based on an advanced oxidation process using an on-demand oxidizer generator, which does not require consumable chemicals. Phase I feasibility studies successfully demonstrated the efficacy of the process for the reduction of both TOC and MC of the BWP processed water. Independent evaluation of the technology at a well known technological university successfully demonstrated the efficacy of the process for minimizing the RO membrane fouling. The residual disinfectant and reduced TOC in the treated effluent minimize fouling the RO membrane and water lines. In addition, reduced TOC lowers the load on equipment downstream to the BWP, enabling a reduction in the equivalent system mass. In the Phase II project, a prototype will be fabricated and evaluated for its ability to reduce TOC, MC and extend RO membrane life in a technological university having a small scale water reclamation system similar to that at NASA-JSC. The GEN I unit developed will be delivered to NASA-JSC.* [Global Soil Texture and Derived Water-Holding Capacities (Webb et al.)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gu66-figh) - ABSTRACT: A standardized global data set of soil horizon thicknesses and textures (particle size distributions).* [Fusion of Inertial Navigation and Imagery Data, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wt2g-pa9e) - The innovations of the Fusion of Inertial Navigation and Imagery Data are the application of the concept to the dynamic entry-interface through near-landing phases, the autonomy and (near) real-time requirements of the system, and the focus on satisfying the stringent requirements for reliability and verification for spaceflight. This innovation will allow spacecraft to navigate autonomously, precisely and safely from entry-interface to near-landing. 

The plan is to develop automated techniques suitable for onboard software that incorporate recognized objects from imagery data into the vehicle's navigated solution. We will use image processing techniques to compare the imagery with expected views, pattern recognition techniques to identify known objects in the comparison, mechanisms for locating known objects using the navigated state, and filtering techniques to update the navigated state with the errors between the observed and expected results. To qualify as flight software, the proposed solution will be reliable and verifiable, and will satisfy limitations of the onboard equipment. No existing techniques solve all of these problems. Current techniques for incorporating imagery data into navigated solutions use sensors that have significantly shorter ranges, rely on registration markers placed on the target, use ground-based computational equipment, or require human intervention to arrive at a solution.* [LBA Regional Monthly Climatology for the 20th Century (New et al.)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a96f-tk2i) - This data set is a subset of "Global Monthly Climatology for the 20th Century (New et al.)" (2000a). This subset characterizes mean monthly surface climate over the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., latitude 10 N to 25 S, longitude 30 to 85 W) during nearly all of the 20th Century. The data are gridded at 0.5-degree latitude/longitude resolution and include seven variables: precipitation, mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure, cloud cover, and ground-frost frequency. All variables have mean monthly values for the period 1901-1995, several have data as recent as 1998, and further data will be added by the data originators. In constructing the monthly grids, the authors used an anomaly approach that attempts to maximize station data in space and time (New et al. 2000b). In this technique, grids of monthly historic anomalies are derived in relation to a standard normal period. Station measurement data for the years 1961-1990 were extracted from the monthly data holdings of the Climatic Research Unit and the Global Historic Climatology Network (GHCN) and used in constructing the normal period (New et al. 1999). The anomaly grids were then combined with high-resolution mean monthly climatology to arrive at fields of estimated historical monthly surface climate. Data are in ASCII GRID format for ArcInfo. Information on creating this LBA subset is available in ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/physical_climate/GIS_EastAngliaClimateMonthly/comp/eastanglia_readme.pdf.Data users are encouraged to see the companion file New et al. (2000) for a complete description of this technique and potential applications and limitations of the data set. For additional information, refer to the IPCC Data Distribution Centre.To access the complete year-by-year monthly data set or data more recent than posted here, users may make a request with the Climate Impacts LINK Project at the Climatic Research Unit (e-mail: d.viner@uea.ac.uk; web site: www.cru.uea.ac.uk/link). LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system. More information about LBA can be found at http://www.daac.ornl.gov/LBA/misc_amazon.html.* [High Performance Ka-band Phase Shifters for Space Telecommunications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/krkw-7x7d) - We propose a novel MEMS-based digital phase shifter targeted for Ka-band operation, but scalable down to X-band and up to W-band.  This novel phase shifter will incorporate MEMtronics' state-of-the-art microencapsulated, capacitive MEMS switches to control phase.  The envisioned phase shifter behaves much like a switched-line phase shifter with broadband matched impedance, but without sacrificing size normally needed to accommodate multiple signal paths.  Many MEMS-based phase shifters have been created with good results utilizing a loaded line approach.  While this technique works well for smaller bits, larger bits suffer from narrow bandwidths and a poor impedance match in one or both states.  Additionally, cascading multiple bits results in a relatively long multi-bit phase shifter.  As insertion loss is dominated by conductor loss, these long multi-bit phase shifters become rather lossy reducing advantages that MEMS-based phase shifters may offer.  This proposed project seeks to overcome these limitations by maximize phase shift per unit length, while increasing bandwidth, to arrive at a low-loss Ka-band phase shifter with significant performance and size improvements over currently available technologies.* [A Miniaturized Sensor for Microbial Monitoring of Spacecraft Water Environment, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uevq-vn76) - Accurate real-time microbial monitoring of water environment is of paramount importance to crew health as well as to ensure proper functioning and control of the life support system during space exploration. The existing methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the devices used are bulky, consumable-hungry, and ill-suited for spacecraft deployment. We propose to develop and demonstrate a novel, fully automated, microfluidics-based sensor for detection and identification of microbes in water. The final product will be compact, accurate, fully integrated and automated, power-effective, and fieldable in research and space environments. The program objectives will be accomplished via several innovations: (a) a milli-fluidic microbe preconcentrator to improve detection sensitivity; (b) CFDRC's proprietary dielectrophoresis technology will be adapted to develop a dielectrophoretic focuser for differentiation and separation of target microbes from complex sample matrices; and (c) microfluidic impedance spectroscopy-based cytometry to enable label-free detection and near reagent-free operation. In Phase I, we will demonstrate all critical components to establish proof-of-concept of the proposed technology. Phase II efforts will focus along two lines. First, component design optimization will be carried out with fabrication enhancements and extended testing and characterization for technology validation. Second, an integrated microfluidic cartridge and instrumentation capable of automated operation (sample processing and detection) will be developed. The prototype instrument will be demonstrated in both terrestrial and hypogravity environments (in collaboration with NASA researchers/facilities).* [In-Flight Imaging Systems for Hypervelocity and Re-Entry Vehicles, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k5ij-4xev) - It is proposed to create a rugged, reliable, compact, standardized imaging system for hypervelocity and re-entry vehicles using sapphire windows, small imagers, and independent telemetry.  Such a system is a novel creation that can tolerate the severe aerothermal environment associated with hypervelocity flight.  The proposed system answers a critical need for enhanced situation awareness, performance characterization, and rapid anomaly resolution.  Images of control surfaces, vehicle health, separation deployment, plume dynamics, combustion behavior, and many other vehicle properties provide a rapid, global assessment of the flows and control status of aerospace vehicles and propulsion systems using a standardized diagnostic package.  The system design includes a window, window mounting system, camera, and independent telemetry system.  Work in Phase 1 will include computational aerothermal modeling, window, mount, camera, and telemetry design, preliminary hazards analysis, and feasibility/ applications assessment.  A Phase 2 prototype will be designed and fabricated for testing at a NASA facility, and finally used on a variety of vehicles in Phase 3.  It is expected that the imaging system will have broad application for NASA, DOD, and commercial aerospace vehicles.* [LBA-ECO LC-03 Hypsography, Rivers, Roads, and DEM, Four Areas across Brazilian Amazon](https://data.nasa.gov/d/46ds-uh8p) - This data set provides four related spatial data products for four study areas across the Brazilian Amazon: Manaus, Amazonas; Tapajos National Forest, Para Western (Santarem); Rio Branco, Acre; and Rondonia, Rondonia. Products include vector data showing (1) roads, (2) rivers, and (3) hypsography and (4) digital elevation model (DEM) images that were encoded from the hypsography vectors. There are 15 data files with this data set which includes 12 compressed *.zip files containing ArcInfo shape files and 3 GeoTIFFS.This data set contains vector data showing roads, rivers, and hypsography for each study area in ESRI ArcGIS shapefile format. The vectors were hand-digitized by the Images Company in Brazil from paper maps produced by the Brazilian government. Depending on the scale of the original maps, the digitization errors vary. For some maps, some vectors are missing. Data were manually checked for duplicate or extra vectors. These data sets were derived from several map sheets produced from aerial coverages dating from 1974 to 1978.The DEM images were encoded from the hypsography vectors and are provided in GeoTIFF format. The attribute value associated with each line and point in the vector segment is encoded into the image channel; the image channel is then filled in by interpolating image data between encoded vector data.  For each DEM:  1 image channel with pixel resolution = 25m x 25m.  DEM images are provided for Manaus, Tapajos National Forest, and Rondonia.  The files for Rio Branco were unusable due to a documentation error.DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products. KNOWN PROBLEMS:The data providers note that due to limited resources, these data have been neither validated nor quality-assured for general use. For that reason, extreme caution is advised when considering the use of these data. - Any use of the derived data is not recommended because the results have not been validated.- However, the DEM, vectors, and orthorectified SAR data (related data set) can be used if the user understands how these were produced and accepts the limitations.* [Multi-Platform Sensor Surveillance Network for Range Control, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6g3v-9ygi) - Prioria (Gainesville, FL) and its partners Aerial Products (Deland, FL) and Meridian Systems LLC (Titusville, FL) propose to develop a revolutionary new type of system which is both modular and standardized, and which can effectively interface with existing sensors such as range radar and acoustic intrusion detectors.  The system for launch surveillance/intrusion detection is based on a network of uncooled long wavelength infrared (LWIR) imagers with associated Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors and magnetic compass heading indicators, integrated into a small  package which can be deployed on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), balloons or blimps, and fixed towers.  Infrared imagers are chosen for their day/night and all-weather capability and because recent advances in uncooled technology has allowed the price of these sensors to become low enough for fielding a relatively large number of imagers in a cost effective manner.
	These LWIR sensors and integrated instrumentation will provide for the remote detection, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded into areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations. In order to achieve accurate identification, the time and position of potential intrusions will be recorded in a "track file" for each detection incidence.  Data fusion techniques will fuse tracks from various sensors into a single track when possible, and objects will be tracked with multi-target tracking techniques as necessary. This will require the use of encrypted communication, so track data and associated intruder imagery from individual sensors can be combined at a centralized control station as a fused track file. In the cases where intrusions are deemed security risks, further action can be undertaken, such as deployment of a small UAV to the intrusion site for real time observation, while range control and security evaluate the situation.* [Enhancing the Capabilities of the Global Aerosol Monitoring Systems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4wi5-rkth) - <p>The Global Aerosol Measurement System (GAMS) project is developing a new, low cost satellite capability for measuring the properties and distributions of particles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (collectively, the UTLS).&nbsp; This altitude region is important because there have been observed increases in the amount of particles in the UTLS.&nbsp; These particles typically reflect sunlight back into space and cool the Earth.&nbsp; GAMS will measure the altitudes and amounts of these particles by looking to the side of the spacecraft, through the thickness of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, and provide detailed information about how particles are changing in the UTLS.</p><p>The goal of the Global Aerosol Measurement System (GAMS) project is to develop needed technologies and observation strategies to optimally measure the distributions and properties of particles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS).&nbsp; The GAMS concept is based on the limb-scattering measurement techniques used on past sensors, most directly from the heritage of the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) Limb Profiler (LP) currently flying on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) spacecraft.&nbsp; OMPS-LP was launched on Suomi NPP in 2011, with the next planned launch of this instrument in 2022 on the next generation Joint Polar Satellite System-2 (JPSS-2).&nbsp; Because of the length of time between the NPP and JPSS-2 launches there is the potential for a significant data gap for these important measurements.&nbsp; The GAMS concept is intended to be a simple and low cost measurement system that could be ready to fill such a gap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The current OMPS-LP system measures light reflected by particles in the UTLS by looking behind the Suomi NPP path, looking through the thickness of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere (i.e., the limb).&nbsp; Although OMPS-LP has proven capable of detecting the presence of background particles in the UTLS, as well as particles from volcanic eruptions and meteorites entering Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere from space, it has very limited spatial coverage and suffers from sensitivity issues since it preferentially sees particles in one direct with respect to the sun.&nbsp; GAMS seeks to overcome both limitations by making measurements of reflected light In two or more directions relative to the spacecraft flight.&nbsp; Because GAMS focuses only on the limb profiling capabilities (versus the more comprehensive but&nbsp;more complicated OMPS system) it can be contained in a relatively smaller spacecraft, which will reduce deployment costs.&nbsp; Additional increased spatial coverage can be realized by flying multiple copies of the GAMS instrument in different orbits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this stage of the GAMS project we are working to develop capabilities for adding additional spectral channels to our detector system.&nbsp; We initially targeting 350 nm for altitude registration and 675 nm for aerosol detection.&nbsp; We are now developing an extension to include an additional channel at 1020 nm for aerosol detection.&nbsp; This channel will provide additional sensitivity to aerosol in the lower stratosphere, provides heritage overlap with other sensors (e.g., SAGE), and paired with the 675 nm channel provides additional information to recover other aspects of the aerosol distribution (e.g., particle size).&nbsp; We are additionally developing an observation simulator based on model output from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) atmospheric model.&nbsp; This will allow us to prototype assimilation methodologies to ingest the eventual GAMS observations into aerosol prediction models.</p>* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c53g-is78) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios provide useful insight into the complex factors that drive ecosystem change, estimating the magnitude 

of regional pressures on ecosystems and critical uncertainties that could undermine sustainable development. They also provide an understanding of the importance of institutions and values 

as the long-range outlook for the world's ecosystems depends on the course taken by global and regional development in the coming decades. The integration of changing ecosystem conditions 

into the global scenarios was taken as both effects and causes. The MA scenarios include those for population, income, cereal production and consumption, meat production and consumption, 

land cover, waster stress, water availability, acidification and nitrogen deposition.* [CubeSat Autonomous Rendezvous & Docking Software (CARDS)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xg75-chj8) - This task creates spacecraft mission manager software to autonomously (i.e., without direct human operator intervention) maneuver a cubesat’s orientation and position relative to another vehicle in a proximity rendezvous and docking scenario from an initial distance of 1 km to a close in distance of 1 m. The algorithms are tailored for the unique resource and actuation limitations of a cubesat operating in low Earth orbit. The software will be demonstrated in real-time in the lab using an embedded microprocessor system that has cubesat flight heritage.* [Extreme Environment Hybrid Gearbox Technology, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pw4j-vc42) - Rocketstar Robotics proposes the development of a gearbox that uses all ball rolling contact for the highest loaded output gear reduction stage(s), is dry film lubricated and limits peak stresses to the well documented threshold limitation of dry film lubricants.  Extensive test data exists in the literature for the reliable application of dry film lubricants in ball bearing applications.  A gear reducer that utilizes ball bearing gear elements as the gear reducers highest loaded components will provide high specific torque and reliable, long life performance consistent with existing test data.* [Integrated Multi-Physics and Advanced Diagnostics for NTR Development, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9bz4-e3x2) - Historically, designing a nuclear thermal rocket engine and determining fuel performance has been a refractory and anfractuous process.  Typically, fuel forms would be developed and tested in separate tests of mechanical, radiation and thermal testing, and, in the NERVA program, the fuel elements were assembled in a rocket engine and tested.  The fuel did not perform to expectations, and the engine needed to be disassembled, the fuel examined and fixed needed to be determined; then the process would repeat itself.

In the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Program, individual fuel elements were tested, but they could not be tested to full power density due to test reactor limitations.  Nevertheless, this was a far less expensive approach that full engine testing to determine whether the fuel elements in particular would withstand the rigors of the NRE (Nuclear Rocket Engine) mission. 
This proposal outline how LPS and its team members plan to integrate the latest in multi-physics model to simulate a fuel element based on a particular NRE design built up from designer parameters.  The multi-physics modules can determine fuel integrity and fission product retention as a function of temperature and operating times, determine micro-structure evolution including cracking and grain growth.  The fuel element parameters are derived from high level NRE requirements via the integration of the IROC (Integrated Rocket Optimization Code), linked with PHOENIX, a program linking multi-physics modules through MOOSE (Multi-physics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment)  Ultimately, detailed safety related information including results of impact analyses through extensive hydro-codes such as PRONTO/SPH and radiation transport codes such as MACCS2.  This enables safety to be integrated in from the very beginning of the design process resulting in a much more optimized safety based nuclear rocket engine.* [High-Efficiency, Nanowire Based Thermoelectric Tapes for Waste Heat Recovery, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/acs8-8q9w) - Thermoelectric devices offer a simple and reliable means to convert radioisotope thermal energy into useable electrical power.
Present thermoelectric devices based on bulk materials are limited by low conversion efficiencies, due to fundamental limitation of identifying materials with both a high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. Nanowires provides a means to circumvent this limitation, and achieve combinations of properties not possible with bulk materials. To accomplish this task, SMI will demonstrate the formation of nanocomposite structures in a SiGe matrix by gas flow hollow cathode (GFHC) sputtering creating high ZT for the GFHC sputter deposited solid state nanocomposite thermoelectric materials. The potential for high deposition rate, and thick films for the solid state nanocomposite materials, on a range of substrates, by GFHC sputtering will be investigated and demonstated, along with a pathway forward to development of a high efficiency TE power conversion system prototype in Phase II.* [Cathode Coupling Physics in a Hall Thruster](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7eei-ngy6) - As humankind seeks to reach Mars and beyond, advancement of electric propulsion (EP) will be a key factor in the pursuit of deep-space exploration. EP uses acceleration methods (electrostatic and electromagnetic), which do not rely on the conversion of heat to kinetic energy. Thus, EP achieves higher specific impulses than chemical propulsion through the acceleration of ionized particles. Among EP devices, magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters can provide the high-specific impulse, high-power propulsion required to enable ambitious exploration missions to Mars and beyond. Despite their potential advantages, MPD thrusters have not demonstrated efficiencies near theoretical predictions, which may be due to the 'anode fall' and 'onset' phenomena.

The proposed work is to investigate an MPD thruster with a suitable magnetic nozzle that can overcome the limitations imposed by anode fall and onset by controlling the field properties of the plasma in appropriate region of the nozzle and discharge chamber. Computational modeling provides a detailed understanding of the complex physical mechanisms. Improved magnetohydrodynamics models compared to experimental data will provide in-depth understanding of the limiting factors in the MPD thruster and useful insights for an optimal nozzle design. Finally, the proposed nozzle design will be tested numerically and experimentally.

The proposed work will improve the overall efficiency of the thruster, critically aid in the development and characterization of next generation MPD thrusters, and contribute to advancing EP for more distant and critical space missions in the future.* [ORSC Methane Ascent/Descent Engine Technology Development, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5uwq-83if) - Special Aerospace Services (SAS) is proposing a new and innovative ascent/descent engine using methane as its propellant. This engine will utilize the concepts of the Oxidizer Rich Staged Combustion (ORSC) cycle of the RD-8 to improve on performance over existing hardware. This SBIR program will leverage existing work SAS has done in conjunction with DARPA to on the RD-8 preburner to design and analyze a new engine with the benefits of the RD-8, but being able to use methane as the propellant. Additive manufacturing will be used to build the components of the engine to reduce cost and limitations in design.* [Development and Flight Testing of an Automated Upset Recovery System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jsgi-nmrk) - Loss of control (LOC) due to upset is one of the main causes of accidents in manned aircraft and is already emerging as a significant causal factor in unmanned aircraft accidents. On manned aircraft, recovery from an upset condition relies on the skill and training of an expert pilot. Due to reduced situational awareness and delays introduced by the command and control link, it is unlikely that a remote UAS operator will be able to serve this function. An advanced system capable of perception, cognition, and decision making is necessary to replace the need for an operator with upset recovery expertise and to mitigate the LOC risk on UAS. Barron Associates has recently developed a two-stage architecture that generates safe and effective recovery maneuvers for a large set of upset conditions including full stall and fully-developed spin modes.  The proposed research will design an upset detection system and integrate the system with the existing two-stage recovery architecture to yield a comprehensive autonomous upset recovery system. The decision about when to activate each stage of a recovery is difficult to make at design-time due to insufficient aerodynamic data and the inability to model all of the off-nominal precipitating factors that cause upsets. The proposed upset detection system does not rely on design-time characterization; instead, a rigorous statistical testing framework combines numerous pieces of information including vehicle attitude, rotational rate, and controller performance to answer the question: Has an upset occurred? Key Phase I goals include: upset detection algorithm development, integration of upset detection with existing recovery architecture, evaluation of system performance in simulation, and real-time hardware-in-the-loop demonstration using a commercially available autopilot.* [A Real-Time Fault Management Software System for Distributed Environments, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3diw-nx3e) - Fault Management (FM) is critical to mission operations and particularly so for complex instruments &#150; such as those used for aircraft and spacecraft. FM software and methodologies, however, too often have nagging limitations that restrict utility, and research and development continues to grapple relative to advancements in the complex systems they monitor. Modern spacecraft, for example, may have thousands of sensors and hundreds of systems/subsystems (and extensive cabling) but relatively few FM co-solutions. Theoretically, the overall FM challenge is in monitoring, modeling, and managing the huge numbers of signals and then determining how to detect them and set appropriate handling actions.

For complex systems FM is not trivial, and automated FM is tasked with catching potential failure conditions within interconnected networks before consequences elevate. Ensuring fault coverage while maintaining system reliability under these circumstances is a daunting challenge for even the most capable team, and from anecdotal evidence, it is apparent that FM remains partly elusive.

Our SBIR project herein involves the research and development of an innovative FM software solution called "DyMA-FM" (Dynamic Multivariate Assessment for Fault Management). As software, it uses model-based reasoning in a distributed processing environment for real-time detection and response to fault conditions.

Building on the Phase I successes, in the course of this Phase II we will further develop the DyMA-FM concept as an innovative full prototype FM software application, having a tiered hierarchical architecture design leveraging advances in mathematical modeling. Thus, as per the intent of the Phase II, we believe we have a well-defined and innovative FM system capable of meeting the NASA requirements and representative thematic goals of: (1) verifiability, (2) transparency, and (3) fault coverage. Phase II, then, will allow us to advance the development further and fully.* [SAFARI 2000 Surface Irradiance Measurements, Mongu Tower Site, Zambia, 2000-2002](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fprh-8tw3) - This data set contains the top-of-canopy irradiance in the shortwave (0.3-2.8 micron) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 0.4-0.7 micron) wavebands collected with an Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometer (PSP) and a Skye SKE510 pyranometer, respectively. The instruments were deployed at the top of the 30-m tower in the Kataba Local Forest approximately 20 km south of Mongu in Western Province, Zambia. The data include the hourly mean and maximum values from 0500-1600 GMT (7 a.m. - 6 p.m. local time) and cover the period from September 4, 2000 to December 31, 2002. The data were obtained primarily for EOS validation and energy budget modeling.The Skye SKE510 uses a blue enhanced planar diffused silicon detector and has a fairly even response from 400 to 700 nm. The Eppley PSP is a World Meteorological Organization First Class Radiometer designed for the measurement of sun and sky radiation, totally or in defined broad wavelength bands. It comprises a circular multi-junction wire-wound thermopile. A data logger sampled the sensors at 60-second intervals and recorded the maximum and mean values every 60 minutes throughout the day.The data are contained within a single ASCII text file, in comma-separated-value format, with associated date, time, and QA information.* [High Temperature "Smart" P3 Sensors and Electronics for Distributed Engine Control, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/win6-unhe) - Current engine control architectures impose limitations on the insertion of new control capabilities due to weight penalties and reliability issues related to complex wiring harnesses. NASA in collaboration with Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) has been conducting research in developing technologies to enable Distributed Engine Control (DEC) architectures. Realization of such future intelligent engines depends on the development of both hardware and software, including high temperature electronics and sensors to make smart components. NASA is particularly interested in the design and development of these applications for assessing the benefit they bring to the engine system. Compressor discharge pressure measurement has long been a key aspect of turbine engine control to manage stall margin. Given that, there is a need for a high-temperature, smart P3 sensor as a key building block for distributed engine controls. Given the current limitations of high temperature electronics, the business case for smart control elements (sensors and actuators) can be made in the fan/compressor section of the engine. The long-term objective of the proposed effort is to advance high-temperature P3 sensor technology for DEC applications through working with OEM partners and industry working groups to: (1) to iterate the current technology toward DEC formats/functions, (2) advance the digital electronics design/firmware and high temperature electronics, and (3) (through demonstration and stakeholder collaboration) present the viability (technical and business case) of the proposed sensor.* [MeshSLAM: Robust Localization and Large-Scale Mapping in Barren Terrain, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j8nz-fsd9) - Robots need to know their location to map of their surroundings but without global positioning data they need a map to identify their surroundings and estimate their location. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solves these dual problems at once. SLAM does not depend on any kind of infrastructure and is thus a promising localization technology for NASA planetary missions and for many terrestrial applications as well.

However, state-of-the-art SLAM depends on easily-recognizable landmarks in the robot's environment, which are lacking in barren planetary surfaces. Our work will develop a technology we call MeshSLAM, which constructs robust landmarks from associations of weak features extracted from terrain. Our test results will also show that MeshSLAM applies to all environments in which NASA's rovers could someday operate: dunes, rocky plains, overhangs, cliff faces, and underground structures such as lava tubes.

Another limitation of SLAM for planetary missions is its significant data-association problems. As a robot travels it must infer its motion from the sensor data it collects, which invariably suffers from drift due to random error. To correct drift, SLAM recognize when the robot has returned to a previously-visited place, which requires searching over a great deal of previously-sensed data. Computation on such a large amount of memory may be infeasible on space-relevant hardware. MeshSLAM eases these requirements. It employs topology-based map segmentation, which limits the scope of a search. Furthermore, a faster, multi-resolution search is performed over the topological graph of observations.

Mesh Robotics LLC and Carnegie Mellon University have formed a partnership to commercially develop MeshSLAM. MeshSLAM technology will be available via open source, to ease its adoption by NASA. In Phase 1 of our project we will show the feasibility of MeshSLAM for NASA and commercial applications through a series of focused technical demonstrations.* [Multi-Agent Optical Sensor Chip for Cryogenic Fluids Leak Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8k9g-ra4n) - In space missions, launch vehicles (LV) are filled with cryogenic propellant fluids. It is important to protect these LVs from any leakage of liquid propellants through a reliable, accurate, leak detection system.  Currently used analytical methods do not meet space mission requirements of low power consumption, reliability, low weight, and cost effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to adapt, optimize, and integrate optical detection technologies into an accurate leak detection system for H2, O2, and CH4.
Due to their extreme low temperatures, these cryogenic fluids induce a contraction of the materials they contact, creating a potential cause of leakage. Hydrogen leakage in air creates an explosive atmosphere for hydrogen concentrations (between 4% (v/v) -- the lower explosive limit (LEL) and 74.5% (v/v) -- the upper explosive limit (UEL)) at room temperature and pressure. The early detection of cryogenic fluid leakage is extremely important for reasons of safety, reliability, and economy. IOS will provide its expertise in optical sensing to develop a miniaturized, reliable, highly sensitive, multi agent detection prototype, a Multi-Agent Optical Sensor Chip for Cryogenic Fluids Leak Detection (MOSCLD). The study will target detection limits of 1ppm or less and a response time in the millisecond range.* [Self-Powered Magnetothermal Fluid Pump, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9r2e-cp5e) - The ability to successfully manage thermal loads is increasingly a primary design constraint for many emerging engineered systems.  Systems ranging from military aircraft to computational platforms to photovoltaic (PV) power generation all generate unwanted heat and traditional methods for transporting and removing this heat are often heavy, cumbersome, power hungry, or lack adequate heat removal capacity.  Excess heat can result in reduced efficiency in PV systems, limit duty cycles for pulsed power applications, and ultimately cause failure of critical components if not managed properly.  Similar problematic scenarios exist for many power generation systems, high power radio frequency (RF) devices, portable electronics, and lasers, to name a few.
	A host of thermal management techniques are currently available including heat pipes, liquid immersion, jet impingement and sprays, thermoelectric coolers, and refrigeration.  While these techniques are adequate in some cases, none of these methods alone can meet the needs of future high power thermal management without incurring large penalties of weight, power, or volume.  The technology proposed here overcomes these limitations through autonomic, self-powered, and self-cooling functionality by directly converting the unwanted thermal energy into useable mechanical energy for use in coolant pumps or refrigeration compressors.* [MeshSLAM: Robust Localization and Large-Scale Mapping in Barren Terrain, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ee3w-9w8m) - Robots need to know their location to map of their surroundings but without global positioning data they need a map to identify their surroundings and estimate their location.

Ordinary gauges are designed to provide test article data but they lack the ability to supply information concerning the gauge itself. Changes to the gauge bond integrity are observable in the thermal dissipation rate. A gauge is considered to be a "smart gauge" when it provides supplementary data relating Instrument attributes for performing diagnostic function or producing enhanced data.  Accordingly, a gauge with the ability to temporarily self-heat and monitor the rate at which the thermal dissipation occurs can indicate a gauge debond. This project developed novel strain gauge designs that enabled the detection of gauge debonding, and provided for temperature compensation of strain measurements. The improvement to the gauge increased instrument functionality and data collection capability. Two types of fully functional smart strain gauges capable of performing reliable and sensitive debond detection were successfully produced.  <p/><p>To improve instruments functionality in a harsh rocket propulsion test environment, this project developed an intelligent strain gauge.  The initial design for this project was a novel foil strain gauge with the capability to measure strain and temperature (Type 1).  The novel foil strain gauge pattern features the integration of a silicon-diode temperature sensor and a self-heating element. The silicon-diode sensor provides the gauge temperature for performing real-time temperature compensation algorithms. The silicon-diode temperature sensor was used in the initial gauge pattern due to its enhanced abilities, but after refinement, resistive temperature element was then embedded into a second gauge pattern (Type 2). Then, the debond detection function was tested by monitoring the temperature of the gauge while the gauge was heated and cooled. The temperature signature (rate of heating/cooling) from the gauge was analyzed for both bonded and debonded gauges. Finally, a small control circuit was created with the capability to self-execute a bond integrity check, and perform real-time temperature compensation was also added. By combining the control circuit with the special gauge the smart gauge was converted into a fully functioning intelligent sensor system.</p>* [An On-Chip Nano-Plasmonics Based Urine Protein Assay Cartridge, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9vye-inyp) - Long-term exposure to microgravity and radiation during space exploration can pose a critical threat to the health of a flight crew. Real-time monitoring of urine protein levels is an effective way to follow the onset and progress of many diseases and guide the prompt selection of proper therapy. The success of such diagnostic tasks, which is strongly desired for flight missions, critically depends upon the degree of automation and reliability of such trace level detection. To meet this need, we propose to develop a novel on-chip, nano-plasmonic sensor cartridge to concurrently quantify the presence of different urine proteins. The envisioned device is compact, lightweight, fully integrated and automated, and highly cost- and power-effective. The program objectives will be accomplished via several innovations: (a) a new nano-plasmonics chip technology-based SPR sensor that is compatible with miniaturization, (b) tailored array modifications, allowing for concurrent screening of multiple proteins, (c) microfluidic platform for automated biochemical processes, and (d) simulation-based design for rapid prototype development. In Phase I, we will develop and demonstrate the critical microfluidic components (i.e., filter, mixer and network architecture) guided by physics-based simulations, and experimentally demonstrate the two-type-assay on a single nanoplasmonics chip for protein detection. The simulation-based design will conform to specifications that are amenable to mass-production-friendly lithographic techniques. In Phase II, the nano-plasmonic sensor will be optimized to increase sensitivity, stability, and the response to regular urine samples. Finally, the sensor will be integrated with microfluidic components and control/transmission electronics to form a portable protein assay cartridge.* [CER_BDS_NPP-FM5_Edition1-CV](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9c5v-f4zw) - CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data in HDF.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_rapid](https://data.nasa.gov/d/27yt-c29q) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites. These orbits are determined sub-daily (ultra-rapid generation), daily (rapid generation), and weekly (final IGS product). The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator retrieves these individual solutions and generates the official IGS combined orbit products. The orbits generated by the individual ACs and the combination products generated by the ACCs are available at the CDDIS. These orbits can be used to determine precise coordinates of the observing stations, gravity field parameters, and Earth orientation parameters.* [SEDIMENT ANALYSIS NETWORK FOR DECISION SUPPORT (SANDS) LANDSAT GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF AL (GSA) ANALYSIS V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gfit-u9au) - The Geological Survey of Alabama (GSA) analyzed changes in the coastal shoreline and sedimentation using Landsat geotiff images as part of the Sediment Analysis Network for Decision Support (SANDS) project.  The daytime geotiffs images from Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 were analyzed for sediment re-distribution after a hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Alabama and part of the Florida area having coordinates 31 to 27 North latitude and 90 to 84.25 West longitude.  These are seasonal data for storms from 2001-2008.  In addition to the analyzed files, the data files include the ESRI files for zipped bands and grids, metadata, and storm temporal information for the sediment analysis images.* [Low Cost, Low Profile Steerable SATCOM Antenna, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ks55-sckx) - The small size of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms along with the need to reduce drag to increase flight time creates a need for low-profile antennas.  The oldest solution, a mechanically steered parabolic reflector, does not provide a low profile.  The modern electronically steered phased array is an alternative that does provide a low-profile antenna solution, but the cost of these antennas has prevented wider use.  Hybrid antenna solutions that are partly mechanically steered and partly electronically steered are an approach to maintain the low profile of a phase array at much lower cost.  Although existing hybrid solutions offer potential, there have been limitations in scan speed and Field-of-View (FOV).
FIRST RF has demonstrated the initial proof-of-concept capability of an innovative low-profile hybrid scan phased array antenna that reduces cost by nearly an order of magnitude relative to a conventional phased array for low profile applications and removes the limitations of previous designs in scanning and FOV.  This approach uses small mechanical actuators to reduce the parts count of the active components in the electronic steering portion of the aperture.  Unlike other hybrid scan solutions, which have asymmetrical fast and slow steering, this approach provides symmetrical fast electronic steering at angles near boresite with slower mechanical steering for large off-boresite angles.  The scan loss of this approach is actually lower than for fully electronic scanned phased array antennas, and the FOV is greater.  This technology is applicable for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) applications.* [Carbon Nanotube-Based Adsorbents for Ultrafine Particulate and Volatile Air Contaminants, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w5r6-qzgc) - While the protective qualities of activated carbon have been enhanced by the addition of specific metal salts, activated carbon technology has changed little over the last 60 years.  In this Phase I, Agave BioSystems and the Universities Space Research Association, propose to develop next generation smart adsorbents using novel carbon nanotube (CNT)-based structures for the adsorption and destruction of potentially toxic air contaminants.  Since CNTs have extremely high surface area, can be readily modified with metals or functional groups, and can function without the mass transfer limitations of traditional activated carbon, they are an ideal material for integration into spacecraft air handling systems.  Our goal is to build upon the unique structural and chemical nature of carbon nanotubes to generate a new generation of smart adsorbents.  The exceptionally high mass transfer properties of these in situ grown carbon nanotubes should reduce problems of current filters such as pore clogging or limited accessible material.* [Fast Neutron Dosimeter for the Space Environment, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v6ve-38zn) - Secondary neutrons make a significant contribution to the total absorbed dose received by space crews during long duration space missions However, only a limited number of measurements of the dose contribution from secondary neutrons have been made. In part this is due to an inability to easily discriminate between the fraction of dose which results from secondary neutrons and that which results from exposure to energetic charged particles. The energy of the secondary neutrons range from 1 to >100 MeV. Scintillation materials provide the optimum volume to payload performance, but their use has been limited by the need for PMTs.  A compact, lightweight, low-voltage, sensitive photodetector, such as CMOS SSPMs are an ideal candidate for this application.
In this work, we propose to develop a compact, lightweight, energy-efficient dosimeter for secondary neutrons from space radiation using state-of-the-art scintillation materials with a charged particle shield coupled to a high-gain, solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM), which is a high-density array of Geiger photodiodes, fabricated with CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology.  Such a dosimeter would overcome many of the limitations in the current generation of neutron dosimeters and meet the dosimetry needs for future human-space-exploration missions to the moon and Mars.* [Advanced Cooled Shield - Integrated MLI: Passive or Active Cooled System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/h4wt-95nj) - Cryogenic propellants are important to NASA's missions. Improvements in cryogenic propellant storage and transfer are critical to future long duration NASA spacecraft and missions. Advanced Cooled Shield - IMLI (ACS-IMLI) is an innovative ultra high performance system in which an Advanced Cooled Shield is fully integrated into the IMLI layer structure, reducing mass, forming a single robust system, with integrated cooled gas distribution in a cooled shield layer, eliminating heat flux through thermal shield tank standoffs or supports, and operable in both passive (vapor cooled shield) and active (broad area cooled shield) modes.

NASA's TA-02 Roadmap calls "Zero Boil Off storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions" the #2 ranked technical challenge for NASA mission objectives and needs.  Quest Thermal Group has developed IMLI, an advanced thermal insulation that uses proprietary discrete spacer technology to reduce heat flux. IMLI's unique structure is able to self support various loads, including a thin, lightweight vacuum shell for in-air operation, high strength ballistic layers for MMOD shielding, an external Broad Area Cooling Shield with cooling tubing, or an integrated thermal shield within the layers. IMLI's layer structure gives it unique capabilities, such as an embedded conductive, sealed thermal barrier. 

In this Phase I program, an ACS-IMLI system would be modeled, analyzed, designed, fabricated, installed on a cryotank, and tested for structural strength and thermal performance.  Advanced Cooled Shield &#150; IMLI (ACS-IMLI) could provide a lower mass, single insulation system, operable in both passive (vapor cooled) and active (cryocooled) modes, with 3 &#150; 4X lower heat flux than IMLI alone. ACS-IMLI could help meet NASA's cryogenic fluid management requirements such as Zero Boil Off for cryogenic propellant storage and transfer.* [Fault Tree Generation and Augmentation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7rfg-crqn) - Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components of system autonomy.  In order to guarantee FM effectiveness and control the cost, tools are required to automate fault-tree generation and updates based on design models specified in standardized design languages such as AADL.  Accordingly, we propose a fault tree generation and augmentation environment (FTGA).  Equipped by a fault class model and an FM method catalog, FTGA evaluates not only failure behavior in the application under analysis but also FM's capability and adequacy for failure mitigation.  Moreover, when an inadequacy in FM is revealed during fault tree generation or analysis, the fault tree will be allowed for augmentation through FM method insertion and be followed by a quantitative evaluation for FM effectiveness validation.  Therefore, unlike traditional fault tree analysis which plays a passive role in FM, the automated FTGA environment actively and explicitly influence system design and updates, enabling "fault-tree-in-the-loop" for a system's life cycle.  Further, by separating its generic functions (which we collectively call "shared package") from design-language-specific functions (which we collectively call "interface package"), FTGA will be an extensible modeling environment.  The anticipated results from the Phase I project will be a preliminary prototype of FTGA and a demonstration for concept validation.* [Nanostructured Fiber Optic Cantilever Arrays and Hybrid MEMS Sensors for Chemical and Biological Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hnh5-8kyw) - Advancements in nano-/micro-scale sensor fabrication and molecular recognition surfaces offer promising opportunities to develop miniaturized hybrid fiber optic and MEMS-based sensors for in situ analysis of chemicals and microbial pathogens in spacecraft air and water.  Such sensors have extraordinary dual-use benefits in medical screening for early indication of certain cancers and rapid detection of weaponized chemical and biological agents for homeland defense.     

Returning humans to the moon and "worlds beyond" as directed in the 'Vision for Space Exploration' requires manned missions of increasing duration.  Increased mission duration invariably increases chemical and microbial contamination of spacecraft.  Ensuring crew health and optimal systems performance thus requires sensors to continuously monitor spacecraft advanced life support systems.  Presently, adequate sensors do not exist and crews must rely on labor-intensive techniques to ensure safety of drinking water and breathing air.  

In Phase I we demonstrated feasibility of miniaturized polymer-coated fiber-optic cantilever arrays for monitoring toxic vapors.  In Phase II we will develop next-generation hybrid cantilever and MEMS sensors for detection of various aerosolized chemical and biological contaminants at SMAC-relevant levels.  To facilitate implementation by NASA end-users, sensors will be integrated and demonstrated with existing NASA air sampling devices.  Phase III commercialization efforts are well underway.* [Enabling Technologies for Fabrication of Large Area Flexible Antennas, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ip3d-udpb) - MesoScribe Technologies, a high tech start-up from SUNY-Stony Brook, proposes to apply a breakthrough new direct writing technology to meet the objectives set-forth in the NASA SBIR topic S2.06 Advanced Flexible Electronics.  This technology is based on revolutionary advances to modern day thermal spray materials processing enables deposition of wide range of electronic materials onto large areas at low processing temperatures and, for most part, requires no post-processing.  MesoScribe will develop large area patterning capability to demonstrate electronically steerable L-band, phased array antennas to meet NASA's goals.  During phase I the maximum dimensions for considerations will be ? x ? m.  This is based on the capabilities of our current motion system and not a limitation of the process itself.  The antennas will be designed, modeled, fabricated and characterized for performance attributes.  The flexibility of the system will also be assessed through appropriate bending experiments.  In parallel, conceptual strategies for large area fabrication will also discussed for future consideration.  Finally, MesoScribe will also demonstrate our unique ability in terms of direct fabrication of antenna elements on large space based objects that would provide a robust means for multi-functional integration of electromagnetics with space structures.* [High-Efficiency, Nanowire Based Thermoelectric Devices for Radioisotope Power Conversion, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/key7-m3th) - This SBIR Phase I proposal responds to topic S3.03 of the 2010 NASA SBIR solicitation, for Power Generation and Conversion.  Thermoelectric devices offer a simple and reliable means to convert radioisotope thermal energy into useable electrical power.  Previously, thermoelectric devices based on bulk semiconductor materials have been limited by low conversion efficiencies, with Figure of Merit (ZT) values around 1.0 or less.  Increasing ZT above 1.0 has thus far proved difficult, due to the fundamental limitation of identifying semiconductor materials with both a high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity.

This SBIR project will develop high efficiency thermoelectric devices based on nanowires.  The use of nanotechnology provides a means to circumvent previous limitations, and achieve combinations of properties not possible with bulk materials.  Phase I will demonstrate technical feasibility by producing high efficiency thermoelectric devices based on nanowires.  In Phase II, we will build and demonstrate prototype high efficiency thermoelectric devices.  Phase II will also develop low cost manufacturing technology for the nanowire based thermoelectric devices, and demonstrate a technology readiness level of TRL 6.* [C-Band SATCOM Range Communications System for ELVs using ESAs and High Dynamics Modem, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vpnw-x8bj) - Improving safety while increasing the pace of space launches requires improved communications capability. An increasing volume of real-time data from numerous sensors and systems can be transmitted to the ground if connecting links can be improved. One way to accomplish this is to use existing commercial satellites to supplement overburdened NASA communications systems. Used as an adjunct service, additional commercial capacity would act to increase launch safety, allowing an increased amount of data to be transponded to ground systems without detracting from the reliability of existing communication systems. Existing NASA links could continue to be used for mission critical requirements.
Limitations of two technologies prevent the transponding large amounts of data via commercial satellites. The first is a conformal antenna technology that can provide high gain by steering its beam toward the GEO satellite. The second is high-speed modem technology that can track a remote modem despite the wide dynamics experienced during launch and maneuvers. 
Paratek proposes to design a dual-beam, passive, electronically steered phased array (utilizing our proprietary Parascan?, phase shifters) and a highly dynamic modem to provide the communications link for spaced-based range applications. The system will leverage commercial Intelsat C-Band transponder network (4 GHz & 6 GHz).* [Aircraft Sensor-Logger with Power Replenishment Capabilities, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5kkg-b8v7) - Traditional instrumentation of an aircraft is a complex and time-consuming chore.  Once the sensors are installed, long wires for power and data must be routed through to a central data collection location where several large off-the-shelf electronic components reside, adding weight, cost and increasing the probably of introducing noise or faults into the testing system.  All of this necessary infrastructure leads to prohibit the use of some types of sensors and limit the total number of sensors used so save on time, cost, complexity and resources.  During the course of this Phase II SBIR research, Metis Design Corporation (MDC) proposes to develop a standardized data acquisition hub for aircraft testing sensors dubbed a "sensor-logger".  The sensor-logger would essentially serve as a durable sensor infrastructure node capable of autonomously facilitating local testing for multiple sensors of various types.  Controlled wirelessly by PC or PDA, data could be displayed in real-time, or logged internally for up to 40 hours.  The second half of the proposed research would then tie together the sensor-logger with the Phase I research, developing a power-replenishment device to attached to the sensor-logger to extend its operating capabilities.  Finally both devices will be flight tested in true aircraft environments.* [LBA-ECO LC-18 Hyperion 30-m Surface Reflectance, Mato Grosso, Brazil: July 2004](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4nbv-hwer) - ABSTRACT: This image was collected by the Hyperion sensor on 10-July-2004 at 13:16:16 GMT.  It was calibrated to apparent surface reflectance using the ACORN atmospheric model.The Hyperion imager has a spectral range of 400-2500 nm, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, spatial resolution of 30 m, and a swath width of 7.8 km. Sampling is scene based (256 samples, 512 lines) (http://eo1.usgs.gov/sensors.php).  Through these large number of spectral bands, complex land ecosystems can be imaged and accurately classified.Data from the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer may greatly increase our ability to estimate the presence and structural attributes of selective logging in the Amazon Basin using four biogeophysical indicators not yet derived simultaneously from any satellite sensor: 1) green canopy leaf area index; 2) degree of shadowing; 3) presence of exposed soil and; 4) non-photosynthetic vegetation material. Airborne, field and modeling studies have shown that the optical reflectance continuum (400-2500 nm) contains sufficient information to derive estimates of each of these indicators. Our ongoing studies in the eastern Amazon basin also suggest that these four indicators are sensitive to logging intensity. Satellite-based estimates of these indicators should provide a means to quantify both the presence and degree of structural disturbance caused by various logging regimes.* [Avatar Robot for Crew Performance and Behavioral Health](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ed2q-c3rc) - <p>This project investigates the effectiveness of using an avatar robotic platform as a crew assistant and a family member substitute. This type of avatar robot is particularly useful for maintaining crew behavioral health during long-term crew isolation. An avatar robot is both a physical and graphical representation of a person at a remote location and acts as a surrogate for that person.  The teleoperated avatar robot can interact with its environment on behalf of the person not present, thus providing physical and psychological assistance to others. The robot offers real-time motion control as well as speech and video communication with the people and environment at the remote site.  It can be equipped with remotely controlled manipulator arms to carry out tasks. Such a platform can be deployed on the ISS and other future near-Earth habitats, enabling the ground crew to assist the onboard crew on tasks. For facilitating crew behavioral health, the robot can be controlled by, for example, a crew family member and thus can act as a surrogate for the family member.  Similiarly, the crew can also control the robot at his/her home to provide closer interactions with his/her family members. Currently, the impact of such a system to the crew's behavioral health is unknown.  The proposal avatar robot platform can also be used to develop an ideal human/robot control/command interface; effectively controlling/commanding such a robot with multi-modal parallel outputs still requires much research. We will develop an avatar robot platform and perform preliminary evaluations to assess its potential benefits as a remote human surrogate for space-related applications.</p>* [Development of a Radiation Hardened CZT Sensor Array and 1U CubeSat Flight Test (>TRL 6), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pe9u-qfsz) - Instruments employing X-ray, gamma ray and particle detection are utilized in different sectors from medicine to industry and from basic to applied science. The solid-state detector array with detection ASIC is the primary technology of space-based high-energy astronomy missions that are managed by NASA in partnership with the international community1,2. A readout integrated circuitry (ROIC) specifically designed for photon resolving X-ray detection has been developed by Black Forest Engineering on prior NASA SBIR funding3. The BFE322 ROIC, bump bonded to a CdZnTe (CZT) 16x32 detector array, demonstrated single photon sensitivity, accurate X-ray energy determination, X-ray event time stamping, and low power dissipation (< 10 &#956;W per pixel) at ambient temperature operation; this represents a significant advancement in detection capability. The proposed Phase I improves ROIC performance by using low 1/f noise 250 nm CMOS, in-pixel amplifier tuning to match detector capacitance and rad-hard-by-design (RHBD) to provide >500 kRad radiation tolerance. The Phase I design will be a 32x32 pixel format with 600 µm pixel pitch compatible with CZT and silicon detector arrays. The ROIC will be fabricated and hybridized to CZT on Phase II and demonstrated using a PocketQube or CubeSat mini-satellite test flight to establish a TRL> 6.* [LBA-ECO LC-03 SAR Images, Land Cover, and Biomass, Four Areas across Brazilian Amazon](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ij7g-d9p7) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides three related land cover products for four study areas across the Brazilian Amazon: Manaus, Amazonas; Tapajos National Forest, Para Western (Santarem); Rio Branco, Acre; and Rondonia, Rondonia.

Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (RMD) proposes an instrument to monitor astronauts' physiological responses to stress, microgravity, radiation, infection, and pharmaceutical agents through detection of multiple biological markers.  This will be accomplished under conditions of microgravity, within the weight, size and power requirements of space missions, and with minimal human intervention.  One representative biomarker of interest is 8-oxo-dG that serves as an indicator of oxidative DNA damage from radiation, chemicals, inflammation, and by-products of metabolism.  Upon repair of the damaged DNA, 8-oxo-dG is excreted into the urine where it may be conveniently monitored.  However, serious obstacles to detection and quantification arise due to the low amounts present and the complex chemical composition of urine.  Current techniques suffer from at least one of the following shortcomings: they are slow and labor-intensive, require complex instrumentation and a highly-trained operator, cannot be easily multiplexed to monitor many analytes, consume large amounts of reagents, and are not compatible for use under microgravity.  We will overcome these limitations by incorporating all analytical steps into a single microfluidic chip. Our system will utilize affinity purification and electrochemical detection.* [Scalable Architectures for Distributed Beam-Forming Synthetic Aperture Radar (DBSAR), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mqej-9rcw) - Conventional SAR operates in the Stripmap mode. Wide unambiguous swath coverage and high azimuth resolution pose contradictory requirements on the design of SAR systems. A promising technique to overcome this limitation is Digital Beam-Forming (DBF) on receive where the receiving antenna is split into multiple sub-apertures. This provides the capability of forming multiple beams via post-processing. DBF techniques applied to SAR systems can increase receiving antenna gain without a reduction of the imaged area and suppress interference signals. A highly capable DBSAR instrument design would consist of wideband Transmitter-Receiver Module (TRM), precise multi-channel timing and synchronization and reconfigurable processing engine that can host the SAR processing, calibration and control routines. IAI's proposed approach is modular, scalable and meets the NASA goals of developing an innovative analog/digital hardware design for the implementation of distributed DBSAR architectures.* [Compact, Lightweight, Non-Venting, Phase-Change Heat Exchanger, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ensm-hgzc) - Future exploration spacecraft will need to operate in extreme thermal environments, with highly variable conditions for heat rejection by thermal radiation.  Thermal storage is a critical technology for these missions, since it enables the spacecraft's thermal management system to be sized for average conditions instead of the least favorable.  We propose a new technology for thermal storage based on an innovative, non-venting phase-change heat exchanger.  Creare's technology overcomes some of the key limitations of phase-change heat exchanger technology.  Our design maximizes the amount of phase-change material, eliminates large thermal resistances due to the poor thermal conductivity of the phase-change material, and accommodates differences in solid vs. liquid volume without a heavy structure.  In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of this approach through thermal, fluid, and structural analysis; assessment of critical trade-offs; proof-of-concept demonstrations; and design of a prototype phase-change heat exchanger sized to meet requirements for future space exploration missions.   In Phase II we will design, build, and demonstrate operation of the prototype phase-change heat exchanger.* [High Frequency Reflective Mesh for Small Aperture Antennas, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bkn4-dkwq) - The proposed Phase I program would develop and prototype a high frequency, high performance reflective mesh that is well suited to the emerging small aperture antenna designs.  The program will review heritage mesh architectures and trade them against new designs.  New materials and manufacturing methods will be evaluated with the goal of making low-cost mesh for CubeSat missions.  The mesh samples will be tested to determine their mechanical stiffness properties.  RF test samples will be delivered to NASA JPL.* [Lightweight High Energy Density Capacitors for NASA AMPS and PPUs, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qcsg-hrxu) - This NASA Phase I SBIR proposal addresses the development of lightweight, high energy density DC-link capacitors that are a key component of inverters used power processing units (PPUs). DC-link capacitors used in IGBT and MOSFET switching circuits are one of the largest and least reliable components in DC-DC and DC-AC inverter circuits. Tantalum capacitors used currently by NASA in such circuits, have significant parametric limitations in the temperature range of -125oC to >200oC.   This development proposes the replacement of electrolytic capacitors with high temperature, solid state, Polymer Multilayer (PML) capacitors that have been recently developed for automotive inverter applications.  PML polymer dielectrics can be used to produce capacitors with voltages in the range of 25V to 1000V.  The high temperature PML polymers are amorphous with very high breakdown strength and can operate in a temperature range of -196oC to >200oC.  PML capacitors are smaller than tantalums, they have 10X lower weight, lower leakage current, lower dissipation factor, lower inductance and lower equivalent series resistance (ESR).  The Phase I development will focus in producing and evaluating PML capacitors designed for PPUs utilized in Hall thrusters and roll-out PV arrays for solar electric propulsion.* [Atomic Interferometer Gravity Gradiometer Simulation Environment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3p3b-ze6m) - <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"

Pathophysiological manifestations after low-dose radiation exposure are strongly influenced by non-cytocidal radiation effects including microbiome and cellular gene expression. Using a mouse model for exposure to high LET radiation we observed substantial changes in the composition and functional potential of the microbiome. These were paralleled by changes in the abundance of multiple metabolites which were related to the enzymatic activity of the altered metagenome by means of metabolic network modeling. There was a complex dynamic in microbial and metabolic composition at different radiation doses suggestive of transient dose-dependent interactions between microbial ecology and signals from the host  s cellular damage repair processes. Functional shifts included features associated with dysbiosis at the onset of chronic inflammatory responses which could prMouse fecal microbiome after exposure to high LET radiatione-dispose space travelers to systemic long-term health risks.* [SEDIMENT ANALYSIS NETWORK FOR DECISION SUPPORT (SANDS) LANDSAT GEOTIFF V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w4iv-cut5) - The Sediment Analysis Network for Decision Support (SANDS) analyzes Geotiff images for sediment redistribution after a hurricane on the Gulf coast and then creates a product based on the analysis.

Unfortunately, conventional technology developed over this time period has required a complex balance of plant that adds to the overall weight of the system package. Research in the past two decades resulted in the creation of systems that minimized balance of plant components, but had significant current density and efficiency limitations, limiting their use. This SBIR program builds upon recent success in the development of a high-pressure electrochemical cell architecture and inserts novel water management technology to generate a passive liquid feed electrolyzer capable of operating at 2,000 psi - and scalable to higher pressures. If successful, implementation of this new technology can save substantially on system weight with a high system operational efficiency and enhanced current density capability.* [Bystander response to 2.5 Gy of protons in a human 3-dimensional skin model in 16 h after exposure](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gxbj-kxyh) - Bystander mechanisms that originate in the areas surrounding a tissue damage presumably play an important role participating in wound healing and tissue remodeling. Thus identification and characterization of bystander mechanisms will help to development of new treatments of patients with a radiation exposure. In the present study we irradiated 3-dimensional tissue model of human epidermis Epi-200 (Mat-Tek Ashland MA) with 2.5 Gy protons. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells located at 0.125-0.375 0.375-0.625 0.625-875 mm from the irradiation line. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH) and further gene ontology analysis and network analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems) and IPA (Ingenuity) accordingly. Significantly responding genes were identified at all distances and included sets common to both direct and bystander responses. False discovery rate in bystander samples did not exceed 20% (p=0.001) and was sufficiently low in the samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure (0.06-1.16%). Analysis of the fragments cut at the same distance revealed 52 54 and 88 differentially expressed genes. These gene lists overlapped each other had from 3 to 12 genes in common including CLED2 S100A7A. Samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure discovered 949 differentially expressed genes. Moreover the performed gene ontology analysis showed there overrepresentation of TP53 pathway (pathways p=2.04E-02) a common marker of direct irradiation response and also overrepresentation of the following groups of genes: signal transduction (p=4.52E-04) cell communication (p=1.24E-04) and cell cycle in the category of biological processes; DNA helicase activity (p=2.54E-07) receptor binding (p=6.19E-04) calcium ion binding proteins (p=2.57E-03) as the molecular functions. Differentially expresses genes of bystander samples had few categories in common such as cell communication (p=2.36E-03) and signal transduction (p=2.42E-03) among the biological processes and receptor activity (p=4.54E-03) among the molecular functions. Categories specific for the bystander samples included G-protein coupled receptors (p=7.24E-03) and ligand-gated ion channels (p=4.16E-03) suggesting a role of external stimulation and ion trafficking in bystander mechanisms. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model Epi-200 was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 2.5 Gy of protons. Four independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-375 375-625 and 625-875 micrometers) using three tissue fragments per a data point. Moreover three sets of whole tissue irradited samples were also generated for 0 and 2.5 Gy (6 samples total) and used for comparison of bystander and direct responses.* [High Efficiency Three Phase Resonant Conversion for Standardized Architecture Power System Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tj24-fsjb) - A low-cost, standardized-architecture power system is proposed for NASA electric propulsion (EP) applications.  Three approaches are combined to develop a system that will meet current and future NASA needs and exceed currently available power processor unit (PPU) performance in terms of electrical efficiency, specific mass (kg/kW), and cost.   The approaches include the use of (a) high-efficiency, 3-phase, dc-dc converters to minimize cooling requirements, mass, and parts count and maximize reliability and efficiency, (b) modularized and standardized sub-system design and fabrication techniques to accommodate power output scaling and re-configuration for specific ion thruster designs without the need to re-qualify hardware, and (c) attention to cost and manufacturability issues that will allow the implementation of electric propulsion systems on future NASA missions without the hidden costs of "hard-to-build" and "hard-to-scale" designs that are currently available.* [Nanostructured InGaP Solar Cells, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9dpn-j77g) - The operating conditions of conventional multijunction solar cells are severely limited by the current matching requirements of serially connected devices.  The goal of this SBIR program is to enhance the operating tolerance of high efficiency III-V solar cells by employing nanostructured materials in an advanced device design.  By using quantum wells and quantum dots embedded in a higher band gap barrier material, solar cell devices that avoid the limitations of current matching can be constructed.  This Phase I effort will focus on quantifying the trade-offs between short circuit current and open circuit voltage in InGaP / InGaAs nanostructures.  Ultimately, the technical approach employed in this program has the potential of achieving conversion efficiencies exceeding 50% with a single p-n junction device, enabling improved overall performance and lower manufacturing costs than existing technologies.* [Active MMIC Modulators for High Data Rate Spacecraft Transponders, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/t4q8-9c3h) - Space vehicles for deep space exploration rely on microwave and millimeter wave links for communication with earth stations. As the mission of space probes expands, the data rate to be transmitted increases, and effective, compact, methods of modulating the RF carrier with high-speed data become a critical necessity. Passive MMIC modulation approaches introduce loss into the RF path and analog phase shifters in particular can exhibit significant shortcomings such as insertion loss variations and phase-shift range limitations. For more complex digital or hybrid modulation schemes, passive modulator components may also need elaborate calibration look-up tables to achieve desired phase and amplitude modulation accuracy with respect to process and temperature variations. Hittite has recently developed high-performance, active I/Q vector modulator MMICs for communication systems operating up to C-band, based on SiGe and GaAs HBT process technologies. Our Phase I study has shown the feasability of  implementing a high-performance X-band modulator on the same 40-50 GHz Ft process. We propose to fabricate and evaluate this modulator as part of this Phase II program. We also propose to use this modulator in conjunction with frequency multipliers recently developed by Hittite to implement a high-speed,linear phase modulator at Ka band.* [Advanced Passive Liquid Feed PEM Electrolyzer, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e98h-pjcu) - Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers have undergone continuous development for the generation of oxygen and hydrogen for commercial, military and space applications since the 1970's.

The daytime geotiffs images from Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 were analyzed for sediment re-distribution after a hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Alabama and part of the Florida area having coordinates 31 to 27 North latitude and 90 to 84.25 West longitude.  These are seasonal data for storms from 2001-2008.

The approach of this project is to explore the performance of capacitive MEMS switching technology at low temperatures. MEMS capacitive switches represent an alternative to ohmic contact switches, where the RF impedance of the device is not dependent on metal-metal contacts. These MEMS switches operate with much lower effective series resistance (generally ~ 0.25 ohms) and do not have the issues associated with dry contact switching. This technology also has the advantage of operating very well at millimeter-wave frequencies and higher, where many of the most demanding performance limitations exist. This technology has seen significant investment through DARPA and the DOD, and is directly applicable to high-performance microwave components needed in several of the upcoming NASA missions.* [Scaleable, High Efficiency Microchannel Sabatier Reactor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nskp-3yvq) - A Microchannel Sabatier Reactor System (MSRS) consisting of cross connected arrays of isothermal or graded temperature reactors is proposed. The reactor array enables nearly complete single pass carbon dioxide reduction using the Sabatier reaction, allowing efficient recovery of oxygen from in situ carbon dioxide resources on Mars or other Near Earth Objects.  Arrays of microchannel reactors with decreasing temperatures and increasing residence times can be optimized to maximize reaction kinetics and overcome thermodynamic limits (85% conversion at 400 C)of the Sabatier reaction resulting in 99% conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen to water and methane.  Alternatively, monolithic graded temperature reactors can be developed that will optimize reaction kinetics with respect to the thermodynamic limitations of the Sabatier reaction in a compact and efficient design.  The Phase I efforts will focus on design and construction of the microchannel reactors.  The Phase II effort will build upon the feasibility demonstration resulting in the development of a prototype MSRS consisting of a microchannel reactor array and a graded temperature microreactor capable of 99% single-pass, carbon dioxide conversion to methane and water capable of processing 1 kg hr-1.* [CER_BDS_Aqua-FM3_Edition3](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tb9a-rxm3) - CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data in HDF.* [Low-Stress Iridium Coatings for Thin-Shell X-Ray Telescopes, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gk82-bcbx) - We propose to develop and commercialize a new type of low-stress iridium (Ir) X-ray mirror coating technology that can be used for the construction of high-resolution X-ray telescopes comprising thin-shell mirror substrates, such as the Flight Mirror Array (FMA) currently being developed for the IXO mission.  The urgent need for low-stress Ir coating technology is driven by the current limitations on telescope angular resolution resulting from substrate distortions caused by conventional reflective Ir coatings that typically have very high stress.  In particular, we have measured film stresses in excess of 4 GPa in the case of Ir films deposited by conventional magnetron sputtering.  It is thought that the distortions in the thin glass mirror shells (such as those proposed for the IXO FMA) resulting from such extremely large coating stresses presently make the largest contribution to the telescope imaging error budget, of order 10 arcsec or more.  Consequently, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to meet the imaging requirements of IXO, or other high-resolution X-ray missions in the future that use thin-shell mirror technology, unless high-quality Ir coatings having significantly lower stresses can be developed.  The development of such coatings is precisely the aim of our proposal.  Specifically, building on our successful Phase I effort, we propose to complete the development of low-stress Ir/Cr bilayers, and also investigate the use of Ir/Ti bilayers. We also propose to investigate the properties single-layer Ir films, as well as Ir/Cr and Ir/Ti bilayers, prepared by reactive sputtering with nitrogen.  Finally, we plan to transfer the low-stress Ir coating technology to our large, production-class sputtering system so that we can coat GSFC-supplied thin-shell mirror substrates and conclusively demonstrate reduced stress-driven substrate distortions.* [LBA-ECO LC-09 Soil Composition and Structure in the Brazilian Amazon: 1992-1995](https://data.nasa.gov/d/red6-nqhp) - ABSTRACT: This data set reports basic soil structure and composition information for five Amazonian research sites: Altamira, Bragantina, Tome-Acu, and Ponta de Pedras, all four in the state of Para, Brazil; and one site in Yapu, Colombia. Soil characteristics reported for all five study sites include cation information (e.g., H, Al, Mg, K, Na, S), percent of soil C, N, and organic matter, soil texture/composition and color, pH, and land use history. Soil bulk density and tons of carbon/ha are reported for only three of the study sites: Altamira, Bragantina, and Tome-Acu. All of the data are provided in one comma-separated data file.The five study areas represent characteristic differences in soil fertility and a range of land uses typical of the Amazon region. One of these areas, Altamira, is characterized by above average pH, nutrients, and texture. The other four areas are more typical of the 75 percent of the Amazon that is characterized by Oxisols and Ultisols, with well-drained but low pH and low levels of nutrients. Ponta de Pedras in Marajo Island, located in the estuary, is composed of upland Oxisols and floodplain alluvial soils. Igarape-Acu in the Bragantina region is characterized by both nutrient-poor Spodosols and Oxisols. Tome-Acu, south of Igarape-Acu, represents a mosaic of Oxisols and Ultisols. Yapu, in the Colombian Vaupes, is composed of patches of Spodosols and Oxisols. Three of the areas are colonization regions at various degrees of development: Altamira is a colonization front that opened up in 1971, whereas Tome-Acu was settled by a Japanese population in the 1930s, and Bragantina was settled in the early part of the twentieth century. Marajo (Ponta de Pedras) is the home of caboclos, whereas Yapu is home to Tukanoan Native American populations. In these study areas  slash-and-burn cultivation as well as plantation agriculture and mechanized agriculture are employed. Length of fallows vary in these communities. The two indigenous areas leave their land in longer fallow than do the three colonization areas, and the proportion of land prepared from secondary forests increases with length of settlement as the stock of mature forest declines over time.* [Optical Obstacle Avoidance System for Lunar and Mars Landing, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a2sz-qdhh) - The systems developed at fibertek for Obstacle-Avoidance has so far all been operated at 1560nm.  Such an operation is required due to the required eye-safety constraint.    This wavelength range has so far shown reduced efficiency to a 30% optical-optical efficiency in the last stage of optical amplification in the fiber based transmitter we have developed.  For space applications, we believe a highly efficient transmitter will be required with associated optical receiver technology.  We propose here to develop a highly efficient, very versatile transmitter based on Ytterbium-doped fiber amplifiers.  Associated with this transmitter we will demonstrate a coherent detection system allowing for both range and velocity measurements during space vehicle landing. The technology required for the transmitter/receiver and scanning is at TRL 5.  A successful Phase II STTR should allow for field testing bringing this TRL to 6.* [Row Column Phased Array Architecture for Low Cost, Low Profile Millimeter Wave Phased Array Antennas, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xnfr-3but) - There is high demand for electronically steered antennas particularly at millimeter wavelengths. However, the cost to develop and procure this type of antenna prohibits this technology from widespread use. The proposed innovation substantially reduces the control complexity of phased arrays by reducing the control set from MxN phase controls to M+N phase controls where M and N represent the number of rows and columns in the phased array. By reducing the control complexity, not only are the phased array devices simplified, but the control distribution network is substantially reduced. This simplification ripples across the entire phased array to improve physical integration and thermal management which often cost as much as the phased array components. This is particularly important for high frequency antennas where unit cell sizes become a significant impediment to system implementation. Another limitation in state of the art phased arrays are the conventional planar radiators that are easily integrated. A three-dimensional radiator and manufacturing technology is baselined to enhance the bandwidth and performance of millimeter wave phased array antennas. This combination enables significant opportunities to support multifunction operation.* [Tunable Laser for High-Performance, Low-Cost Distributed Sensing Platform, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jzb7-tbyx) - The proposed effort will establish technical feasibility of an approach to optimizing a low-cost, fast-sweeping tunable laser for distributed sensing. Multiple approaches for performance optimization will be reviewed, modeled, and simulated. Subsystem prototypes will also be fabricated and analyzed to understand subsystem hardware manufacturing and performance limitations. This Phase I effort will result in selection of an appropriate laser performance optimization approach and will yield estimates of performance, size, weight, power, and cost improvements expected from a Phase II prototype.
The resultant optimized tunable laser module would enable a distributed fiber-optic sensing platform with dramatically-improved performance and significant simultaneous improvement in platform size, weight, power, and cost compared to current commercial offerings.
The technology will considerably improve NASA's flight test measurement and in-situ monitoring capability over the current state of the art, opening up new distributed sensing possibilities for real-time, in-situ airframe/spaceframe measurements. In addition to supporting distributed static strain and temperature measurements, the technology allows for distributed fiber-optic acoustic/vibration sensing allowing for distributed modal analysis, non-destructive evaluation, and identification/characterization of transient events.
With an improved understanding of distributed airframe/spaceframe structural dynamics, the technology will lead to improved airframe and component designs. With improved, integrated real-time feedback control signal generation and structural health monitoring, future aircraft and space-flight vehicles will operate more safely, predictably, and efficiently.* [Nimbus-7 SMMR Antenna Temperatures, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pbqb-kkh8) - The SMMR Antenna Temperatures (Nimbus-7) data set consists of antenna temperatures from passive microwave radiometers aboard NOAA's Nimbus-7 satellite.

swath format, i.e. the portion of the Earth's surface viewed by the
scanning radiometer. Antenna temperature data are available from NSIDC
from October 1978 to August 1987.
 SMMR was a ten channel passive microwave instrument using six
conventional Dicke-type radiometers. It delivered orthogonally
polarized antenna temperature data at five frequencies (6.6, 10.69,
18.0 21.0 and 37.0 GHz). The two 37.0 GHz radiometers operated
continuously for each polarization. The other radiometers alternated
polarizations on alternate scans. The size of each daily file is 35 MBytes. The data are distributed on FTP. Copies of the data
format description are available upon request from NSIDC.

The scanner operated only on alternate days, due to spacecraft power
limitations. There are typically at least 14 days of coverage per
month, although major data gaps occur in August: in August, 1982, the
4th, 8th, and 16th are missing for both polar regions; in August,
1984, the 13th through the 23rd are missing for both polar regions.* [Oxygen-Independent Pressure Sensitive Paint, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f856-7sg5) - Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) systems are excellent tools for performing global pressure measurements in aerodynamic testing, especially in wind tunnel studies. The major limitation of PSP for pressure mapping is its dependence on an oxygen-containing flow, since those paints are actually oxygen sensors. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) is developing a unique coating in which fluorescence quenching can form high resolution images of the true pressure distribution on surfaces in transonic flow in oxygen-free atmospheres. The fluorescence in these unique coatings depends directly on absolute pressure, and oxygen permeation into the coatings is not required. The new coating, however, is completely compatible with the "legacy" (oxygen sensing) visualization equipment used in current transonic test facilities. With this novel pressure sensing technology, coating materials can be used that are not useful for oxygen-based PSPs, and coatings that can meet requirements not achievable with classical paints, like operation at extremely low temperature or in highly contaminated environments. In Phase I, IOS has created the oxygen-insensitive pressure-sensitive coating materials, and applied them to glass and stainless steel test coupons. The fluorescence emission lifetime and intensity of these test samples were measured at varying static pressures under pure nitrogen, showing significant correlation with pressure in the range studied (from 0.05 to 14.7 psi), and excellent repeatability. This sets the stage for Phase II development and delivery of a complete temperature-compensated true ambient pressure sensitive paint system that can be used to characterize flow around structures in hypersonic wind tunnels. At the end of Phase II, the coatings will have been tested at relevant environments (TRL5), and will be available for NASA to begin testing in a high-fidelity laboratory environment (TRL6).* [Space Vehicle Inspection High Range Resolution & Raman Spectral LIDAR, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hpyd-q4ep) - Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes .65 U cubesat format LIDAR, with class 1 eye-safe lasers for space structure inspection applications.  The LIDAR provides both Raman Spectra for determination of the surface chemical content for leak detection and HD6D imaging consisting of ultra high range accuracy 3D LIDAR and RGB camera images fused to give an HD resolution image.  Range accuracy for the HD6D is 15 microns to a range of 3 meters with a maximum range of 300m.  This capability draws on SPEC part inspection LIDAR.  The chemical detection capability can detect one molecule thick layers adsorbed on surfaces determining chemical content, allowing detection of leaks in pressurized or vacuum conditions with a range of 30m.  The 3D imaging allows surface imperfections like micro meteor or debris holes to be highlighted, and the chemical content map to be draped on the 3D display.     The 3D imaging rate is from 3.2Mpps.  The laser transmits an FMCW modulated signal allowing the extreme range accuracy.  The 3D imaging uses a 1550nm 2 stage EDFA, while Raman Spectral uses a unit diode, wafer laminate laser at 532nm, induced to operate in a Q-switch mode by modulating the pump.* [Green Applications for Space Power](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a5cq-se2k) - <p>Spacecraft propulsion and power for many decades has relied on Hydrazine monopropellant technology for auxiliary power units (APU), orbital circularization, orbit raising/lowering and attitude control.&nbsp; However, Hydrazine is toxic and therefore requires special ground handling procedures to ensure launch crew safety.&nbsp; The Swedish Company ECAPS has developed a technology based upon the propellant Ammonium Dinitramide (ADN) that offers higher performance, higher density and reduced ground handling support than Hydrazine.&nbsp; This blended propellant is called LMP-103S. Currently, the United States Air Force (USAF) is pursuing a technology based on Hydroxyl Ammonium Nitrate (HAN, otherwise known as AF-M315E) with industry partners Aerojet and Moog.&nbsp; Based on the advantages offered by these propellants, MSFC should explore powering APU&rsquo;s with these propellants.</p><p>Due to the availability of space hardware, the principal investigator has found a collection of USAF hardware, that will act as a surrogate, which operates on a Hydrazine derivative.&nbsp; The F-16 fighter jet uses H-70 or 30% diluted Hydrazine for an Emergency Power Unit (EPU) which supplies power to the plane.&nbsp; The PI has acquired two EPU&rsquo;s from planes slated for destruction at the Davis Monthan AFB.</p><p>This CIF will include a partnership with 2 other NASA Centers who are individually seeking seed funds from their respective organizations: Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC).&nbsp; KSC is preparing for future flights from their launch pads that will utilize green propellants and desire a low-cost testbed in which to test and calibrate new leak detection sensors.&nbsp; DFRC has access to F-16&rsquo;s which can be used by MSFC &amp; KSC to perform a ground test that demonstrates emergency power supplied to the jet.</p><p>Neither of the green propellant alternatives have been considered nor evaluated for an APU application.&nbsp; Work has already been accomplished to characterize and obtain the properties of these 2 propellants.&nbsp; However, the spacecraft are using existing leak detection sensors that are typically used for Hydrazine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Using these green propellants for the APU application requires decrementing their TRL down to 3.&nbsp; This task would aim to establish a TRL of 4 at conclusion by showing a proof of concept with a KSC-instrumented EPU asset at the MSFC Component Development Area (CDA). &nbsp;&nbsp;The task to accomplish this is called Green Application for Space Power or GRASP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A key technical difference (aside from the differences in toxicity) between Hydrazine and the green propellant alternatives is the combustion temperature.&nbsp; Both types of propellants are dispensed from their feed tanks through a catalyst material.&nbsp; The catalyst decomposes (reacts) with each propellant and creates the high temperature exhaust gases that are used to either provide thrust (in the application of a rocket engine) or to spin the turbine which provides power to an APU or EPU.&nbsp; Hydrazine decomposes at 900 deg C while the green propellants decompose at 1600 deg C.&nbsp; However, the existing H-70 catalyst (Shell 405) works best with dual-bonded nitrogen mixtures.&nbsp; Both ADN and HAN offer this dual-bonded feature.&nbsp; Although the green propellants may burn hotter with their own proprietary catalyst material, they will burn cooler with the Shell 405 product.</p><p>Additionally, both propellants are mixed with water and the water content can be increased to further reduce combustion temperatures.&nbsp; For this proposal, KSC will ship their green sensors (either for ADN or HAN) to MSFC and we in turn would instrument the EPU dedicated to that propellant.&nbsp; Following completion of one month of testing the EPU instrumented with leak detection sensors, the hardware would be shipped to DFRC for a ground test inside an F-16 aircraft.&nbsp;* [Selecting Days for Concept and Technology Evaluation in SMART-NAS Test-Bed Scenario Generation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8uc5-ifpr) - Crown Consulting, Inc. will investigate and demonstrate methods to enable rapid selection of days for scenario generation in the development and evaluation of Air Traffic Management concepts and technologies (C&T) in the Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for the National Airspace System (SMART-NAS) Test-bed (SNTB). The proposed capability will enable the rapid generation of highly operationally relevant scenarios for use in the development and evaluation of technology demonstrators such as NASA Airspace Technology Demonstrator, ATD-2 and ATD-3, Unmanned Aerial System Traffic Management, as well as new operational concepts such as Integrated Demand Management and Trajectory Based Operations. 
A significant motivation for the development of the SNTB is enabling C&T benefit, impact, safety and cost assessments for speeding up deployment in the NAS. Today, C&T introduction into the NAS takes decades. The primary reason for this is an inability to assess the operational impact of the interaction between the proposed C&T and operationally deployed systems in terms of NAS-wide safety, traffic flow efficiency, roles and workload of controllers and traffic managers, and impact on airline operations. Human-In-The-Loop testing and shadow-mode evaluation driven by operational data. Slow and incremental steps are typically taken towards deployment because of limitations in the development of mathematical modeling and simulation.
The proposed innovation seeks to augment the scenario generation capability of NASA's SNTB with methods and tools for selecting traffic, winds and weather based on the needs of the experiment allowing for highly operationally relevant scenarios. These methods and tools would actively categorize incoming and historical data using advanced machine-learning algorithms, allowing fast access to NAS streaming and legacy data in a big-data warehouse through queries generated via a simple user interface for specifying desired characteristics.* [Instrumentation For Multiple Radiation Detection Based On Novel Mercurous Halides For Nuclear Planetology, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pvje-mmuf) - We propose a spectrometer that employs a single room temperature semiconductor detector that can perform both gamma and neutron spectroscopy. The proposed detector is based on the novel mercurous halide materials, Hg2X2 (X=I, Cl, Br).  The mercurous halides are new wide band-gap semiconductor detector materials that can provide radiation detection with low cost, high performance and long term stability.  Despite years of research, no explored room temperature semiconductor detection candidates can satisfy all three features simultaneously. At Brimrose, we have successfully developed the growth procedures for high quality Hg2X2 crystals for long wavelength infrared (LWIR) imaging systems. Recently, we have been able to engineer our growth process toward gamma radiation detection and have demonstrated initial encouraging detector response from Hg2I2 to both gamma and alpha particle incident radiations. The focus will be on the material engineering aspect of the detector material itself (i.e., crystal growth and post growth processing), as well as on the detector fabrication and system design.   The proposed mercurous halides-based nuclear instrument can be used onboard NASA's orbiters and landers for space planetology. Specifically, it can be used to determine surface and sub-surface composition of planetary bodies via both gamma spectroscopy and neutron spectroscopy.* [LBA-ECO CD-32 LBA Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-MIP) Forcing Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dm36-3vjc) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides gap-filled meteorological observations from nine Brazilian flux towers for periods between 1999 and 2006. The measurements include: air temperature, specific humidity, module of wind speed, downward long wave and shortwave radiation at the surface, surface pressure, precipitation, and carbon dioxide (CO2). These atmospheric data are provided at 1 hour time-steps. These data were used as the standardized forcing data input for the LBA Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-MIP).The LBA-MIP goal was to gain comparative understanding of ecosystem models that simulate energy, water, and CO2 fluxes over the LBA area. The task was to subject all the models to the same forcing and experimental protocol, and to compare the outputs. The protocol is provided as a companion file, lba_mip_protocol4.0_20100309.pdf.The source meteorological observations for the forcing data, from the nine Brazilian flux towers, were recently published as Saleska, et al. (2013). See related data sets. These source data were gap-filled according to the LBA-MIP standard protocol. Note that the CAX forest tower was not included in the MIP. See the companion file driver_data.pdf for additional gap-filling information.There are 34 data products with this data set and they are provided in both text (.txt) and ALMA-compliant NetCDF (.nc) formats. The files have been compressed into nine *.zip files according to site.* [Millimeter-wave Camera, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nhbq-uru8) - Traditional SAR imaging at millimeter wave frequencies can provide excellent, high SNR, 3D images of features inside dielectric solids.  However, imaging at these frequencies requires thousands of measurements; raster scanning for data collection is time consuming; and data analysis and image rendering requires additional time.  These limitations make millimeter wave SAR imaging for nondestructive evaluation prohibitive outside the lab.  

We propose to show feasibility of overcoming these restrictions by designing a real-time, high-resolution, portable and 3D imaging system for terrestrial and in-space inspection applications.  We will demonstrate ability to produce high-fidelity 3D images from substantially reduced data with minimal image quality degradation.  We will also investigate further enhancements via spectral estimation or compressive sensing techniques.
In Phase I we will design an adaptive, custom sampled, SAR-based millimeter wave imaging system for nondestructive inspection of complex composites and structures.  The design of this imaging system will be based on novel and substantial innovations to a well establish knowledge base.  The innovations involve overcoming hardware and software limitations that currently make 3D imaging at millimeter wave frequencies slow, cumbersome and impractical for widespread use.

Our goal is to design a system with:  center frequency in the millimeter wave range; significant bandwidth; high-spatial and range resolutions; rapid image data collection; real-time image rendering; ability to image multi-layer structures made of different materials; high system dynamic range (high detection sensitivity); electrical and mechanical  design allowing adaptation to use in-space; modular and frequency-scalablity to accommodate large structures; user friendly design to allow operation by people of various skill sets.  The Phase I effort will include simulations and small-scale testing.* [Next Generation UAV Based Spectral Systems for Environmental Monitoring](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ut9x-mpjg) - At present, UAVs used in environmental monitoring mostly collect low spectral resolution imagery, capable of retrieving canopy greenness or properties related water stress. We propose a UAV based capacity for accurate measurement of spectral reflectance at high temporal frequencies and stability to depict diurnal/seasonal cycles in vegetation function. We will test our approaches first using spatially-resolved discrete point measurements characterizing VNIR reflectance and solar-induced fluorescence Y1, followed in Y2 by imaging spectroscopy. The ultimate goal is to produce science-quality spectral data from UAVs suitable for scaling ground measurements and comparison against airborne or satellite sensors. Because of the potential for rapid deployment, spatially explicit data from UAVs can be acquired irrespective of many of the cost, scheduling and logistic limitations to satellite or piloted aircraft missions. Provided that the measurements are suitably calibrated and well characterized, this opens up opportunities for calibration/validation activities not currently available. There is considerable interest in UAVs from the agricultural and forestry industries but there is a need to identify a workflow that yields calibrated comparisons through space and time. This will increase the likelihood that UAVs are economically feasible for applied and basic science, as well as land management. We target the consistent retrieval of calibrated surface reflectance, as well as biological parameters including chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic capacity, nutrient and chlorophyll content, specific leaf area and leaf area index- all important to vegetation monitoring and yield. Scientifically, deployment of UAV sensors at sites such as flux towers will facilitate more frequent (e.g. within-day) and spatially comprehensive assessment of the vegetation physiology and function within tower footprints than is possible by foot, from sensors fixed to the tower, or irregular aircraft missions. We propose a rapid data assimilation and delivery system based on past SensorWeb efforts to move calibrated reflectance data and derived retrievals directly from the UAV to users. We will utilize SensorWeb functionalities to strategically run a data gathering campaign to optimize data yield. As well, we propose a mission deployment system to optimize flight paths based on real-time in-flight data processing to enable effective data collection strategies. All spectral data will also be uploaded to NASA's in-development EcoSIS online spectral library, and we will employ a cloud system to manage the intermediate products. Ultimately, we will demonstrate the acquisition of science-grade spectral measurements from UAVs to advance the use of UAVs in remote sensing beyond current state of application, providing measurements of a quality comparable to those from handheld instruments or well-calibrated air- and spaceborne systems. A key benefit is that UAV collections at 10-150m altitude bridge the gap between ground/proximal measurements and airborne measurements typically acquired at 500m and higher, allowing better linkage of comparable measurements across the full range of scales from the ground to satellites. This proposal is directly responsive to the AIST NRA in that it: bridges the gap in Earth observation between field and airborne measurements; and reduces risk to NASA through development of methods to make well-characterized measurements from UAVs for integration, calibration and validation of NASA satellite and airborne data, makes use of a data delivery system in which measurements and derived products are rapidly distributed to users, and provides spatially explicit data of calibrated reflectance and vegetation traits new temporal and spatial scales not currently available. We submit in the Core Topic area 'Operations Technologies' and are applicable to the 'Ecological Forecasting' subtopic. We will enter at TRL 3 and exit at TRL 5.* [Strain Sensors Based on Sandwich Structures of Crumpled Graphene for Structural Health Monitoring](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y3d7-ezgi) - Space based systems are subject to varied stresses which induce damage leading to failure, therefore it is necessary to develop an onboard system to monitor structural health. The primary components of these systems are compact flexible strain gauges that can be applied to arbitrary structures. Researches have depended on nanomaterials to develop these systems, the most promising of which is graphene, a single atom thick layer of carbon that exhibits excellent mechanical and electrical properties, which has been successfully used in strain sensors, but requires advancement in sensitivity and ease of integration to be useful. Herein is proposed a stacked biaxially textured graphene strain sensor (SBTGRP) for structural health monitoring which takes advantage of the interaction between two mating sheets of textured graphene when subject to strain to measure changes to a system. Crumpled graphene consists of graphene which has been deformed to adopt a crumpled surface; this unique topography offers several advantages in developing strain sensors, most obviously increased conformability. The most interesting possibility for strain sensing is based on the interaction of two layers of textured graphene. Two mating crumpled graphene sheets make contact at the tips of the corrugations on their surfaces, these points of contact serve as electrical connections and the prevalence of these contacts can be gauged by measuring the electrical resistance between the two layers. If this stacked system is stretched the crumpled graphene will begin to adopt a flatter configuration and the height of the corrugations will decrease, reducing the number of contact points, increasing the resistance, and allowing for determination of the strain on the system. We have already developed SBTGRPs for human body motion monitoring but they remain to be optimized for use in structural health monitoring. Development of these sensors will allow for the creation of an integrated health monitoring system which will improve the reliability of future missions by offering a method for life assessment.

The main goals in optimizing SBTGRPs are: perfecting their fabrication method, quantifying their response to various modes of forcing, increasing their sensitivity to the low amplitude strains of interest for structural health monitoring, and integrating multiple strain sensors into an array to achieve full multimodal deformation sensing. While current strain sensors are tested in response to normal strains, in real world applications the systems will be subject to multiple modes of forcing, therefore it is necessary to fully characterize sensor behavior, using tension and torsional testing stages, under these conditions. This series of tests will allow for determination of unique sensor behavior which may be used to differentiate between types of strain as well as gauge their reliability. More importantly, the quality of sensing is dictated by the conditions at the interface, therefore sensitivity could be increased via careful control of the interface characteristics between the two crumpled graphene layers. Of primary interest is determining how the initial degree of crumpling of the upper and lower graphene layers affects sensitivity. A high degree of initial crumpling leads to a large number of interlayer contacts and therefore will require significantly more stretching to generate a significant number of disconnections therefore reducing sensitivity to low strains. Therefore it may be possible to increase sensitivity by reducing the degree of initial crumpling. As a final goal the realized sensors will be integrated into a large scale array for detailed structural health monitoring. Access to NASA facilities, for instance the advanced mechanical testing labs available at the Goddard Spaceflight Center, and researchers would be invaluable in advancing this work to develop devices to improve the reliability of space based systems.* [HPC Benchmark Suite NMx, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mbjm-h7z7) - In the phase II effort, Intelligent Automation Inc., (IAI) and University of Central Florida (UCF) propose to develop a comprehensive numerical test suite for benchmarking current and future high performance computing activities that will include: (1) dense and unsymmetrical matrix problems faced in space aviation and problems in thermally driven structural response and radiation exchange, (2) implicit solution algorithms with production models and benchmarks for indefinite matrices and pathological cases, (3) configurations scaling for large systems in shared, distributed and mixed memory conditions, (4) documentation for strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the toolkits used together with recommendations and (5) precision and round-off studies on serial and parallel machines, comparison of solutions on serial and parallel hardware with study of wall clock performance with respect to the number of processors

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

The MERRA-Land product, MST1NXMLD or tavg1_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional time averaged single-level at the native resolution. All collections from this group are at reduced horizontal resolution.

The data are on the GEOS-5 native 540 x 361 grid with 0.667 degree longitude x 0.5 degree latitude resolution. Data are archived in the HDF-EOS2 (Grid) format, based on HDF4.

If successful, we will aim at building and flying a mirror prototype on a balloon and then proposing for an Explorer mission or MOO. The ultimate goal is a telescope with 1 m^2 effective area at E=30 keV.<br />&nbsp;</p>* [Low-Cost and High-Performance Propulsion for Small Satellite Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bveu-zaiw) - While small satellites continue to show immense promise for high-capability and low-cost missions, they remain limited by post-deployment propulsion for a variety of activities like precision maneuvering, orbit change and controlled re-entry / recovery. Furthermore, any on-board propulsion system capable of providing sufficiently high delta-V is likely to impose constraints on handling, storage, operations and safety that may limit consideration as a secondary payload. Ventions proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a compact, light-weight and low-cost 3U cubesat propulsion system that uses non-toxic propellants to provide approximately 125m/sec of delta-V within a 1kg and 100mm x 100mm x 100mm mass and size budget.* [A Compact In Situ Sensor for Measurement of Absorption and Backscattering in Natural Waters, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vkm5-5gjt) - We propose to develop an active sensor for in situ measurement of the inherent optical properties (IOPs) absorption and backscattering at multiple wavelengths. Multi- or hyper-spectral absorption of particles and dissolved materials is routinely measured in the laboratory and in situ in order to characterize, for example, the quantities and types of phytoplankton based on concentrations of specific absorbing pigments. Similarly, backscattering is employed to estimate the concentration of suspended material. Measurements of absorption and backscattering concurrently, and at multiple wavelengths, are useful as proxies for biogeochemical measurements such as particle composition, concentration of particulate organic carbon, and particle size distribution, as well as for remote sensing calibration and validation.
The current state of the art for phytoplankton observation using optical sensors on autonomous platforms relies on linking biomass with optical backscattering and chlorophyll. The ability to quantify phytoplankton using absorption not only overcomes limitations of backscattering and fluorescence-based approaches, but multi-spectral (visible wavelength) measurements of absorption also provide the means to discern the presence of accessory pigments and pigment packaging, ultimately leading to not only improvements in phytoplankton biomass estimates, but also the potential for resolving phytoplankton functional types.
Briefly, the proposed sensor emits a collimated beam of light into the water and measures the backscattered light as a radial function from the beam location. An inversion algorithm is then used to convert this backscattered intensity as a function of distance from the beam to the inherent optical properties absorption and backscattering. Multiple source wavelengths are used and the sensor is packaged in a compact, flat-faced geometry easing integration into autonomous platforms.* [Enabling closed-loop control of high degree-of-freedom soft robotic structures](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sbx8-cz6z) - To expand the nation’s capabilities for space exploration, a new approach to robotic manipulation is proposed. The approach utilizes soft materials to create an extremely dexterous manipulator which can accurately control its pose without use of an external sensor. This enables safe interaction between robotic systems, tools, and humans in cluttered spacecraft. Unlike more conventional robots made out of hard plastics and metals, the robot can be manufactured, expanded, and repaired onboard spacecraft. During launch, the majority of the robot’s materials can be stored as a liquid in jars. When the mission requires a robot, the standardized modules can simply be cast inside a standardized mold, combined with their circuitry, and assembled into the desired configuration. Training of the robot is done in a shape-agnostic fashion, allowing the approach to be applied to arbitrary manipulator configurations, in addition to broader classes of objects including robotic fabrics.* [IPA-IPY Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP) Snapshot Borehole Inventory, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ssrw-vqte) - During the planning and implementation of the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007 - 2009, the International Permafrost Association (IPA) coordinated the acquisition of permafrost temperature data under the Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP) Project #50. The TSP project goals included the acquisition of standardized temperature measurements (snapshots) from all permafrost regions on Earth, preparation of a global data set, and development of maps of contemporary permafrost temperatures. As a result of the project, networks of boreholes, equipped for long-term permafrost temperature observations, were established and consist of approximately 860 boreholes in both hemispheres with more than 25 participating countries. Approximately 350 of the boreholes were drilled and instrumented during the IPY period under various nationally funded projects. Comparison of the current Mean Annual Ground Temperature (MAGT) and historical data allows participating countries and other users to assess the thermal state of permafrost dynamics over the last several decades. The TSP project also included active layer measurements, many of which are observed annually under the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) project. Future plans are for these networks to become part of an international network of permafrost observatories with data available for monitoring and multidisciplinary research in both polar and non-polar permafrost regions.

This data set consists of an inventory of these boreholes in two Excel spreadsheets &mdash; one by country (TSP_Borehole_inventory_countries.xls) and one as a composite (TSP_borehole_inventory_composite.xls) for ease in searching. The spreadsheets include the geographic coordinates of the boreholes, elevation, depth of borehole (BH), year drilled, the MAGT, permafrost (PF) thickness, country, responsible person, affiliation, and sponsors. A summary of the number and type of boreholes by country is provided in a PDF document (N_and_S_hemisphere_borehole_summary.pdf), and a high-resolution JPEG image of the borehole locations (TSP_BoreHoles_location_map_highres.jpg) is also included. The inventory lists boreholes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres with 790 of the boreholes located in the Northern Hemisphere. The inventory primarily concentrates on measurements from new and existing boreholes from 2007 to 2009. For historical purposes, some boreholes active since the 1980s are included. Boreholes are classified as four different types: surface (SU) &lt;10 m, shallow (SH) 10-25 m, intermediate (IB) 25-125 m, and deep (DB) &gt;125 m according to the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) classification. For Antarctica, the surface boreholes are split into two subclasses: &lt;SU (&lt;2 m) and SU (2-10 m). The TSP is a field component of the <a href="http://www.gtnp.org">Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost</a> (www.gtnp.org).

Data from over 500 of these boreholes are presented and discussed in a series of papers in the special IPY - TSP issue of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.v21:2/issuetoc">Permafrost and Periglacial Processes</a> (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.v21:2/issuetoc) that include five regional papers and one synthesis paper.

The TSP Snapshot Inventory was compiled and edited from individual sources by Alexander Kholodov, Permafrost Laboratory, Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and Jerry Brown, President (2003-2008), International Permafrost Association.* [Lab on a Chip LCVR Polarimeter for Exploration of Life Signatures, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ypsr-v3h6) - Life on Earth is unique in many ways; one of its great mysteries is that the building blocks of life on Earth (amino acids, nucleotides, sugars) are all chiral. One optical isomer of each amino acid or nucleic acid was selected by evolution. In our pursuit of finding life on Mars and beyond (Triton, Europa, etc.), it is likely that one of the clues to extant or extinct life could be the detection of non-racemic chiral molecules. This proposal describes the development of a highly miniaturized and ultrasensitive lab-on-a-chip polarimeter that will meet the NASA need to measure chirality in very small volumes of samples at very high sensitivity. The proposal builds on a novel technology that is based on a proprietary design, in which a modulated liquid crystal variable retarder (LCVR) enhances sensitivity and reduces size without sacrificing performance. This detection principle with a long-path-length microfluidic flow cell allows for the measurement of chirality in microliter volumes of samples. The Phase I effort has conclusively demonstrated the technical feasibility of the detection principle.  A miniaturized polarimeter with microfluidic flow cell was designed and fabricated. The polarimeter was calibrated and tested with samples. In Phase II, we will build, fully characterize, and deliver a miniature polarimeter with optimized performance, enhanced mechanical stability, and integrated fluid handling capability. The primary goals are to further improve the polarimeter's sensitivity, accuracy, size, weight, reproducibility, measurement speed, and power needs, conduct extensive testing, and  deliver a robust prototype, engineering drawings, software, and test results to NASA.* [SMEX03 ENVISAT ASAR Data, Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fqx4-kyhe) - This data set is comprised of browse images acquired over the regional study areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma USA as part of the 2003 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX03). The experiment was conducted from March through July 2003 via the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument on board the European Space Agency's (ESA) Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT). Cross-polarized C-band ASAR images were acquired in order to obtain a backscatter coefficient measurement over a range of natural vegetation types. However, the images provided here are only browse images and therefore cannot be used to derive backscatter coefficient values. Researchers interested in backscatter coefficient values must obtain the ASAR data. The total volume for this combined data set is approximately 65 megabytes. Data are available via FTP and are provided as JPEG image files and JGW georeference files. Also included and available via FTP are the following types of header files: HAN files, ASCII text files, and INI files.

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

  The MERRA-Land product, MST1NXMLD or tavg1_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional time averaged single-level at the native resolution. All collections from this group are at reduced horizontal resolution.

The literature sites 83% of astronauts who return from long duration missions lasting longer than one month experience cardiovascular deconditioning while in microgravity conditions; therefore, cardiovascular health will become increasingly important to advance missions outside of low earth orbit (LEO) (e.g. The Journey to Mars). Pressure suits, specifically AGS, are critical to preventing orthostatic intolerance (OI) while performing takeoff, reentry, and landing tasks.  More broadly, pressure suits enable astronauts to maintain homeostasis in vacuum conditions and are required during all extravehicular activities (EVA). Mobility is a critical factor and current limitation to both AGS and Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) designs stemming predominantly from the fact that they are inflated and therefore stiff.  Efforts have been made to revise current gas pressurized pressure suits and replace them with mechanical knit pressure suits, which are garments designed using passive, elastic materials, such as knits (fabrics made of interlooping stretch yarns).  However, mechanical pressure suits are difficult to don/doff and are not able to exert dynamic or controllable pressure on the body.

Active textiles are an emerging area of research that could advance the capabilities of aerospace pressure suit design by contracting on command.  Shape Memory Alloys (SMA), for example, are active materials with pseudoelastic properties and can be engineered to "remember" prescribed forms through an annealing process. Traditional knit architectures can be engineered to produce contraction if individual yarns incorporate SMA wire. Consequently, if a knit garment is constructed using an SMA wire, the garment could dynamically generate large displacements and contractive forces across the fabric surface and could turn on/off or achieve various compression levels. 

Contracting SMA knit technology can be leveraged to compress the body like a braided finger trap, applying tension across a large surface area. An ideal SMA knit used for an active AGS would exhibit a contraction sufficient to generate the required counter-pressure output for AGS/OI applications with minimal elongation because the height of the wearer is a constant. The methods/techniques for designing active SMA knit materials for an AGS design will focus on the assessment of SMA knit samples based on their magnitude of shape change, force generation and pressure output. Voltage, wire gauge, wire diameter, and number of courses containing SMA wire will each be varied to assess their effect on these three variables.  

An SMA knit AGS could provide a controllable, mobile and untethered garment that can create (or relieve) compression on the user.  Leveraging SMA knit technology in compression garment design has a huge potential for improving aerospace pressure suits, which are critical for astronaut health and wellbeing as we transition to a new era in human space exploration.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/buwa-k2c3) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [Adaptive Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2799-aa4w) - The ADEPT project is a new, advanced heat shield design to protect payloads and landers delivered to planetary bodies with atmospheres.  ADEPT is a mechanically deployable heatshield, like an umbrella, that can open up at planet arrival to diameters 2-5 times greater than current rigid heatshields.  This large size overcomes the current limitations of NASA's heatshields to enable delivery of 10s of metric tons to Mars' surface - essential for human exploration.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_ultrarapid](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tuwp-ijme) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites. These orbits are determined sub-daily (ultra-rapid generation), daily (rapid generation), and weekly (final IGS product). The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator retrieves these individual solutions and generates the official IGS combined orbit products. The orbits generated by the individual ACs and the combination products generated by the ACCs are available at the CDDIS. These orbits can be used to determine precise coordinates of the observing stations, gravity field parameters, and Earth orientation parameters. The Ultra-rapid products are available for real time and near real time use and include predicted orbit information.* [Metrics for Offline Evaluation of Prognostic Performance](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5p2w-8pvp) - Prognostic performance evaluation has gained significant attention in the past few years.*Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part due to the varied end- user requirements for different applications, time scales, available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name a few. The research community has used a variety of metrics largely based on convenience and their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing a standardized approach to compare different efforts. This paper presents several new evaluation metrics tailored for prognostics that were recently introduced and were shown to effectively evaluate various algorithms as compared to other conventional metrics. Specifically, this paper presents a detailed discussion on how these metrics should be interpreted and used. These metrics have the capability of incorporating probabilistic uncertainty estimates from prognostic algorithms. In addition to quantitative assessment they also offer a comprehensive visual perspective that can be used in designing the prognostic system. Several methods are suggested to customize these metrics for different applications. Guidelines are provided to help choose one method over another based on distribution characteristics. Various issues faced by prognostics and its performance evaluation are discussed followed by a formal notational framework to help standardize subsequent developments.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Time Average 1-hourly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sh9r-winy) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present.

(Ir) X-ray mirror coating technology that can be used for the
construction of high-resolution X-ray telescopes comprising thin-shell
mirror substrates, such as the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) currently
being developed for the Constellation-X mission.  The urgent need for
low-stress Ir coating technology is driven by the current limitations on
telescope angular resolution resulting from substrate distortions caused
by conventional reflective Ir coatings that have high stress.  In
particular, we have measured film stresses in excess of 3 GPa in the
case of 30 nm Ir films deposited by conventional magnetron sputtering
techniques.  The distortions in thin glass mirror shells (such as those
suitable for the Constellation-X SXT) resulting from these extremely
large coating stresses presently make the largest contribution to the
SXT telescope imaging error budget, of order 10 arcsec or more.
Consequently, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to meet the
imaging requirements of Constellation-X, or other future high-resolution
X-ray missions, unless high-quality Ir coatings having significantly
lower stresses can be developed.  The development of such coatings is
precisely the aim of our proposal.* [Nimbus-7 SMMR Antenna Temperatures](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wrdp-sfnv) - The SMMR Antenna Temperatures (Nimbus-7) data set consists of antenna temperatures from passive microwave radiometers aboard NOAA's Nimbus-7 satellite. The instrument is the Scanning Multichannel Microwave
Radiometer (SMMR). Each file consists of one days worth of data in
swath format, i.e. the portion of the Earth's surface viewed by the
scanning radiometer. Antenna temperature data are available from NSIDC
from October 1978 to August 1987.
 SMMR was a ten channel passive microwave instrument using six
conventional Dicke-type radiometers. It delivered orthogonally
polarized antenna temperature data at five frequencies (6.6, 10.69,
18.0 21.0 and 37.0 GHz). The two 37.0 GHz radiometers operated
continuously for each polarization. The other radiometers alternated
polarizations on alternate scans. The size of each daily file is 35 MBytes. The data are distributed on FTP. Copies of the data
format description are available upon request from NSIDC.

The scanner operated only on alternate days, due to spacecraft power
limitations. There are typically at least 14 days of coverage per
month, although major data gaps occur in August: in August, 1982, the
4th, 8th, and 16th are missing for both polar regions; in August,
1984, the 13th through the 23rd are missing for both polar regions.* [Non Thermal Plasma Assisted Catalytic Reactor for CO2 Methanation, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q8n4-4jji) - In situ production of methane as propellant by methanation of CO2, also called Sabatier reaction, is a key enabling technology required for sustainable and affordable human exploration of Mars. The Sabatier reaction is conventionally carried out in a fixed bed catalyst at high temperatures of 350-400 ?C. For the long duration future Mars missions (~ 18 months expected stay on Mars), the fixed bed Sabatier reactor design however is inadequate due to performance and catalyst durability issues. In addition thermal management within the reactor is a major issue due to exothermicity of the reaction. Lynntech has demonstrated the feasibility of a novel low power, low temperature plasma assisted catalysis process for addressing these limitations with the methanation of CO2 at a scale of 14 g/h methane production rate. In the Phase II project, Lynntech proposes to build and demonstrate a full scale (0.55 kg/h methane production rate) Sabatier reactor for NASA application. The anticipated Technology Readiness Level at the beginning and ending of Phase II will be 3 and 4, respectively.* [MODIS/Terra Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 1km Subsetted V005](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ygwf-7rrp) - This data type (MOD02SSH) is a subsample from the MODIS Level 1B 1-km data.
                        Every fifth pixel is taken from the MOD021KM product and written out to
                        MOD02SSH. The subsampling starts at the third frame, and at the third line.
                        Here, "frame" and "line" are naming conventions for pixels along and across the
                        scan, respectively. Since MOD02SSH is a subsampled Level 1B , many things from
                        the Level 1B documentation apply as well. That is, the MOD02SSH data product
                        contains calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 36 bands generated
                        from MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance (MOD 01). The radiance units are in
                        W/(m ^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including quality flags, error
                        estimates and calibration data. Visible, shortwave infrared (SWIR), and Near
                        Infrared (NIR) measurements are made during daytime only, while radiances for
                        Thermal Infrared (TIR) are measured continuously.
                        
                        As it's parent, the MOD02SSH is in HDF-EOS format, and all metadata structures
                        and names are preserved for better convenience. However, some relevant changes
                        are made where appropriate. E.g. the dimension mappings are updated to reflect
                        the new one-to-one correspondance between the data and geolocations. The latter
                        is one of the most important differences: in the MOD02SSH, there is no offset

                        that from MOD021KM (nominally it is 2330 by 2030 km, cross-track by
                        along-track, respectively). The MOD02SSH is produced continuously, and thus the

                        The V004 Program Executable (PGE), for MODIS Level 1B products, has gone
                        through a series of revisions since the initial release of V4.0.0 in March of
                        2002. These include revisions to make it LINUX-compatible. The current version
                        is V4.0.9, which does not contain changes to the code that affect scientific
                        output.
                        
                        Below is a brief overview of changes that affect scientific output in previous
                        versions (V4.0.0 to V4.0.7) of PGE code. The MCST web site, listed in the URL
                        section of this DIF, has a more detailed version of this information, including
                        revisions that do not affect scientific output.
                        
                        Significant changes to Look Up Tables (LUT) used in Level 1B processing have
                        occurred. These include revising the Response-versus-Scan Angle (RVS) LUTs from
                        listing the RVS corrections to listing the quadratic coefficients used in
                        making the RVS correction. The coefficients are now calculated by interpolating
                        on the granule collection time and the RVS corrections are then generated using
                        the interpolated coefficients. Previously used Emissive and Reflective RVS LUT
                        tables were eliminated and new ones introduced.

The flow-angle and airspeed sensor system  (FASS) will provide airspeed with practically zero-lag and to less than one knot accuracy and flow angularity to a fraction of a degree, with natural immunity to EMI and RFI. Unlike Pitot-static and other conventional techniques, which experience serious limitations in accuracy, pneumatic lags, and frequency response in thin upper atmospheres, FASS will measure airspeed all the way to zero knots and perform equally well at sea level as well at high altitudes and even in the thin Martian atmosphere. The FASS addresses important flight-operation and flight research problems with crucial impact on vehicle performance, stability & control, structural loads, and pilot action. FASS will permit easy integration with aircraft avionics systems including conventional instruments used for pressure, temperature, and density measurements. Sensor elements will be coated to withstand harsh environment and waterproofed for underwater applications. FASS will be developed and marketed both as a stand-alone device and as an embedded, non-intrusive system. Commercial applications include aerospace vehicles, submarines, ships, boats, atmospheric wind sensing, oceanographic measurements, and tall structures.* [Use-Driven Testbed for Evaluating Systems and Technologies (U-TEST), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rsud-kchd) - The limitations of current airspace management have necessitated the
planning and development of the Next Generation Air Transportation
System (NextGen). NextGen seeks to change the fundamental structure of
airspace management to increase the safety and efficiency of flight
operations. This effort will require the introduction of advanced flight
deck technologies capable of meeting NextGen requirements, such as
assimilating weather information into navigation displays. To rigorously
evaluate the effectiveness of these new human-machine interface designs,
we propose the Use-driven Testbed for Evaluating Systems and
Technologies (U-TEST). This proposed innovation will provide a platform
for collecting and integrating human performance measures for evaluating
NextGen technologies in simulated environments. At the core of U-TEST
will be a data integration platform that combines multiple data streams
(i.e. observer-based, system-based, and self-report measures), producing
a comprehensive evaluation of pilot performance using novel systems and
technologies. The 3D Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) will
serve as a vehicle for U-TEST development during this SBIR effort.
System engineers can utilize the U-TEST environment to acquire rapid,
comprehensive, and cost-effective feedback to inform the modification of
emerging flight deck systems.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jheh-3e5e) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [Real-time Ethylene Sensor Based on Chemical Anisotropic Nanochannel Impedance Spectroscopy, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dx88-8rwt) - NASA has need of a real-time sensor capable of <25ppb detection of ethylene for off-world greenhouse monitoring. NanoLab proposes the use of a fundamentally new style of sensor based off of anisotropic impedance analysis of vertically aligned nanotube arrays (VANTA). Specifically, we propose the use of chemical anisotropic nanochannel impedance spectroscopy (CANIS). This style of sensor provides up to eight degrees of analytical freedom, resulting in extreme discrimination between chemical species without requiring modification of the sensor to provide selectivity. For the particular application of ethylene sensing, NanoLab proposes the use of a carbon nanotube based CANIS sensor, sensitized to improve the interaction of ethylene with the surface, using either a metal or metal organic coating, in order to lower the limit of detection. The sensor will be self-referencing to minimize drift, and will be capable of simultaneously monitoring other relevant species, such as water, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and ammonia without interference to the detection of ethylene. The sensor will be lightweight, and have a footprint of 1cm x 1cm.* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Aerosol Index Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ycny-j56d) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Aerosol Index Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format. 

The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Version 8 Monthly Gridded Data consist of monthly, global coverage of total column ozone, aerosol index, Lambertian effective reflectivity(Rayleigh corrected) and surface UV-B Erythemal irradiances. 

Four TOMS instruments have been successfully flown on the following satellites: Nimbus-7 (Nov. 1978 - May 1993), Meteor-3 (Aug. 1991 - Dec. 1994), Earth Probe (July 1996 - current), and ADEOS (Sep. 1996 - June 1997).

These are, so far, the highest spatial resolution thermal data ever obtained for Mars. Four slightly overlapping thermal panoramas (also called scans or swaths) cover a large portion of the equatorial region from 30 deg.S to 6 deg.N latitude. Simultaneous visible panoramas were taken during each of the four observing sessions; due to spacecraft memory limitations, visible channel processing was stopped early relative to the thermal channel for 2 of the sessions (2 and 4). Thus, the visible channel panoramas are shorter than the thermal panoramas for these sessions. These data are saved for historical reasons; they are not considered to be of archival quality.* [Distributed Leak Detection System Using Structure-Borne Noise, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jz98-3stw) - Manned spacecraft are vulnerable to air leaks caused by micrometeorite
and space debris impact.  The ability to detect and quickly locate and
mitigate a pressure vessel breach is critical to the safety of any long
duration spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or a
proposed lunar base or mission to Mars.  Current NASA protocol for
finding a spacecraft leak uses a handheld ultrasonic directional
microphone, similar to those widely deployed industrially, to detect the
40 kHz airborne ultrasonic hiss generated by the downstream leak
turbulence.  However, known limitations exist regarding the use of
airborne ultrasonic emissions for locating leaks in the spacecraft
environment because the downstream side of the leak occurs into the
vacuum of space, creating reduced leak noise inside the pressure vessel.
Blockages of the transmission of airborne ultrasonic energy by
structural components, avionics, and equipment racks also limit the
detection range of such systems.  An alternative approach that we
propose is to monitor the spacecraft structure itself---the pressure
vessel skin---for leak-generated surface-borne ultrasound by means of a
flexible and modular electronics package with fully integrated surface
sensor arrays, data acquisition electronics, and radio frequency
communication capabilities.* [Plug Load Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q9cy-stcj) - We provide MATLAB binary files (.mat) and comma separated values files of data collected from a pilot study of a plug load management system that allows for the metering and control of individual electrical plug loads. The study included 15 power strips, each containing 4 channels (receptacles), which wirelessly transmitted power consumption data approximately once per second to 3 bridges. The bridges were connected to a building local area network which relayed data to a cloud-based service. Data were archived once per minute with the minimum, mean, and maximum power draw over each one minute interval recorded. The uncontrolled portion of the testing spanned approximately five weeks and established a baseline energy consumption. The controlled portion of the testing employed schedule-based rules for turning off selected loads during non-business hours; it also modified the energy saver policies for certain devices.

Three folders are provided: “matFilesAllChOneDate” provides a MAT-file for each date, each file has all channels; “matFilesOneChAllDates” provides a MAT-file for each channel, each file has all dates; “csvFiles” provides comma separated values files for each date (note that because of data export size limitations, there are 10 csv files for each date). Each folder has the same data; there is no practical difference in content, only the way in which it is organized.* [Privacy Preservation through Random Nonlinear Distortion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ugj6-i2sw) - Consider a scenario in which the data owner has some private or sensitive data and wants a data miner to access them for studying important patterns without revealing the sensitive information. Privacy-preserving data mining aims to solve this problem by randomly transforming the data prior to their release to the data miners. Previous works only considered the case of linear data perturbations - additive, multiplicative, or a combination of both - for studying the usefulness of the perturbed output. In this paper, we discuss nonlinear data distortion using potentially nonlinear random data transformation and show how it can be useful for privacy-preserving anomaly detection from sensitive data sets. We develop bounds on the expected accuracy of the nonlinear distortion and also quantify privacy by using standard definitions. The highlight of this approach is to allow a user to control the amount of privacy by varying the degree of nonlinearity. We show how our general transformation can be used for anomaly detection in practice for two specific problem instances: a linear model and a popular nonlinear model using the sigmoid function. We also analyze the proposed nonlinear transformation in full generality and then show that, for specific cases, it is distance preserving. A main contribution of this paper is the discussion between the invertibility of a transformation and privacy preservation and the application of these techniques to outlier detection. The experiments conducted on real-life data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.* [LBA-ECO LC-39 MODIS Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gumw-g2hg) - This data set provides active fire locations and estimates of annual fire frequencies for South America from 2000-2007. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm. There are 14 data files with this data set: 7 GeoTIFF (.tif) files of fire frequency at MODIS 250 m resolution, where each grid cell value represents the number of days in that year on which active fires were detected, and 7 shape files of active fire locations for the years 2001-2007.* [IRAS MINOR PLANET SURVEY ASTEROIDS V5.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s5mh-xmjd) - Derived diameters and albedoes of asteroids, plus associated data on sighting and non-sightings, extracted from the IRAS archives.* [Using Real-Time Lexical Indicators to Detect Performance Decrements in Spaceflight Teams: A Methodology to Dynamically Monitor Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Mechanisms That Influence Performance](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5p2z-bpjx) - To date, we have collected data from HERA Campaign 1 (C1M1 – C1M4), HERA Campaign 2 (C2M1 – C2M4), and NEEMO18. The Year 1 effort was to conduct a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in the Year 1 HERA analogs. This was accomplished, demonstrating that (a) lexical measures can distinguish between high stress and nominal stress in HERA, (b) these measures are consistent with traditional pen and paper measures of stress, and (c) they show sensitivity to variations in stress levels. However, it is important to note that our goal in this project is to develop and test a lexical analysis tool that is tailored for, and optimized to, the LDSF (long duration space flight) environment, rather than simply apply an existing lexical analysis program. That is, we proposed to develop a lexical analysis tool, STRESSnet, that is specifically tailored to assess stress effects in the LDSF environment. This requires that we base this tool on a comprehensive model of the stress domain that draws on existing theory on stress, performance, and well-being, and that we incorporate terms drawn from the existing spaceflight corpus.     
In Year 1, at the direction of the project sponsors, we had to shift our focus immediately to testing a preliminary version of STRESSnet in HERA1 to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Thus, the methodological development of the STRESSnet tool was accelerated to meet this schedule, resulting in a quickly-composed scale that was suitable for testing.     
In Year 2, we are able to perform the more detailed, iterative tasks that are required for the development of the STRESSnet dictionaries. Therefore, there are two primary YR2 tasks that were performed: (1) Data collection and analysis of HERA C2M1 – C2M4 (analyses are still ongoing). (2) Tool revision and elaboration to derive the STRESSnet lexical dictionaries. This report focuses on the tool development task. The products of this task are the searchable dictionaries of lexical terms to assess stress and related states.     
To derive these dictionaries, we first developed a comprehensive model of stress, performance, and well-being. Guided by this model, we derived five major stress dimensions to be examined (attentional focus, cognitive load, anxiety, negative emotion, and social impairment), as well as a number of sub-facets within each core dimension. To develop lexical measures for each sub-facet (such as sadness), we first scavenged existing sources (available scales, questionnaires, existing lexical dictionaries, as well as reviewing Johnson Space Center (JSC) mission transcripts) to develop an initial inventory of terms reflecting that sub-facet or construct. We then initiated a series of iterative ratings of these word lists in order to include additional relevant terms and exclude irrelevant terms.* [Temperature-Modulated Radiative Coatings for Dynamic Thermal Management of Spacecraft](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y72a-666f) - During the course of its mission, a spacecraft is often exposed to significant thermal cycling. Hardware components, such as batteries, transmitters, etc. will only operate within a comparatively smaller range of temperatures. Therefore a thermal management system (TMS) must be developed to maintain the spacecraft's temperature at an operable level throughout the mission. One function of the TMS is to regulate the spacecraft's radiative heat transfer with the environment. Passive radiation coatings are a desirable way to achieve this since they require no electrical input and typically add a negligible amount of mass.

This proposal discusses wavelength-selective, temperature-modulated multilayer coatings which can be used to control the radiative heat transfer between the environment and the spacecraft. If the spacecraft's temperature is too high, the radiation coating can help to reduce the temperature through enhanced thermal emission by selectively emitting in the mid-infrared. Conversely, if the spacecraft temperature is too low, a highly reflective radiation coating can prevent further temperature decrease by minimizing thermal loss. The proposed coatings will combine both functionalities to provide temperature-modulated variable emissivity and improved thermal control. The temperature-modulated properties are achieved through the incorporation of a thermochromic transition material, vanadium dioxide. Currently a Fabry-Perot resonance cavity provides the wavelength-selectivity of the design, however other structures such as nanoparticle layers, gratings, and nanopillars, will be investigated. Alternative tunable materials, such as graphene or other transition materials, will also be explored.

This multifaceted proposal covers four areas: coating design, sample fabrication and characterization, metrology development, and device level testing. A general methodology to analyze and optimize multilayer radiation coatings that incorporate a thermochromic transition material has already been defined and used to model the radiative properties of several preliminary structures. Likewise, development of the metrology systems needed to characterize the samples' radiative properties, including an all-in-one cryogenic-to-high-temperature spectroscopic platform, is in progress. Variable emissivity coatings will be fabricated, characterized, tested at the systems level, and iteratively improved to deliver a dynamic radiative coating which has the potential to significantly advance NASA's exploratory mission capabilities. The findings of this research would address the TA14.2 space technology roadmap objective.* [Sensitive, selective nanoantenna-based biosensor platform for compact, in-situ exo-life detection and astronaut life support](https://data.nasa.gov/d/amf9-x5gb) - We aim to develop a new nanotechnology-enabled sensing platform exceeding the sensitivity and selectivity of the current state-of-art (SOA) in portable, low-mass, low-complexity biochemical sensors. This system is a new capability for space exploration/science applications, e.g. exo-life detection in challenging cryogenic environments, including multiplexed arrays in planetary probes, distributed sensor swarms for use with CubeSats, and other platforms, and builds upon our existing efforts at both NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and Dartmouth College.  

Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) – the collective electron oscillations excited in nano-sized metallic particles (‘nanoantennas’) by incident optical light – have been utilized extensively as sensitive, label-free optical probes for the study of biochemical interactions in both gas and liquid phase, due to their highly confined electric fields and extreme sensitivity to changes in their local environment (e.g. the presence of a target biomolecule.)  The ultimate limit of detection – single molecule detection – has been demonstrated with such sensing platforms, and will form the basis of our sensing approach. Yet, the selective capture of rare targets from a complex background near these transducers remains both a challenging problem and necessary step to advance this technology out of the lab and into the field. Therefore, we aim to close this critical knowledge gap in the current proposal, through the development of the tailored nano-recognition elements coupled to sensitive plasmonic nanoantennas. We will primarily focus on exo-life applications – as these are currently the most challenging and least understood – but with further application to astronaut life support, pathogen detection, and water quality monitoring.  

Field-deployable LSPR-based sensors are currently being explored for terrestrial point-of-care (POC) medical applications by other groups, including our external collaborator for this award at Dartmouth College. These devices are also conducive to the demanding requirements of space exploration, owing to their low-mass, volume, and power consumption, and ruggedization/simplicity in operation. Further, their small size, and relatively low cost with high sensitivity provide capabilities not possible with larger, more complex, centralized instruments (e.g. mass spectrometer). However, LSPR-based sensors (and mass spectrometers) are limited in their demonstrated ability to selectively capture and uniquely identify the target analytes in-situ (in possibly challenging environments), with minimal processing/contamination. This proposal is aimed at enabling this critical step towards a new class of chemical/biochemical measurements for space exploration applications.  

The goal is to advance the SOA in selective capture and sensitive detection of rare biomarkers in-situ, using small, portable, deployable biosensor platforms, with a particular focus on exo-life detection, and possible extension/application to in-flight astronaut life support (including water quality monitoring, health diagnostics, and pathogen detection).* [In-Situ / In-Flight Detection of Fluorescent Proteins Using Imaging Spectroscopy Sensors, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3nc7-ixfn) - The proposal addresses technologies relevant to NASA's new Vision for Space Explorations in the areas of robotics, teleoperations, and macro and micro imaging systems, while developing a generic biology research facility.

In order to carry out NASA's new vision of exploration and prepare for eventual human presence beyond Low Earth Orbit and on the surface of the Moon, Mars, and beyond, we must collec-tively understand how life and specific biological systems adapt, respond, and thrive in these unique environments.  Planning for extended human presence in the reduced gravity environ-ments of the Moon and Mars will require a solid biological understanding from the sub-cellular to the whole organism level.

The proposed facility supports space-based technologies that enable cross-species comparative biological research and will include in-situ autonomous capability to extract genetic, genomic, proteomic, and metabolic information while providing tools to utilize and interpret such data.  Of critical importance is the incorporation and utilization of these monitoring and control systems that will successfully accommodate and adapt to the changing needs of biological systems or specimens over long periods of time.

The facility will be the first scientific payload equipped with automated in-situ technology that allows detection and analysis of fluorescence, which is crucial to the fundamental understanding of biological properties of cellular, sub-cellular, and whole organisms during exploration of space and planets.* [Advanced Long-Range Video Capabilities Using Speckle Imaging Techniques, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u93d-scvb) - Flight-testing is a crucial component in NASA's mission to research and develop new aeronautical concepts because it allows for verification of simulated and wind-tunnel experiments and exposes previously unforeseen design problems. Video is an invaluable tool for flight-testing, allowing the collection of a wealth of information such as craft position, speed, health, as well as tracking different phases of flight, capturing events, extracting performance figures, and documenting historical flights.  For several cases of interest (high-speed/high-altitude aircraft, lakebed remote landings, vehicle re-entry, smoke airflow traces, etc.) it is not feasible or physically possible to install external cameras close to the aircraft whose behavior is being filmed.  Long-range imaging equipment is typically used in these cases, but the captured footage is severely limited in quality by atmospheric effects, which are often the dominating source of image degradation, long before diffraction-related limitations occur.  In consequence, long-range imagery typically suffers from scintillation, blurring, poor spatial resolution, and low contrast.  Since these problems result from atmospheric conditions, they cannot be overcome by simply improving imaging hardware.  What is needed is a solution to combat atmospheric distortion.  In Phase I, EM Photonics demonstrated a signal processing technique based on initial research from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  We modified and implemented this core algorithm and showed its ability to enhance imagery collected from the long-range imaging systems at NASA DFRC.  In Phase II, we will evolve and integrate the prototype components developed in Phase I and deliver an image enhancement device capable of running in real time to mitigate the image distortion present in data collected from NASA DFRC's long-range cameras.* [An Electrochemical, Point-of-Care Detector for Reagent-free, In-situ Diagnostics of Pathogens, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6jdu-dp48) - For long-term exploratory space travel, there will be a critical need for in-situ diagnosis and assessment of biological specimens from symptomatic astronauts, especially, disease pathogens (virus, bacterium, or fungus) and microbial contaminants. Hence, a real-time, non-culture-based microbial detection, identification and quantification system for on-flight monitoring and evaluation of pathogens from astronauts, or the space environment, is strongly desired. The success of such diagnostic tasks critically depends upon the degree of automation and reliability of such trace level detection. To meet this need, we propose to develop a novel miniaturized, point-of-care (POC) detector for reagent-free, no-culturing, in-situ diagnostics of disease pathogens. The envisioned device will be compact, lightweight, fully integrated and automated (requiring minimum human intervention), and highly cost-effective and power-efficient. In Phase I, we will develop a new type of electrochemical molecules and fabricate solid electrode-based probe for in-vitro demonstration of accurate and effective signal transduction of selective binding of pathogenic cells to the electrode as proof-of-principle. In Phase II, the electrode probe will be optimized to increase specificity, sensitivity, stability, and the response to regular biological samples. Finally, the sensor will be integrated with a compact handheld instrument for data collection, analysis and processing and interfacing with existing NASA space instrumentation for both terrestrial and microgravity environments evaluation.* [NACP Site: Terrestrial Biosphere Model and Aggregated Flux Data in Standard Format](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y2cs-jku8) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides standardized output variables for gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), leaf area index (LAI), ecosystem respiration (Re), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H) from 24 terrestrial biosphere models for 47 eddy covariance flux tower sites in North America. Each model used standardized input data for each flux tower site (i.e., gap-filled, locally observed weather; land use history; and other site specific data) and followed standard model setup and spinup procedures. The files also contain gap-filled observations and total uncertainty estimates. The data set was compiled for the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Synthesis for use in model inter-comparison and assessment of how well the models simulate carbon processes across vegetation types and environmental conditions in North America. There is one compressed (.zip) file with this data set. When expanded, the .zip file contains model output data for one variable at one site. The model output and observations are available at the native half-hourly time step, or in daily, monthly, and annual aggregations, in comma-separated text (.csv) format.* [DIHeDRAL: Downhole Regolith Interrogation with Helium-Assisted Drill and LIBS, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ixa8-x4uc) - Future landed robotic missions to the lunar poles will seek to characterize the properties of subsurface regolith. Current instruments for such in-situ analysis, however, require that geological samples be brought to the surface by a sample acquisition tool and subsequently processed and presented to the analyzer. This model has significant limitations with regard to science yield: evaporation of volatile molecules before reaching the instrument, loss of stratigraphic information, sample bias, and cross-contamination. Furthermore, sophisticated sample acquisition, processing and handling mechanisms required to operate in uncontrolled, dusty environments are expensive and failure-prone.

We therefore propose an alternative: bring the instrument to the sample. Specifically, we propose development of a fiber-coupled laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) system, integrated into a 3m-class drill. LIBS uses a high-energy laser pulse to create a plasma on the surface of the material under test; the atomic emissions are collected by a spectrometer and yield elemental composition and basic molecular information. DIHeDRAL will allow profiling of an entire borehole wall, centimeter by centimeter, 360 degrees, from the top to the bottom. 

The proposed Phase II work will include development of a functional prototype and its integration in a drill string and test to a depth of 1m. The performance of the sensor will be tested in a chamber capable of closely reproducing the conditions of the Lunar surface.* [Dropsonde System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/d4vm-b4vi) - A small, modular dropsonde launcher is being developed for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  Some critical measurement needs can only be satisfied by in-situ measurements.  Key examples of such measurements include detailed atmospheric profiles, point meteorological conditions on the surface, and in-situ measurements for calibration and validation of remote sensing systems.  
	Phase I work saw the design and fabrication of a new type of dropsonde with a novel form factor and the associated launcher.  The system was installed in a representative UAV nose.  System components were successfully tested.
	Phase II will involve finalizing the launcher and dropsonde designs, developing the associated control and data handling system, building and testing the integrated system, and finally conducting test flights on a UAV.  
	The ultimate result of the project will be a dropsonde system that can be fitted to many NASA UAVs, including small UAVs, and enable them to gather in-situ atmospheric profiles and surface measurements using dropsondes.

We believe the central problem in obtaining this understanding is that the most commonly proposed models for amyloid aggregation may be incorrect, and that the process is not fundamentally biological. We plan to investigate the pathways and kinetics of protein aggregation to allow accurate predictive modeling of the process and evaluation of potential inhibitors to prevalent diseases including cataract formation, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and others.<p/><p>The goal of the Protein Colloidal Aggregation project is to understand the underlying cause of several major diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. These diseases all occur when protein molecules undergo a peculiar and irreversible process in which they aggregate to form tiny fibers of a unique material called amyloid, which the body cannot remove. Despite enormous investment in research, the fundamental physiochemical mechanism of these diseases remains poorly understood.  Based on initial studies using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we theorized that the aggregation of proteins in these diseases is driven instead by colloidal interactions, the same forces that govern the behavior of nanoscale particles in the colloidal suspensions we encounter every day, such as paint, milk, and clouds. Our theory is being validated by the evidence. For many years, NASA has been heavily involved in research into the structure of proteins and their assembly into crystals, and in studying the colloidal interactions and aggregation of nanoscale particles. To date, however, NASA's colloid research has involved only nonbiological materials. But now we are bridging these two fields by studying the colloidal aggregation of proteins.</p>* [Modular, Plug and Play, Distributed Avionics, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g7bv-t7h6) - The objective of this SBIR effort  was to prove the viability of an Ethernet version of the  MicroSat Systems, Inc. (MSI) modular, plug and play (PnP) spacecraft avionics architecture. This revolutionary architecture provides a near-term solution to modular, plug and play avionics while distributing power and data management functions on a single circuit allowing rapid interfacing to other satellite avionics such as the GSFC Space Cube.  By integrating the MSI protocol converter technology with the ABET Technologies Digital Current System, MSI can provide a network with standardized attachment nodes that carries data and power on an Intelligent Power/Data Ring (IPDR).The IPDR network, which can host a variety of data protocols, currently implements a high speed SPA-S (SpaceWire) core to support the AFRL PnP efforts. It enables full PnP modularity reducing spacecraft integration and test to a few days.  Since the system is implemented with a common set of nodes for every interface instead of custom cards in a card cage, the hardware costs are dramatically lower as well, only 40-60% of comparable centralized systems. Using commercial Ethernet parts integrated into the existing IPDR node processor and interface boards successful proof of concept testing was performed during Phase I.  The transfer of Ethernet data frames was demonstrated into the IPDR ring via a peripheral Ethernet device, from one IPDR node to another, and finally back out of the ring to the external Ethernet device. Figure 1 shows the setup of the final node-to-node Ethernet communication test. Although this testing verified the fundamental functionality of Ethernet communication on the IPDR ring avionics, there is significant effort remaining to mature this into a flight worthy avionics architecture .  The Phase II will investigate flight parts selection for the nodes, firmware development required to improve bandwidth, and flight qualification and delivery of a Ethernet version of an IPDR node.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Diurnal (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c32b-nwj8) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

  The MERRA-Land product, MSTUNXMLD or tavgU_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional diurnal at the native resolution. All collections from this group are at reduced horizontal resolution. 
  
    The data are on the GEOS-5 native 540 x 361 grid with 2/3&deg; longitude x 1/2&deg; latitude resolution. Data are archived in the HDF-EOS (Grid) format, based on HDF4.* [NACP Regional: National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Aggregated Gridded Model Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kasf-cwbw) - This data set provides two products that were derived from the recently published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis 1-degree terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs (Gridded 1-deg Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et al., 2013). The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional Synthesis - Description of Observations and Models.* [NACP Regional: Original Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8cxg-662q) - ABSTRACT: This data set contains the originally-submitted observation measurement data, terrestrial biosphere model output data, and inverse model simulations that various investigator teams contributed to the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis activities. The data set provides nine (9) data packages of remote sensing and ground observation measurements (OM) (MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP), MODIS net primary production (NPP), MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPar), MODIS leaf area index (LAI), MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), MODIS normalize difference vegetation index (NDVI), Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) forest biomass, National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) crop NPP, and Flux Anomaly). The data set also provides data packages of simulation results from 19 terrestrial biosphere models (TBM) and eight (8) inverse models (IM). The data packages are respectively OM, TBM, and IM data files listed in Tables 4-6. Each OM, TBM, and IM data package contains all of the original data (and documentation, if any) that the NACP Modeling and Synthesis Thematic Data Center (MAST-DC) acquired or received. These originally-submitted data were processed by the MAST-DC to produce the three standardized gridded data sets of carbon flux for inter-comparison purposes (see Related Data Products below). These original data and documentation are provided to allow users of the standardized gridded data products to be able to trace back to the data origins when needed. The Data Center (ORNL DAAC) transformed some of the originally-submitted data files to file formats that are more suitable for long-term archiving. For example, *.xlsx files were saved as *.csv, ERDAS Imagine files were converted to GeoTIFFs, and MATLAB files were converted to GeoTIFF and NetCDF formats as appropriate. Files received in NetCDF, GeoTIFF, and HDF formats were not transformed.* [Three-Dimensional Cockpit Display System for Improved Situational Awareness, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bhti-r47g) - Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a 3D cockpit display (3D-COD) system for improved pilot situational awareness and safety in 3D airspace by overcoming the inherent limitations of 2D information presentation.  The proposed display will be automultiscopic and will be based on a projector, a stationary holographic optical element screen integrated with a high-speed electro-optical scanner and high-speed electronics with a software interface to NASA systems.  This minimum 8-in. diagonal drop-down head-up display with no moving parts will present six or more perspective views to air crew members, forming integrated virtual volumetric 3D images viewable over a 60 degree horizontal field of view.  In Phase I POC designed a laboratory prototype and successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed system by assembling a single-user monochrome 3D-COD prototype.  In Phase II POC will further develop the true 3D display technology and construct a fully functional system that will project distortion-free, 400-600 lumen, full-color, virtual volumetric 3D images at a 30-60 Hz video rate for real-time user interaction with the images, each from his or her own perspective.* [A Network of Multi-band Sensors for Radar Design, Deployment, and Diagnostics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mbs4-dctp) - Limitations on the design, monitoring and diagnosis of complex microwave systems due to insufficient models, the reality of imperfect physical conditions, and the reliance on trial-and-error iteration for system improvement serve to increase the time and costs of radar development. While microwave characterization is traditionally the realm of conventional, port-based measurements, the proposed concept suggests an alternative: the development of a novel network of electro-optic sensors that probe the near-field amplitude and phase of microwave signals at strategic locations within prototype or field-deployed radar systems. Such a sensor network, which would rely on optically-coupled, non-conductive, ultrawideband probes, would provide an unprecedented combination of negligible invasiveness, freedom from electrical interference, and the ability to capture signal information at frequencies from UHF to W-band. It would impact the development of virtually the entire range of technologies relevant to active microwave earth-science instruments. The proposed program will thus lead to the development of an instrument that can aid in areas such as deployment, calibration, and phase correction in large arrays, as well as in the identification of sources of electromagnetic-interference signals and the isolation of faults and failures.* [Global Cyclone Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f2cj-m2e5) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI) Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation (WASP). Utilizing average monthly precipitation data from 1980 through 2000 at a resolution of 2.5 degrees, WASP assesses the precipitation deficit or surplus over a three month temporal window that is weighted by the magnitude of the seasonal cyclic variation in precipitation. The three months' averages are derived from the precipitation data and the median rainfall for the 21 year period is calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells where the three month running average of precipitation is less than 1 mm per day ae excluded. Drought events are identified when the magnitude of a monthly precipitation deficit is less than or equal to 50 percent of its longterm median value for three or more consecutive months. Grid cells are then divided into 10 classes having an approximately equal number of grid cells. Higher grid cell values denote higher frequencies of drought occurrences. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Electrical Impedance Tomography Technology](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vpps-9q2h) - <p>The goal for the&nbsp;Electrical Impedance Tomography Technology (EITT) project is to develop a reliable portable, lightweight device providing two-dimensional tomographic imaging of the human body using impedance mapping.

Validation of such predictions is an important but difficult proposition and a lack of appropriate evaluation methods renders prognostics meaningless. Evaluation methods currently used in the research community are not standardized and in many cases do not sufficiently assess key performance aspects expected out of a prognostics algorithm. In this paper we introduce several new evaluation metrics tailored for prognostics and show that they can effectively evaluate various algorithms as compared to other conventional metrics. Four prognostic algorithms, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Polynomial Regression (PR), are compared. These algorithms vary in complexity and their ability to manage uncertainty around predicted estimates. Results show that the new metrics rank these algorithms in a different manner; depending on the requirements and constraints suitable metrics may be chosen. Beyond these results, this paper offers ideas about how metrics suitable to prognostics may be designed so that the evaluation procedure can be standardized.* [Distributed Rocket Engine Testing Health Monitoring System, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tfxc-qk4s) - Leveraging the Phase I achievements of the Distributed Rocket Engine Testing Health Monitoring System (DiRETHMS) including its software toolsets and system building blocks, the Phase II project seeks a comprehensive prototyping of the technology. Phase II not only expands the functionality and applications of the Phase I achievements, but utilizes evolving diagnostics due to the advanced intelligent algorithms built on AGNC's Optimized Neuro-Genetic Fast Estimator (ONGFE) framework. In this way, the Phase II effort culminates in a product that is able to adapt to unknown operating conditions and learn new failures in an unsupervised way. Additionally, a major effort consists of providing a novel, robust, and embedded software toolset for sensor Failure Detection and Identification (FDI): Sensor Data Validation and Self-Healing Scheme (SDV-SHS). To increase the commercialization potential and market values of the NASA and non-NASA applications, the Phase II project adapts DiRETHMS to the market requirements. The work in Phase II along with a modular architecture and standardization ensures a solid integration with NASA's Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) for enhanced health monitoring.* [Application of Advanced Electromagnetic Arrays to High Efficiency, High Bandwidth, Redundant Linear Actuators, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/iv52-hair) - There is a need to develop electromechanical actuators to improve
performance beyond that of hydraulic devices currently being used in
numerous aerospace and industrial applications. Beginning with NASA-provided performance specifications, this Phase I SBIR effort has employed a systems approach to develop and optimize the design of an electromechanical linear actuator appropriate for demanding launch vehicle thrust vector and control surface applications. The actuator system design consists of a high-efficiency permanent magnet motor with redundant current channels for system fault tolerance, multiple high-bandwidth controllers that are matched to motor characteristics, and a compact roller-screw mechanism, along with housing and supporting elements. A system of innovations was necessary to overcome the inherent limitations of today's electromechanical actuators, which were developed based on the limitations of traditional motors, power electronics, and available actuator hardware. The projected weight of the actuator prototype to be built in Phase II is less than the existing hydraulic systems currently in use by NASA, and half of previous electric prototypes having the same performance specification. Working with a major aerospace company partner, the Phase II Team will deliver a tested prototype actuator system as a basis for future advanced commercial products.* [Integrated Endurance and Resistance Exercise Countermeasures Using a Gravity Independent Training Device](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cjtz-ke26) - This study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of a new exercise device, multi-mode exercise device or M-MED, for use during long-duration space flights for the maintenance of cardiovascular and musculoskeletal fitness of astronauts. The M-MED is gravity independent and provides both the high force resistance and low force rowing type resistance. To date the results indicate that foot forces in resistance mode exercise on M-MED are similar to those seen using free weight exercises.     
Electromyography (EMG) studies demonstrate that similar activation levels are seem in key muscles during either M-MED based or free weight resistance exercise. EMG during rowing demonstrate that the thigh, leg, and arm muscles are robustly activated. Endurance mode exercise was also found to stimulate recruitment of the muscles which support the spine. In a recently completed study, 32 subjects (16 male, 16 female) completed 5 weeks of combined resistance and endurance training using the M-MED. Muscle strength increased ~20% while aerobic fitness measured as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) increased ~8%. M-MED training increased time to hand grip fatigue by ~70% and leg extension fatigue by ~27%. Thigh muscle cross sectional area increased ~11% as a result of training. Additional deliverables include cross validation of VO2max testing results between the M-MED device and laboratory standard cycle ergometry based testing protocols. As requested by NASA, additional studies have demonstrated that M-MED based exercise can increase the size and strength of the calf and hamstrings muscle groups. These results demonstrate that the M-MED device can be used for both training and physical work capacity testing providing a platform for in-flight assessment.     
In summary, findings to date indicate that the gravity independent M-MED is a viable option for resistance- and endurance-mode exercise during flight and/or planetary exploration thereby addressing two critical risks: 1) Cardiovascular deconditioning; 2) Decreased muscle strength, endurance, and size (atrophy). Endurance mode exercise may have the added benefit of maintaining and, possibly, improving endurance of arm muscles of flight crews as well as aiding in the maintenance of lower back stability and loading during flight and planetary exploration.

Unfortunately, they are limited in terms of their heat flux capability, approximately 5W/cm2.  Incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2.  This is a severe limitation for axial groove (CCHP) as well as loop heat pipes (LHP).  Standard CCHPs are also not suitable for Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, since they can only operate with a very small adverse elevation, on the order of 0.10 inch.  Landers can have tilts of ±20<SUP>o</SUP>, while rovers can have tilts of ±45<SUP>o</SUP>.  As a result, a wick with a higher heat flux capability and pumping capability is required.  This program will develop heat pipes with both 1) Sintered wicks, and 2) Hybrid grooved and sintered wicks.  Heat pipes with both wick designs will be capable of operating at heat fluxes in the ten's of watts per cm2, and in Lunar or Martian environments at large slopes against gravity.  An all-sintered wick will be used when the entire heat pipe must be able to operate against gravity, while a hybrid wick will be used when the condensers will always be gravity aided on the planetary surface.* [High Rate Tellecommunications for Mars Planetary and Proximity Ranges and other Deep-Space Missions-A, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2kcq-75gq) - Space vehicles for deep space exploration rely on microwave and millimeter wave links for communication with earth stations. As the mission of space probes expands, the data rate to be transmitted increases, and effective, compact, methods of modulating the RF carrier with high-speed data become a critical necessity.  Passive MMIC modulation approaches introduce loss into the RF path and analog phase shifters in particular can exhibit significant shortcomings such as insertion loss variations and phase-shift range limitations. For more complex digital or hybrid modulation schemes, passive modulator components may also need elaborate calibration look-up tables to achieve desired phase and amplitude modulation accuracy with respect to process and temperature variations. Hittite has recently developed high-performance, active I/Q vector modulator MMICs for communication systems operating up to C-band, based on SiGe and GaAs HBT process technologies. As part of this program, we propose to apply similar circuit techniques together with more advanced device technologies to develop high-performance active vector modulators for both X- and Ka-band frequencies.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Final Orbit Product (daily files, generated weekly) from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/aeez-xv4i) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Final Orbit Product (daily files, generated weekly) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS final combined orbit products. The final products are considered the most consistent and highest quality IGS solutions; they consist of daily orbit files, generated on a weekly basis with a delay up to 13 (for the last day of the week) to 20 (for the first day of the week) days. All orbit solution files utilize the extended standard product-3 (SP3c) format and span 24 hours from 00:00 to 23:45 UTC.* [Improved Forecasting of Solar Particle Events and their Effects on Space Electronics, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a3yx-miyc) - High-energy space radiation from Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events (SPEs) pose significant risks to equipment and astronaut health in NASA missions. Energetic particles from SPEs associated with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may adversely affect not only beyond-Low-Earth-Orbit missions, but also aircraft avionics, communications, and airline crew/passenger health. It is crucial to develop a capability to forecast SPEs and their effects on systems to guide planning of mission-related tasks and risk mitigation strategies.
CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC), University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), and Vanderbilt University (VU) propose to develop a comprehensive forecasting capability - SPE Forecast (SPE4) - comprising state-of-the-art modules integrated within a novel computational framework. SPE4 will include: (a) the MAG4 code for probability forecasts of flares/CMEs, and SPEs, (b) the PATH code for solar particle transport through the heliosphere, (c) Geant4-based transport calculations including geomagnetic modulation and atmospheric interactions (for avionics) to yield spectra of SPE-induced energetic protons/heavy ions, interfaced to (d) the CR?ME96 code for calculation of resulting effects in electronics. 
In Phase I, we demonstrated the superior capability of MAG4, PATH, and Geant4 for their respective tasks using a prior solar event case. A controller script was developed for automated code execution and data transfer across interfaces. Functionality of the overall event-to-effects capability was demonstrated using the 28-Sep-2012 event. We developed a concept of the final software product for NASA based on client-server architecture. In Phase II, we will collaborate with VU to interface calculated particle spectra with CR?ME96 to determine single-event effects in electronics. We will enhance robustness, accuracy, and execution speed via improved models and procedures, and demonstrate the software for persistent 24x7 SPE monitoring.* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/85yv-vq83) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard 

total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and 

volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. 

(2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined 

using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational 

GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per 

grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional 

economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the 

range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is 

generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia 

University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank, and 

Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Advanced Propeller Flow Control for Increased Propulsive Efficiency, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9ty6-qh4z) - An important mission for NASA is the development of revolutionary flight concepts and technology.  The development of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), the resurgence of general aviation, and growing interest in environmentally conscious, all-electric, emissionless aircraft have brought about a renewed interest in propeller design.  Overall, since the propeller's golden age during the WWII era, very little has changed in propeller design.  Computers have automated the design processes, but the basic design methodology, from an aerodynamic point of view has changed very little.  Strides have been made in acoustics and multidisciplinary optimization (MDO), but the basic aerodynamic design and performance of the subsonic propeller has basically remained unchanged.  The explosion of UAVs and a need for more efficient designs allowing greater payload, range, and loiter times have taken UAVs from simple cut-and-try designs to sophisticated, aerodynamically efficient systems.  An area as of yet not fully exploited by this class of aircraft, is that of propeller efficiency.  Most smaller UAVs and micro-UAVs simply use off-the-shelf radio control propellers, while moderate size UAVs rely on propellers designed using classical blade element theory or those derived for general aviation aircraft.  While these propellers provide industry acceptable levels of thrust for a given torque, the majority of propellers suffer some form of flow separation.  The extent of flow separation can range from small areas in cruise regions of the flight envelope, to large areas during climb and wind milling.  Significant propeller performance gains in the form of increased thrust and reduced torque can be obtained by eliminating these separated regions across the flight envelope.  A simple, efficient, and robust flow control technique is proposed to eliminate these separated regions and provide a marked increase in propeller performance and vehicle propulsive performance.* [Broadband Phase Shifter for High Contrast Nulling Interferometry](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g2zw-psnk) - <p>All approaches to starlight suppression are subject to spectral bandpass limitations. For nulling interferometers (&ldquo;nullers&rdquo;), the issue lies in achieving broadband symmetry between destructively interfering beams. In this effort we propose to improve upon the use of Fresnel rhombs as achromatic phase shifters (APS) for broadband high contrast nulling interferometry by adding dielectric coatings to each rhomb. These components will be characterized along with a fiber bundle spatial filter array (SFA) that is used for complex wavefront control.&nbsp; These components (the APS and SFA) are used in parallel to ultimately reach contrasts needed for Earth-like exoplanet detection.</p><p>The objectives of this project include 1) designing and tolerancing a new set of coated Fresnel rhomb APS that will, in theory, improve broadband peformance by over two orders of magnitude compared to a previous generation set of APS, 2) procuring one or more symmetric sets of APS and fabricating new mounting hardware, and 3) measuring and verifying the performance of the APS. The end goal or product is to produce an enhanced set of optics that improve the performance of the current, uncoated APS rhombs by two to three orders of magnitude, for use in testing with future demonstrations of the Segmented Aperture Interferometric Nulling Testbed (SAINT), which uses the Visible Nulling Coronagraph (VNC) for high-contrast source suppression. This is a technology maturation effort for missions such as the Habitable Exoplanet Imager (HabEx) or a future large aperture UV/Optical/IR telescope (LUVOIR) Surveyor.&nbsp; The innovative elements include a fabrication scheme that yields symmetric optics, and a test regiment that can measure prism angles with sub-arcsecond precision and retardance to micro-radian precision.</p>* [Highly Durable Catalysts for Ignition of Advanced Monopropellants, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/waen-wphd) - Monopropellants are readily ignited or decomposed over a bed of solid catalyst.

The proposed sensor builds on previous liquid hydrogen sensor development successes and patents.  It can be utilized to measure cryogenic propellants, and sub-critical cryogenic fluids in use on a wide range of space applications and in ground applications to monitor fluids ranging from liquid oxygen to MMH and N2O4.  The LMG can also indicate the presence of contaminants such as nitrogen used to purge the system. The current methods use either wire resistance measurements, capacitance or point sensors, combined with pressure and temperature measurements.  The LMG will be lighter, require less energy to operate, and provide less heat leak than existing technologies. Current techniques will not function correctly in boiling or stratified liquid cryogens or in reduced gravity. During phase I, Proof-of Concept experiments will be performed with liquid oxygen. Commercial applications in the home health care industry have been identified.* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 Total Column Ozone Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nwi9-mstf) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 Total Column Ozone Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012).

The ability to detect and quickly locate and mitigate a pressure vessel breach is critical to the safety of any long duration spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or a proposed lunar base or mission to Mars.  Current NASA protocol for finding a spacecraft leak uses a handheld ultrasonic directional microphone, similar to those widely deployed industrially, to detect the 40 kHz airborne ultrasonic hiss generated by the downstream leak turbulence.  However, known limitations exist regarding the use of airborne ultrasonic emissions for locating leaks in the spacecraft environment because the downstream side of the leak occurs into the vacuum of space, creating reduced leak noise inside the pressure vessel.  Blockages of the transmission of airborne ultrasonic energy by structural components, avionics, and equipment racks also limit the detection range of such systems.  An alternative approach that we propose is to monitor the spacecraft structure itself---the pressure vessel skin---for leak-generated surface-borne ultrasound by means of a flexible and modular electronics package with fully integrated surface sensor arrays, data acquisition electronics, and radio frequency communication capabilities.* [NACP Site: Terrestrial Biosphere Model and Aggregated Flux Data in Standard Format](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pu3p-kkgt) - This data set provides standardized output variables for gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), leaf area index (LAI), ecosystem respiration (Re), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H) from 24 terrestrial biosphere models for 47 eddy covariance flux tower sites in North America.

TRMM was successfully launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.

The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a nine-channel passive microwave radiometer, which builds on the heritage of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument flown aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. Microwave radiation is emitted by the Earth&apos;s surface and by water droplets within clouds. However, when layers of large ice particles are present in upper cloud regions - a condition highly correlated with heavy rainfall - microwave radiation tends to scatter at frequencies above 19 GHz. The TMI detects radiation at five frequencies chosen to discriminate among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood of rainfall. The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by this method is the deduction of cloud precipitation consistent with the radiation measurement at each frequency. The TMI frequencies are 10.65, 19.35, 37 and 85.5 GHz (dual polarization), and 21 GHz (vertical polarization only).

The Level 1A product file (1A11) is a concatenation of the Level 0 data with a header record and, as such, is reversible to Level 0. The header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbit number, times of the first scan and number of scans, among other things. The Level 0 data contain the actual channel data expressed as &quot;sensor counts.&quot; A file contains data for a single orbit with a file size of about 7 MB (uncompressed).  There are 16 files of TMI 1A11 data produced per day.

Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.

Some of the most exciting technologies that require nanometer scale features include disk drives and memory storage devices, light-emitting diodes, solar energy devices, and microarrays for genomics, proteomics, and tissue engineering applications. Along with new advances in this field comes the challenge to enable the reliable, low-cost manufacture of these technologies in order to bring this fascinating science to the general public. Currently, nanopatterning is often carried out using various lithography techniques. Despite their successes in many applications, one of the challenges facing such lithographic methods is their inability to generate patterns smaller than 20nm in a way that is reliable, cost-effective and rapid enough for industrial-scale manufacturing processes. Understanding how to overcome these engineering hurdles is the reason for my interest in self-assembly as a chemical engineering graduate student. In short, I am interested in developing strategies to induce nanometer scale particles to arrange themselves into specific patterns required for the aforementioned technological applications.

There are plenty of examples that illustrate the possibilities of self-assembly, both in nature (DNA, protein folding, etc.) and through artificial means. However, it is also widely appreciated that self-assembly processes involving nanoparticles are limited in terms of the number of large-scale, low-defect structures that they can produce under various thermodynamics conditions. If the true potential of nanotechnology is to be reached, we must uncover ways to reach any desired structure. This is where "directed" self-assembly can be useful. It is possible, for example, to use traditional lithographic techniques to create a pattern on a significantly coarser lengthscale than the desired structure that helps to direct the self-assembly of particles on a finer scale (pattern multiplication). My research proposal will seek to elucidate the possibilities and limitations of this method of directed self-assembly. Specifically, the goal of this project will be to create computational tools that help discover new directed self-assembly strategies for scalable nanomanufacturing.

The aim of this project is to use computational tools taken from inverse statistical mechanics to allow for a "bottom up" design of nanomaterials. Traditionally, the forward method of equilibrium statistical mechanics predicts bulk properties given knowledge about particle interactions. Conversely, the inverse methods allow an investigator to determine the particle interactions that yield desired material properties. Whit this theoretical framework, it is possible to design a material's macroscopic behavior by taking advantage of the ability to tune nanoparticle interactions (design from the bottom up).

For this proposal, the focus will be on the design of materials through the use of two-dimensional patterning of nanoparticles on a substrate. With a pre-patterned substrate, it is possible to influence nanoparticles assemble into various structures. I intend to investigate the minimum amount of existing scaffolding required to allow nanoparticles to build the desired defect-free pattern (i.e., how much direction is required for directed self-assembly). In the end, I hope to create a design strategy for the creation the coarse length scale designs that can direct self-assembly of more detailed nanoscale patterns.* [Onboard Detection of Snow, Ice, Clouds, and Other Processes](https://data.nasa.gov/d/42ue-eijd) - The detection of clouds within a satellite image is essential for retrieving surface geophysical parameters from optical and thermal imagery. Even a small percentage of cloud cover within a radiometer pixel can adversely affect the determination of surface variables such as albedo and temperature. Thus, onboard processing of satellite data requires reliable automated cloud detection algorithms that are applicable to a wide range of surface types. Unfortunately cloud-detection, particularly over snow- and ice-covered surfaces, is a problem that plagues the field of remote sensing because of the lack of spectral contrast.
This paper discusses preliminary results based on kernel methods for unsupervised discovery of snow, ice, clouds, and other geophysical processes based on data from the MODIS instrument and discusses implementation in computationally constrained environments such as those found on satellites.* [A Novel Low-Cost Dual-Wavelength Precipitation Radar Sensor Network, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ktw8-sezx) - NASA is committed to measuring precipitation on a global scale. In 1997,
NASA launched the Tropical Rain Measuring Mission which carried the
first spaceborne precipitation radar (PR). Operating at 13.8 GHz, the PR
demonstrated the potential of spaceborne radars to map global
precipitation. To improve rainfall estimates, the next generation system
being proposed for the NASA Global Precipitation Mission is a
dual-wavelength (Ku/Ka-band) precipitation radar (DPR). Operating at Ku
and Ka-band, it will yield additional information on the drop size
distribution (DSD). Advanced ground-based Ku/Ka-band DPR systems are
needed to develop and validate the retrieval algorithms that will be
used by GPM. This proposed Phase I effort will investigate the required
innovations to design and construct a novel, low-cost, scanning,
dual-polarized DPR senor and sensor network. The focus will be on
developing a low-cost ruggedized compact antenna, transceiver, power
amplifier and real-time processing and communication subsystems. This
advanced DPR sensor network will provide unprecedented spatial/temporal
sampling and coverage and multiple methods to determine DSD:
polarization, differential extinction, multi-look radar measurements of
extinction. As a sensor network, limitations due to earth curvature,
topography and ground clutter that affect the existing weather radar
infrastructure can be overcome.* [Investigation of the Hall Effect Thruster Breathing Mode and Spoke Mode Instabilities in the Very Near Field](https://data.nasa.gov/d/766g-3d6i) - One of the most practical forms of electric propulsion is the Hall Effect Thruster (HET), which makes use of electric and magnetic fields to create and eject a plasma. One of the most common HET designs is the stationary plasma thruster, in which an annular channel acts as an ionization zone where a radial magnetic field and axial electric field establish an electron Hall current. Despite the prevalence of this design in university and commercial settings, the physical mechanisms governing its operation are still not entirely understood.

I propose to conduct research involving time-resolved plasma measurements in the very-near field of a modern high-power Hall thruster. The goal of this research is to directly observe the variation of plasma properties in the ionization zone of a Hall thruster so as to quantitatively characterize some of the major instabilities known to occur in these devices. In doing this, the impact of these instabilities on performance can be determined, providing the insight needed to design more efficient Hall thrusters. The two main types of instabilities that I plan to examine are the spoke and breathing mode instabilities. These two turbulent effects originate in the ionization zone of a Hall thruster and generally occur with frequencies on the order of tens of kilohertz. To capture these effects in any capacity, time-resolved diagnostic tools must be employed. Although these instabilities have been examined before, there is limited data characterizing them in a time-resolved manner and virtually no existing data doing so in the very-near field. For each instability, I propose to examine its steady-state behavior, origin, and effect on thruster performance.

This research will be conducted at the Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion Laboratory (PEPL), where the material and personnel resources are well-suited for facilitating the proposed research. PEPL has the 6-m diameter, 9-m long cylindrical stainless steel clad Large Vacuum Test Facility, which has a pumping speed of 240,000 L/s on xenon using LN2 baffled cryopanels. To evaluate thruster efficiency, I will require diagnostic tools such as a Faraday probe, ExB probe, and retarding potential analyzer. These will allow me to measure current density profiles, current as a function of degree of ionization, and acceleration voltage. These quantities can then be used to determine various efficiencies, including mass utilization efficiency, current utilization efficiency, and divergence efficiency, as outlined by Liang and Gallimore.

For time-resolved measurements, I propose to use a high-speed dual Langmuir probe (HDLP). Technical limitations for a single Langmuir probe generally prevent it from being swept at frequencies greater than 0.01 to 70 kHz for a Hall thruster plasma. A HDLP can be used to identify time-resolved electron density, potential, and ion flux in the channel, and has been used to do so sweeping at up to 400 kHz. This represents the highest frequency full sweep data published to date, providing unheard of temporal resolution.

In-space propulsion is a major element of NASA's Technology Area Breakdown Structure (TABS), and specifically electric propulsion is a significant component of the In-Space Propulsion Systems Roadmap (ISPSR). The proposed research is therefore highly relevant in that it not only uses electric propulsion devices for a proposed investigation of plasma physics but it is intended to improve Hall thruster efficiency. In the ISPSR, two of the top three technical challenges highlighted are electric propulsion related. In particular, one of these challenges is related to high-power solar electric propulsion. The proposed research aims to explore the physics underpinning instabilities in Hall thrusters, and thus has the goal to provide new insight for next-generation Hall thruster designs. For this reason it will enable the development high-power solar Hall thruster propulsion solutions.* [Transcutaneous Noninvasive Device for the Responsive Delivery of Melatonin in Microgravity., Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yh9i-8sj9) - Our goal is develop a smart, transcutaneous device for individualized circadian (sleep) therapy by responsive release of melatonin, in microgravity.  Additionally, this concept ?shown in figure 1?is modular and multifunctional by design.  So, with minimal changes, we envision being able to use same device for the controlled release of other medicines and nutrients, in space as well as on Earth.  For space-travel, a variety of countermeasures must be developed to oppose the harmful effects of longterm flights and exposures to other gravitational fields.  Furthermore, each astronaut responds to a certain medicine or combination of medicines in a unique manner.  Circadian disruption, or acute (chronic) degradation of sleep quality or quantity, is a known risk during space-flight.

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

The MERRA-Land product, MST1NXMLD or tavg1_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional time averaged single-level at the native resolution. All collections from this group are at reduced horizontal resolution.

The data are on the GEOS-5 native 540 x 361 grid with 0.667 degree longitude x 0.5 degree latitude resolution. Data are archived in the HDF-EOS2 (Grid) format, based on HDF4.

It was calibrated to apparent surface reflectance using the ACORN atmospheric model.The Hyperion imager has a spectral range of 400-2500 nm, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, spatial resolution of 30 m, and a swath width of 7.8 km. Sampling is scene based (256 samples, 512 lines) (http://eo1.usgs.gov/sensors.php).  Through these large number of spectral bands, complex land ecosystems can be imaged and accurately classified.Data from the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer may greatly increase our ability to estimate the presence and structural attributes of selective logging in the Amazon Basin using four biogeophysical indicators not yet derived simultaneously from any satellite sensor: 1) green canopy leaf area index; 2) degree of shadowing; 3) presence of exposed soil and; 4) non-photosynthetic vegetation material. Airborne, field and modeling studies have shown that the optical reflectance continuum (400-2500 nm) contains sufficient information to derive estimates of each of these indicators. Our ongoing studies in the eastern Amazon basin also suggest that these four indicators are sensitive to logging intensity. Satellite-based estimates of these indicators should provide a means to quantify both the presence and degree of structural disturbance caused by various logging regimes.* [Avatar Robot for Crew Performance and Behavioral Health](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ed2q-c3rc) - <p>This project investigates the effectiveness of using an avatar robotic platform as a crew assistant and a family member substitute. This type of avatar robot is particularly useful for maintaining crew behavioral health during long-term crew isolation. An avatar robot is both a physical and graphical representation of a person at a remote location and acts as a surrogate for that person.  The teleoperated avatar robot can interact with its environment on behalf of the person not present, thus providing physical and psychological assistance to others. The robot offers real-time motion control as well as speech and video communication with the people and environment at the remote site.  It can be equipped with remotely controlled manipulator arms to carry out tasks. Such a platform can be deployed on the ISS and other future near-Earth habitats, enabling the ground crew to assist the onboard crew on tasks. For facilitating crew behavioral health, the robot can be controlled by, for example, a crew family member and thus can act as a surrogate for the family member.  Similiarly, the crew can also control the robot at his/her home to provide closer interactions with his/her family members. Currently, the impact of such a system to the crew's behavioral health is unknown.  The proposal avatar robot platform can also be used to develop an ideal human/robot control/command interface; effectively controlling/commanding such a robot with multi-modal parallel outputs still requires much research. We will develop an avatar robot platform and perform preliminary evaluations to assess its potential benefits as a remote human surrogate for space-related applications.</p>* [Development of a Radiation Hardened CZT Sensor Array and 1U CubeSat Flight Test (>TRL 6), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pe9u-qfsz) - Instruments employing X-ray, gamma ray and particle detection are utilized in different sectors from medicine to industry and from basic to applied science. The solid-state detector array with detection ASIC is the primary technology of space-based high-energy astronomy missions that are managed by NASA in partnership with the international community1,2. A readout integrated circuitry (ROIC) specifically designed for photon resolving X-ray detection has been developed by Black Forest Engineering on prior NASA SBIR funding3. The BFE322 ROIC, bump bonded to a CdZnTe (CZT) 16x32 detector array, demonstrated single photon sensitivity, accurate X-ray energy determination, X-ray event time stamping, and low power dissipation (< 10 &#956;W per pixel) at ambient temperature operation; this represents a significant advancement in detection capability. The proposed Phase I improves ROIC performance by using low 1/f noise 250 nm CMOS, in-pixel amplifier tuning to match detector capacitance and rad-hard-by-design (RHBD) to provide >500 kRad radiation tolerance. The Phase I design will be a 32x32 pixel format with 600 µm pixel pitch compatible with CZT and silicon detector arrays. The ROIC will be fabricated and hybridized to CZT on Phase II and demonstrated using a PocketQube or CubeSat mini-satellite test flight to establish a TRL> 6.* [Self-Powered Magnetothermal Fluid Pump, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9r2e-cp5e) - The ability to successfully manage thermal loads is increasingly a primary design constraint for many emerging engineered systems.  Systems ranging from military aircraft to computational platforms to photovoltaic (PV) power generation all generate unwanted heat and traditional methods for transporting and removing this heat are often heavy, cumbersome, power hungry, or lack adequate heat removal capacity.  Excess heat can result in reduced efficiency in PV systems, limit duty cycles for pulsed power applications, and ultimately cause failure of critical components if not managed properly.  Similar problematic scenarios exist for many power generation systems, high power radio frequency (RF) devices, portable electronics, and lasers, to name a few.
	A host of thermal management techniques are currently available including heat pipes, liquid immersion, jet impingement and sprays, thermoelectric coolers, and refrigeration.  While these techniques are adequate in some cases, none of these methods alone can meet the needs of future high power thermal management without incurring large penalties of weight, power, or volume.  The technology proposed here overcomes these limitations through autonomic, self-powered, and self-cooling functionality by directly converting the unwanted thermal energy into useable mechanical energy for use in coolant pumps or refrigeration compressors.* [MeshSLAM: Robust Localization and Large-Scale Mapping in Barren Terrain, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ee3w-9w8m) - Robots need to know their location to map of their surroundings but without global positioning data they need a map to identify their surroundings and estimate their location. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solves these dual problems at once. SLAM does not depend on any kind of infrastructure and is thus a promising localization technology for NASA planetary missions and for many terrestrial applications as well. However, state-of-the-art SLAM depends on easily-recognizable landmarks in the robot's environment, which are lacking in barren planetary surfaces. Our work will develop a technology we call MeshSLAM, which constructs robust landmarks from associations of weak features extracted from terrain. Our test results will also show that MeshSLAM applies to all environments in which NASA's rovers could someday operate: dunes, rocky plains, overhangs, cliff faces, and underground structures such as lava tubes. Another limitation of SLAM for planetary missions is its significant data-association problems. As a robot travels it must infer its motion from the sensor data it collects, which invariably suffers from drift due to random error. To correct drift, SLAM recognize when the robot has returned to a previously-visited place, which requires searching over a great deal of previously-sensed data. Computation on such a large amount of memory may be infeasible on space-relevant hardware. MeshSLAM eases these requirements. It employs topology-based map segmentation, which limits the scope of a search. Furthermore, a faster, multi-resolution search is performed over the topological graph of observations. Mesh Robotics LLC and Carnegie Mellon University have formed a partnership to commercially develop MeshSLAM. MeshSLAM technology will be available via open source, to ease its adoption by NASA. In Phase 1 of our project we will show the feasibility of MeshSLAM for NASA and commercial applications through a series of focused technical demonstrations.* [An Intelligent Strain Gauge with Debond Detection and Temperature Compensation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3uen-st3n) - <p>The harsh rocket propulsion test environment exposes any inadequacy associated with preexisting instrumentation technologies, can critically affect the collection of reliable test data, and justifies investigating any encountered data anomalies.  Novel concepts for improved system assessments are often conceived during the high scrutiny investigations by individuals with an in-depth knowledge from maintaining critical test operations.  The intelligent strain gauge concept developed for this project was conceived while performing these kinds of activities. Ordinary gauges are designed to provide test article data but they lack the ability to supply information concerning the gauge itself. Changes to the gauge bond integrity are observable in the thermal dissipation rate. A gauge is considered to be a "smart gauge" when it provides supplementary data relating Instrument attributes for performing diagnostic function or producing enhanced data.  Accordingly, a gauge with the ability to temporarily self-heat and monitor the rate at which the thermal dissipation occurs can indicate a gauge debond. This project developed novel strain gauge designs that enabled the detection of gauge debonding, and provided for temperature compensation of strain measurements. The improvement to the gauge increased instrument functionality and data collection capability. Two types of fully functional smart strain gauges capable of performing reliable and sensitive debond detection were successfully produced.  <p/><p>To improve instruments functionality in a harsh rocket propulsion test environment, this project developed an intelligent strain gauge.  The initial design for this project was a novel foil strain gauge with the capability to measure strain and temperature (Type 1).  The novel foil strain gauge pattern features the integration of a silicon-diode temperature sensor and a self-heating element. The silicon-diode sensor provides the gauge temperature for performing real-time temperature compensation algorithms. The silicon-diode temperature sensor was used in the initial gauge pattern due to its enhanced abilities, but after refinement, resistive temperature element was then embedded into a second gauge pattern (Type 2). Then, the debond detection function was tested by monitoring the temperature of the gauge while the gauge was heated and cooled. The temperature signature (rate of heating/cooling) from the gauge was analyzed for both bonded and debonded gauges. Finally, a small control circuit was created with the capability to self-execute a bond integrity check, and perform real-time temperature compensation was also added. By combining the control circuit with the special gauge the smart gauge was converted into a fully functioning intelligent sensor system.</p>* [OpenSWIFT-SDR for STRS, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/he6q-g4vv) - The OpenSWIFT-SDR Phase II effort will build upon our highly successful Phase I effort by extending the capabilities of the SWIFT-SDR platform and develop technologies needed for NASA?s next generation satellite communication architecture. The SWIFT software defined radio is a proven, SWaP-C (size, weight, power, and cost) efficient RF communications, signal processing, and general computing platform delivering on-orbit reprogrammability and flexibility for space missions. TUI plans to investigate and implement cognitive radio technologies on the SWIFT platform that will reduce mission planning and mission implementation costs by providing a standardized, robust, hardware and software platform that can dynamically adjust to a rapidly changing space communications environment. By using the mature SWIFT radio as a basis for integrating these solutions, and implementing NASA's STRS standard for radio software, TUI is in a strong position to continue research and develop cognitive radio solutions that benefit a wide variety of NASA science missions and future radio customers through tested, reusable, and portable software and firmware.* [Conformal Carbon Nanotubes for Stray Light Suppression](https://data.nasa.gov/d/83yi-g96c) - <p>We have developed ultra-black CVD (chemical vapor deposition) and embedded carbon nanotube surface treatments for use in the near UV to far infrared for stray light suppression, near-ideal radiators and calibrators and detector absorbers.  We propose to develop techniques using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and electric field alignment to apply nanotubes to non-flat substrates to broaden their utilization to many additional components for space flight use.<p/><p>Our objective is to apply CVD and non-CVD carbon nanotubes to complex shapes that numerous scientists have requested for stray light control.  Currently, CVD nanotubes can only be grown on flat surfaces due to limitations in line-of-sight physical vapor deposition techniques such as e-beam evaporation.   For CVD our adhesion and catalyst layers must be applied on the on the component with extreme uniformity to a thickness of 1 to 2 nm for ideal performance.   Then the component must be placed in the thermal reactor furnace flow in a way that allows uniform exposure to the carbon bearing gas.  Our first focus area is to utilize atomic layer deposition (ALD) to apply our adhesion and catalyst layers conforming to the desired substrate surface.  This will allow fabrication of components that are dark on all surfaces instead of just on one surface.</p>* [COxSwAIN COmpressive Sensing for Advanced Imaging and Navigation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v8mf-ayic) - A new imaging architecture that incorporates elements of compressive sensing and computational imaging in order to reevaluate the design space of imaging systems with the power and bandwidth constraints of small satellite platform is the subject of this task. In order to increase the technology readiness level of these systems, the program will utilize ground based development and balloon flights to demonstrate several imaging systems that fit the limitations of these small spacecraft (cubesats, picosats). Successful demonstration should enable new, low cost, science platforms as well as improvements in operations and communications of those power and bandwidth restricted spacecraft.* [Scalable Architectures for Distributed Beam-Forming Synthetic Aperture Radar (DBSAR), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mqej-9rcw) - Conventional SAR operates in the Stripmap mode. Wide unambiguous swath coverage and high azimuth resolution pose contradictory requirements on the design of SAR systems. A promising technique to overcome this limitation is Digital Beam-Forming (DBF) on receive where the receiving antenna is split into multiple sub-apertures. This provides the capability of forming multiple beams via post-processing. DBF techniques applied to SAR systems can increase receiving antenna gain without a reduction of the imaged area and suppress interference signals. A highly capable DBSAR instrument design would consist of wideband Transmitter-Receiver Module (TRM), precise multi-channel timing and synchronization and reconfigurable processing engine that can host the SAR processing, calibration and control routines. IAI's proposed approach is modular, scalable and meets the NASA goals of developing an innovative analog/digital hardware design for the implementation of distributed DBSAR architectures.* [Compact, Lightweight, Non-Venting, Phase-Change Heat Exchanger, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ensm-hgzc) - Future exploration spacecraft will need to operate in extreme thermal environments, with highly variable conditions for heat rejection by thermal radiation.  Thermal storage is a critical technology for these missions, since it enables the spacecraft's thermal management system to be sized for average conditions instead of the least favorable.  We propose a new technology for thermal storage based on an innovative, non-venting phase-change heat exchanger.  Creare's technology overcomes some of the key limitations of phase-change heat exchanger technology.  Our design maximizes the amount of phase-change material, eliminates large thermal resistances due to the poor thermal conductivity of the phase-change material, and accommodates differences in solid vs. liquid volume without a heavy structure.  In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of this approach through thermal, fluid, and structural analysis; assessment of critical trade-offs; proof-of-concept demonstrations; and design of a prototype phase-change heat exchanger sized to meet requirements for future space exploration missions.   In Phase II we will design, build, and demonstrate operation of the prototype phase-change heat exchanger.* [High Frequency Reflective Mesh for Small Aperture Antennas, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bkn4-dkwq) - The proposed Phase I program would develop and prototype a high frequency, high performance reflective mesh that is well suited to the emerging small aperture antenna designs.  The program will review heritage mesh architectures and trade them against new designs.  New materials and manufacturing methods will be evaluated with the goal of making low-cost mesh for CubeSat missions.  The mesh samples will be tested to determine their mechanical stiffness properties.  RF test samples will be delivered to NASA JPL.* [Lightweight High Energy Density Capacitors for NASA AMPS and PPUs, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qcsg-hrxu) - This NASA Phase I SBIR proposal addresses the development of lightweight, high energy density DC-link capacitors that are a key component of inverters used power processing units (PPUs). DC-link capacitors used in IGBT and MOSFET switching circuits are one of the largest and least reliable components in DC-DC and DC-AC inverter circuits. Tantalum capacitors used currently by NASA in such circuits, have significant parametric limitations in the temperature range of -125oC to >200oC.   This development proposes the replacement of electrolytic capacitors with high temperature, solid state, Polymer Multilayer (PML) capacitors that have been recently developed for automotive inverter applications.  PML polymer dielectrics can be used to produce capacitors with voltages in the range of 25V to 1000V.  The high temperature PML polymers are amorphous with very high breakdown strength and can operate in a temperature range of -196oC to >200oC.  PML capacitors are smaller than tantalums, they have 10X lower weight, lower leakage current, lower dissipation factor, lower inductance and lower equivalent series resistance (ESR).  The Phase I development will focus in producing and evaluating PML capacitors designed for PPUs utilized in Hall thrusters and roll-out PV arrays for solar electric propulsion.* [Advanced Cooled Shield - Integrated MLI: Passive or Active Cooled System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/h4wt-95nj) - Cryogenic propellants are important to NASA's missions. Improvements in cryogenic propellant storage and transfer are critical to future long duration NASA spacecraft and missions. Advanced Cooled Shield - IMLI (ACS-IMLI) is an innovative ultra high performance system in which an Advanced Cooled Shield is fully integrated into the IMLI layer structure, reducing mass, forming a single robust system, with integrated cooled gas distribution in a cooled shield layer, eliminating heat flux through thermal shield tank standoffs or supports, and operable in both passive (vapor cooled shield) and active (broad area cooled shield) modes.

NASA's TA-02 Roadmap calls "Zero Boil Off storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions" the #2 ranked technical challenge for NASA mission objectives and needs.  Quest Thermal Group has developed IMLI, an advanced thermal insulation that uses proprietary discrete spacer technology to reduce heat flux. IMLI's unique structure is able to self support various loads, including a thin, lightweight vacuum shell for in-air operation, high strength ballistic layers for MMOD shielding, an external Broad Area Cooling Shield with cooling tubing, or an integrated thermal shield within the layers. IMLI's layer structure gives it unique capabilities, such as an embedded conductive, sealed thermal barrier. 

In this Phase I program, an ACS-IMLI system would be modeled, analyzed, designed, fabricated, installed on a cryotank, and tested for structural strength and thermal performance.  Advanced Cooled Shield &#150; IMLI (ACS-IMLI) could provide a lower mass, single insulation system, operable in both passive (vapor cooled) and active (cryocooled) modes, with 3 &#150; 4X lower heat flux than IMLI alone. ACS-IMLI could help meet NASA's cryogenic fluid management requirements such as Zero Boil Off for cryogenic propellant storage and transfer.* [Fault Tree Generation and Augmentation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7rfg-crqn) - Fault Management (FM) is one of the key components of system autonomy.  In order to guarantee FM effectiveness and control the cost, tools are required to automate fault-tree generation and updates based on design models specified in standardized design languages such as AADL.  Accordingly, we propose a fault tree generation and augmentation environment (FTGA).  Equipped by a fault class model and an FM method catalog, FTGA evaluates not only failure behavior in the application under analysis but also FM's capability and adequacy for failure mitigation.  Moreover, when an inadequacy in FM is revealed during fault tree generation or analysis, the fault tree will be allowed for augmentation through FM method insertion and be followed by a quantitative evaluation for FM effectiveness validation.  Therefore, unlike traditional fault tree analysis which plays a passive role in FM, the automated FTGA environment actively and explicitly influence system design and updates, enabling "fault-tree-in-the-loop" for a system's life cycle.  Further, by separating its generic functions (which we collectively call "shared package") from design-language-specific functions (which we collectively call "interface package"), FTGA will be an extensible modeling environment.  The anticipated results from the Phase I project will be a preliminary prototype of FTGA and a demonstration for concept validation.* [Nanostructured Fiber Optic Cantilever Arrays and Hybrid MEMS Sensors for Chemical and Biological Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hnh5-8kyw) - Advancements in nano-/micro-scale sensor fabrication and molecular recognition surfaces offer promising opportunities to develop miniaturized hybrid fiber optic and MEMS-based sensors for in situ analysis of chemicals and microbial pathogens in spacecraft air and water.  Such sensors have extraordinary dual-use benefits in medical screening for early indication of certain cancers and rapid detection of weaponized chemical and biological agents for homeland defense.     

Returning humans to the moon and "worlds beyond" as directed in the 'Vision for Space Exploration' requires manned missions of increasing duration.  Increased mission duration invariably increases chemical and microbial contamination of spacecraft.  Ensuring crew health and optimal systems performance thus requires sensors to continuously monitor spacecraft advanced life support systems.  Presently, adequate sensors do not exist and crews must rely on labor-intensive techniques to ensure safety of drinking water and breathing air.  

In Phase I we demonstrated feasibility of miniaturized polymer-coated fiber-optic cantilever arrays for monitoring toxic vapors.  In Phase II we will develop next-generation hybrid cantilever and MEMS sensors for detection of various aerosolized chemical and biological contaminants at SMAC-relevant levels.  To facilitate implementation by NASA end-users, sensors will be integrated and demonstrated with existing NASA air sampling devices.  Phase III commercialization efforts are well underway.* [An On-Chip Nano-Plasmonics Based Urine Protein Assay Cartridge, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9vye-inyp) - Long-term exposure to microgravity and radiation during space exploration can pose a critical threat to the health of a flight crew. Real-time monitoring of urine protein levels is an effective way to follow the onset and progress of many diseases and guide the prompt selection of proper therapy. The success of such diagnostic tasks, which is strongly desired for flight missions, critically depends upon the degree of automation and reliability of such trace level detection. To meet this need, we propose to develop a novel on-chip, nano-plasmonic sensor cartridge to concurrently quantify the presence of different urine proteins. The envisioned device is compact, lightweight, fully integrated and automated, and highly cost- and power-effective. The program objectives will be accomplished via several innovations: (a) a new nano-plasmonics chip technology-based SPR sensor that is compatible with miniaturization, (b) tailored array modifications, allowing for concurrent screening of multiple proteins, (c) microfluidic platform for automated biochemical processes, and (d) simulation-based design for rapid prototype development. In Phase I, we will develop and demonstrate the critical microfluidic components (i.e., filter, mixer and network architecture) guided by physics-based simulations, and experimentally demonstrate the two-type-assay on a single nanoplasmonics chip for protein detection. The simulation-based design will conform to specifications that are amenable to mass-production-friendly lithographic techniques. In Phase II, the nano-plasmonic sensor will be optimized to increase sensitivity, stability, and the response to regular urine samples. Finally, the sensor will be integrated with microfluidic components and control/transmission electronics to form a portable protein assay cartridge.* [CER_BDS_NPP-FM5_Edition1-CV](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9c5v-f4zw) - CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data in HDF.* [CDDIS_GNSS_products_orbit_rapid](https://data.nasa.gov/d/27yt-c29q) - Precise satellite orbits derived from analysis of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce precise orbits identifying the position and velocity of the GNSS satellites. These orbits are determined sub-daily (ultra-rapid generation), daily (rapid generation), and weekly (final IGS product). The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator retrieves these individual solutions and generates the official IGS combined orbit products. The orbits generated by the individual ACs and the combination products generated by the ACCs are available at the CDDIS. These orbits can be used to determine precise coordinates of the observing stations, gravity field parameters, and Earth orientation parameters.* [SEDIMENT ANALYSIS NETWORK FOR DECISION SUPPORT (SANDS) LANDSAT GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF AL (GSA) ANALYSIS V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gfit-u9au) - The Geological Survey of Alabama (GSA) analyzed changes in the coastal shoreline and sedimentation using Landsat geotiff images as part of the Sediment Analysis Network for Decision Support (SANDS) project.  The daytime geotiffs images from Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 were analyzed for sediment re-distribution after a hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Alabama and part of the Florida area having coordinates 31 to 27 North latitude and 90 to 84.25 West longitude.  These are seasonal data for storms from 2001-2008.  In addition to the analyzed files, the data files include the ESRI files for zipped bands and grids, metadata, and storm temporal information for the sediment analysis images.* [Multi-Platform Sensor Surveillance Network for Range Control, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6g3v-9ygi) - Prioria (Gainesville, FL) and its partners Aerial Products (Deland, FL) and Meridian Systems LLC (Titusville, FL) propose to develop a revolutionary new type of system which is both modular and standardized, and which can effectively interface with existing sensors such as range radar and acoustic intrusion detectors.  The system for launch surveillance/intrusion detection is based on a network of uncooled long wavelength infrared (LWIR) imagers with associated Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors and magnetic compass heading indicators, integrated into a small  package which can be deployed on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), balloons or blimps, and fixed towers.  Infrared imagers are chosen for their day/night and all-weather capability and because recent advances in uncooled technology has allowed the price of these sensors to become low enough for fielding a relatively large number of imagers in a cost effective manner.
	These LWIR sensors and integrated instrumentation will provide for the remote detection, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded into areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations. In order to achieve accurate identification, the time and position of potential intrusions will be recorded in a "track file" for each detection incidence.  Data fusion techniques will fuse tracks from various sensors into a single track when possible, and objects will be tracked with multi-target tracking techniques as necessary. This will require the use of encrypted communication, so track data and associated intruder imagery from individual sensors can be combined at a centralized control station as a fused track file. In the cases where intrusions are deemed security risks, further action can be undertaken, such as deployment of a small UAV to the intrusion site for real time observation, while range control and security evaluate the situation.* [Atomic Interferometer Gravity Gradiometer Simulation Environment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3p3b-ze6m) - <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"

Pathophysiological manifestations after low-dose radiation exposure are strongly influenced by non-cytocidal radiation effects including microbiome and cellular gene expression. Using a mouse model for exposure to high LET radiation we observed substantial changes in the composition and functional potential of the microbiome. These were paralleled by changes in the abundance of multiple metabolites which were related to the enzymatic activity of the altered metagenome by means of metabolic network modeling. There was a complex dynamic in microbial and metabolic composition at different radiation doses suggestive of transient dose-dependent interactions between microbial ecology and signals from the host  s cellular damage repair processes. Functional shifts included features associated with dysbiosis at the onset of chronic inflammatory responses which could prMouse fecal microbiome after exposure to high LET radiatione-dispose space travelers to systemic long-term health risks.* [SEDIMENT ANALYSIS NETWORK FOR DECISION SUPPORT (SANDS) LANDSAT GEOTIFF V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w4iv-cut5) - The Sediment Analysis Network for Decision Support (SANDS) analyzes Geotiff images for sediment redistribution after a hurricane on the Gulf coast and then creates a product based on the analysis.  This dataset consists of the set of daytime geotiff images from Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 provided to Geological Survey of Alabama for their analysis.

Unfortunately, conventional technology developed over this time period has required a complex balance of plant that adds to the overall weight of the system package. Research in the past two decades resulted in the creation of systems that minimized balance of plant components, but had significant current density and efficiency limitations, limiting their use. This SBIR program builds upon recent success in the development of a high-pressure electrochemical cell architecture and inserts novel water management technology to generate a passive liquid feed electrolyzer capable of operating at 2,000 psi - and scalable to higher pressures. If successful, implementation of this new technology can save substantially on system weight with a high system operational efficiency and enhanced current density capability.* [Parallel Detection of Multiple Biomarkers During Spaceflight, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xa5f-427w) - Maintaining the health of astronauts during extended spaceflight is critical to the success of the mission.  Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (RMD) proposes an instrument to monitor astronauts' physiological responses to stress, microgravity, radiation, infection, and pharmaceutical agents through detection of multiple biological markers.  This will be accomplished under conditions of microgravity, within the weight, size and power requirements of space missions, and with minimal human intervention.  One representative biomarker of interest is 8-oxo-dG that serves as an indicator of oxidative DNA damage from radiation, chemicals, inflammation, and by-products of metabolism.  Upon repair of the damaged DNA, 8-oxo-dG is excreted into the urine where it may be conveniently monitored.  However, serious obstacles to detection and quantification arise due to the low amounts present and the complex chemical composition of urine.  Current techniques suffer from at least one of the following shortcomings: they are slow and labor-intensive, require complex instrumentation and a highly-trained operator, cannot be easily multiplexed to monitor many analytes, consume large amounts of reagents, and are not compatible for use under microgravity.  We will overcome these limitations by incorporating all analytical steps into a single microfluidic chip. Our system will utilize affinity purification and electrochemical detection.* [Multi-Agent Optical Sensor Chip for Cryogenic Fluids Leak Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8k9g-ra4n) - In space missions, launch vehicles (LV) are filled with cryogenic propellant fluids. It is important to protect these LVs from any leakage of liquid propellants through a reliable, accurate, leak detection system.  Currently used analytical methods do not meet space mission requirements of low power consumption, reliability, low weight, and cost effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to adapt, optimize, and integrate optical detection technologies into an accurate leak detection system for H2, O2, and CH4.
Due to their extreme low temperatures, these cryogenic fluids induce a contraction of the materials they contact, creating a potential cause of leakage. Hydrogen leakage in air creates an explosive atmosphere for hydrogen concentrations (between 4% (v/v) -- the lower explosive limit (LEL) and 74.5% (v/v) -- the upper explosive limit (UEL)) at room temperature and pressure. The early detection of cryogenic fluid leakage is extremely important for reasons of safety, reliability, and economy. IOS will provide its expertise in optical sensing to develop a miniaturized, reliable, highly sensitive, multi agent detection prototype, a Multi-Agent Optical Sensor Chip for Cryogenic Fluids Leak Detection (MOSCLD). The study will target detection limits of 1ppm or less and a response time in the millisecond range.* [Cathode Coupling Physics in a Hall Thruster](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7eei-ngy6) - As humankind seeks to reach Mars and beyond, advancement of electric propulsion (EP) will be a key factor in the pursuit of deep-space exploration. EP uses acceleration methods (electrostatic and electromagnetic), which do not rely on the conversion of heat to kinetic energy. Thus, EP achieves higher specific impulses than chemical propulsion through the acceleration of ionized particles. Among EP devices, magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters can provide the high-specific impulse, high-power propulsion required to enable ambitious exploration missions to Mars and beyond. Despite their potential advantages, MPD thrusters have not demonstrated efficiencies near theoretical predictions, which may be due to the 'anode fall' and 'onset' phenomena.

The proposed work is to investigate an MPD thruster with a suitable magnetic nozzle that can overcome the limitations imposed by anode fall and onset by controlling the field properties of the plasma in appropriate region of the nozzle and discharge chamber. Computational modeling provides a detailed understanding of the complex physical mechanisms. Improved magnetohydrodynamics models compared to experimental data will provide in-depth understanding of the limiting factors in the MPD thruster and useful insights for an optimal nozzle design. Finally, the proposed nozzle design will be tested numerically and experimentally.

The proposed work will improve the overall efficiency of the thruster, critically aid in the development and characterization of next generation MPD thrusters, and contribute to advancing EP for more distant and critical space missions in the future.* [ORSC Methane Ascent/Descent Engine Technology Development, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5uwq-83if) - Special Aerospace Services (SAS) is proposing a new and innovative ascent/descent engine using methane as its propellant. This engine will utilize the concepts of the Oxidizer Rich Staged Combustion (ORSC) cycle of the RD-8 to improve on performance over existing hardware. This SBIR program will leverage existing work SAS has done in conjunction with DARPA to on the RD-8 preburner to design and analyze a new engine with the benefits of the RD-8, but being able to use methane as the propellant. Additive manufacturing will be used to build the components of the engine to reduce cost and limitations in design.* [Development and Flight Testing of an Automated Upset Recovery System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jsgi-nmrk) - Loss of control (LOC) due to upset is one of the main causes of accidents in manned aircraft and is already emerging as a significant causal factor in unmanned aircraft accidents. On manned aircraft, recovery from an upset condition relies on the skill and training of an expert pilot. Due to reduced situational awareness and delays introduced by the command and control link, it is unlikely that a remote UAS operator will be able to serve this function. An advanced system capable of perception, cognition, and decision making is necessary to replace the need for an operator with upset recovery expertise and to mitigate the LOC risk on UAS. Barron Associates has recently developed a two-stage architecture that generates safe and effective recovery maneuvers for a large set of upset conditions including full stall and fully-developed spin modes.  The proposed research will design an upset detection system and integrate the system with the existing two-stage recovery architecture to yield a comprehensive autonomous upset recovery system. The decision about when to activate each stage of a recovery is difficult to make at design-time due to insufficient aerodynamic data and the inability to model all of the off-nominal precipitating factors that cause upsets. The proposed upset detection system does not rely on design-time characterization; instead, a rigorous statistical testing framework combines numerous pieces of information including vehicle attitude, rotational rate, and controller performance to answer the question: Has an upset occurred? Key Phase I goals include: upset detection algorithm development, integration of upset detection with existing recovery architecture, evaluation of system performance in simulation, and real-time hardware-in-the-loop demonstration using a commercially available autopilot.* [A Real-Time Fault Management Software System for Distributed Environments, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3diw-nx3e) - Fault Management (FM) is critical to mission operations and particularly so for complex instruments &#150; such as those used for aircraft and spacecraft. FM software and methodologies, however, too often have nagging limitations that restrict utility, and research and development continues to grapple relative to advancements in the complex systems they monitor. Modern spacecraft, for example, may have thousands of sensors and hundreds of systems/subsystems (and extensive cabling) but relatively few FM co-solutions. Theoretically, the overall FM challenge is in monitoring, modeling, and managing the huge numbers of signals and then determining how to detect them and set appropriate handling actions.

For complex systems FM is not trivial, and automated FM is tasked with catching potential failure conditions within interconnected networks before consequences elevate. Ensuring fault coverage while maintaining system reliability under these circumstances is a daunting challenge for even the most capable team, and from anecdotal evidence, it is apparent that FM remains partly elusive.

Our SBIR project herein involves the research and development of an innovative FM software solution called "DyMA-FM" (Dynamic Multivariate Assessment for Fault Management). As software, it uses model-based reasoning in a distributed processing environment for real-time detection and response to fault conditions.

Building on the Phase I successes, in the course of this Phase II we will further develop the DyMA-FM concept as an innovative full prototype FM software application, having a tiered hierarchical architecture design leveraging advances in mathematical modeling. Thus, as per the intent of the Phase II, we believe we have a well-defined and innovative FM system capable of meeting the NASA requirements and representative thematic goals of: (1) verifiability, (2) transparency, and (3) fault coverage. Phase II, then, will allow us to advance the development further and fully.* [Advanced Passive Liquid Feed PEM Electrolyzer, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e98h-pjcu) - Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers have undergone continuous development for the generation of oxygen and hydrogen for commercial, military and space applications since the 1970's.

Three approaches are combined to develop a system that will meet current and future NASA needs and exceed currently available power processor unit (PPU) performance in terms of electrical efficiency, specific mass (kg/kW), and cost.   The approaches include the use of (a) high-efficiency, 3-phase, dc-dc converters to minimize cooling requirements, mass, and parts count and maximize reliability and efficiency, (b) modularized and standardized sub-system design and fabrication techniques to accommodate power output scaling and re-configuration for specific ion thruster designs without the need to re-qualify hardware, and (c) attention to cost and manufacturability issues that will allow the implementation of electric propulsion systems on future NASA missions without the hidden costs of "hard-to-build" and "hard-to-scale" designs that are currently available.* [Bystander response to 2.5 Gy of protons in a human 3-dimensional skin model in 16 h after exposure](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gxbj-kxyh) - Bystander mechanisms that originate in the areas surrounding a tissue damage presumably play an important role participating in wound healing and tissue remodeling. Thus identification and characterization of bystander mechanisms will help to development of new treatments of patients with a radiation exposure. In the present study we irradiated 3-dimensional tissue model of human epidermis Epi-200 (Mat-Tek Ashland MA) with 2.5 Gy protons. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells located at 0.125-0.375 0.375-0.625 0.625-875 mm from the irradiation line. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH) and further gene ontology analysis and network analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems) and IPA (Ingenuity) accordingly. Significantly responding genes were identified at all distances and included sets common to both direct and bystander responses. False discovery rate in bystander samples did not exceed 20% (p=0.001) and was sufficiently low in the samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure (0.06-1.16%). Analysis of the fragments cut at the same distance revealed 52 54 and 88 differentially expressed genes. These gene lists overlapped each other had from 3 to 12 genes in common including CLED2 S100A7A. Samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure discovered 949 differentially expressed genes. Moreover the performed gene ontology analysis showed there overrepresentation of TP53 pathway (pathways p=2.04E-02) a common marker of direct irradiation response and also overrepresentation of the following groups of genes: signal transduction (p=4.52E-04) cell communication (p=1.24E-04) and cell cycle in the category of biological processes; DNA helicase activity (p=2.54E-07) receptor binding (p=6.19E-04) calcium ion binding proteins (p=2.57E-03) as the molecular functions. Differentially expresses genes of bystander samples had few categories in common such as cell communication (p=2.36E-03) and signal transduction (p=2.42E-03) among the biological processes and receptor activity (p=4.54E-03) among the molecular functions. Categories specific for the bystander samples included G-protein coupled receptors (p=7.24E-03) and ligand-gated ion channels (p=4.16E-03) suggesting a role of external stimulation and ion trafficking in bystander mechanisms. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model Epi-200 was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 2.5 Gy of protons. Four independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-375 375-625 and 625-875 micrometers) using three tissue fragments per a data point. Moreover three sets of whole tissue irradited samples were also generated for 0 and 2.5 Gy (6 samples total) and used for comparison of bystander and direct responses.* [Cryogenic MEMS Technology for Sensing Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6ftx-cz2v) - The development of cryogenic microwave components, such as focal plane polarization modulators, first requires an RF MEMS switching technology that operates effectively at cryogenic temperatures. The approach of this project is to explore the performance of capacitive MEMS switching technology at low temperatures. MEMS capacitive switches represent an alternative to ohmic contact switches, where the RF impedance of the device is not dependent on metal-metal contacts. These MEMS switches operate with much lower effective series resistance (generally ~ 0.25 ohms) and do not have the issues associated with dry contact switching. This technology also has the advantage of operating very well at millimeter-wave frequencies and higher, where many of the most demanding performance limitations exist. This technology has seen significant investment through DARPA and the DOD, and is directly applicable to high-performance microwave components needed in several of the upcoming NASA missions.* [CubeSat Autonomous Rendezvous & Docking Software (CARDS)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xg75-chj8) - This task creates spacecraft mission manager software to autonomously (i.e., without direct human operator intervention) maneuver a cubesat’s orientation and position relative to another vehicle in a proximity rendezvous and docking scenario from an initial distance of 1 km to a close in distance of 1 m. The algorithms are tailored for the unique resource and actuation limitations of a cubesat operating in low Earth orbit. The software will be demonstrated in real-time in the lab using an embedded microprocessor system that has cubesat flight heritage.* [Extreme Environment Hybrid Gearbox Technology, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pw4j-vc42) - Rocketstar Robotics proposes the development of a gearbox that uses all ball rolling contact for the highest loaded output gear reduction stage(s), is dry film lubricated and limits peak stresses to the well documented threshold limitation of dry film lubricants.  Extensive test data exists in the literature for the reliable application of dry film lubricants in ball bearing applications.  A gear reducer that utilizes ball bearing gear elements as the gear reducers highest loaded components will provide high specific torque and reliable, long life performance consistent with existing test data.* [Low Cost, Low Profile Steerable SATCOM Antenna, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ks55-sckx) - The small size of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms along with the need to reduce drag to increase flight time creates a need for low-profile antennas.  The oldest solution, a mechanically steered parabolic reflector, does not provide a low profile.  The modern electronically steered phased array is an alternative that does provide a low-profile antenna solution, but the cost of these antennas has prevented wider use.  Hybrid antenna solutions that are partly mechanically steered and partly electronically steered are an approach to maintain the low profile of a phase array at much lower cost.  Although existing hybrid solutions offer potential, there have been limitations in scan speed and Field-of-View (FOV).
FIRST RF has demonstrated the initial proof-of-concept capability of an innovative low-profile hybrid scan phased array antenna that reduces cost by nearly an order of magnitude relative to a conventional phased array for low profile applications and removes the limitations of previous designs in scanning and FOV.  This approach uses small mechanical actuators to reduce the parts count of the active components in the electronic steering portion of the aperture.  Unlike other hybrid scan solutions, which have asymmetrical fast and slow steering, this approach provides symmetrical fast electronic steering at angles near boresite with slower mechanical steering for large off-boresite angles.  The scan loss of this approach is actually lower than for fully electronic scanned phased array antennas, and the FOV is greater.  This technology is applicable for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) applications.* [Carbon Nanotube-Based Adsorbents for Ultrafine Particulate and Volatile Air Contaminants, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w5r6-qzgc) - While the protective qualities of activated carbon have been enhanced by the addition of specific metal salts, activated carbon technology has changed little over the last 60 years.  In this Phase I, Agave BioSystems and the Universities Space Research Association, propose to develop next generation smart adsorbents using novel carbon nanotube (CNT)-based structures for the adsorption and destruction of potentially toxic air contaminants.  Since CNTs have extremely high surface area, can be readily modified with metals or functional groups, and can function without the mass transfer limitations of traditional activated carbon, they are an ideal material for integration into spacecraft air handling systems.  Our goal is to build upon the unique structural and chemical nature of carbon nanotubes to generate a new generation of smart adsorbents.  The exceptionally high mass transfer properties of these in situ grown carbon nanotubes should reduce problems of current filters such as pore clogging or limited accessible material.* [Fast Neutron Dosimeter for the Space Environment, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v6ve-38zn) - Secondary neutrons make a significant contribution to the total absorbed dose received by space crews during long duration space missions However, only a limited number of measurements of the dose contribution from secondary neutrons have been made. In part this is due to an inability to easily discriminate between the fraction of dose which results from secondary neutrons and that which results from exposure to energetic charged particles. The energy of the secondary neutrons range from 1 to >100 MeV. Scintillation materials provide the optimum volume to payload performance, but their use has been limited by the need for PMTs.  A compact, lightweight, low-voltage, sensitive photodetector, such as CMOS SSPMs are an ideal candidate for this application.
In this work, we propose to develop a compact, lightweight, energy-efficient dosimeter for secondary neutrons from space radiation using state-of-the-art scintillation materials with a charged particle shield coupled to a high-gain, solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM), which is a high-density array of Geiger photodiodes, fabricated with CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology.  Such a dosimeter would overcome many of the limitations in the current generation of neutron dosimeters and meet the dosimetry needs for future human-space-exploration missions to the moon and Mars.* [Enabling Technologies for Fabrication of Large Area Flexible Antennas, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ip3d-udpb) - MesoScribe Technologies, a high tech start-up from SUNY-Stony Brook, proposes to apply a breakthrough new direct writing technology to meet the objectives set-forth in the NASA SBIR topic S2.06 Advanced Flexible Electronics.  This technology is based on revolutionary advances to modern day thermal spray materials processing enables deposition of wide range of electronic materials onto large areas at low processing temperatures and, for most part, requires no post-processing.  MesoScribe will develop large area patterning capability to demonstrate electronically steerable L-band, phased array antennas to meet NASA's goals.  During phase I the maximum dimensions for considerations will be ? x ? m.  This is based on the capabilities of our current motion system and not a limitation of the process itself.  The antennas will be designed, modeled, fabricated and characterized for performance attributes.  The flexibility of the system will also be assessed through appropriate bending experiments.  In parallel, conceptual strategies for large area fabrication will also discussed for future consideration.  Finally, MesoScribe will also demonstrate our unique ability in terms of direct fabrication of antenna elements on large space based objects that would provide a robust means for multi-functional integration of electromagnetics with space structures.* [High-Efficiency, Nanowire Based Thermoelectric Devices for Radioisotope Power Conversion, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/key7-m3th) - This SBIR Phase I proposal responds to topic S3.03 of the 2010 NASA SBIR solicitation, for Power Generation and Conversion.  Thermoelectric devices offer a simple and reliable means to convert radioisotope thermal energy into useable electrical power.  Previously, thermoelectric devices based on bulk semiconductor materials have been limited by low conversion efficiencies, with Figure of Merit (ZT) values around 1.0 or less.  Increasing ZT above 1.0 has thus far proved difficult, due to the fundamental limitation of identifying semiconductor materials with both a high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity.

This SBIR project will develop high efficiency thermoelectric devices based on nanowires.  The use of nanotechnology provides a means to circumvent previous limitations, and achieve combinations of properties not possible with bulk materials.  Phase I will demonstrate technical feasibility by producing high efficiency thermoelectric devices based on nanowires.  In Phase II, we will build and demonstrate prototype high efficiency thermoelectric devices.  Phase II will also develop low cost manufacturing technology for the nanowire based thermoelectric devices, and demonstrate a technology readiness level of TRL 6.* [C-Band SATCOM Range Communications System for ELVs using ESAs and High Dynamics Modem, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vpnw-x8bj) - Improving safety while increasing the pace of space launches requires improved communications capability. An increasing volume of real-time data from numerous sensors and systems can be transmitted to the ground if connecting links can be improved. One way to accomplish this is to use existing commercial satellites to supplement overburdened NASA communications systems. Used as an adjunct service, additional commercial capacity would act to increase launch safety, allowing an increased amount of data to be transponded to ground systems without detracting from the reliability of existing communication systems. Existing NASA links could continue to be used for mission critical requirements.
Limitations of two technologies prevent the transponding large amounts of data via commercial satellites. The first is a conformal antenna technology that can provide high gain by steering its beam toward the GEO satellite. The second is high-speed modem technology that can track a remote modem despite the wide dynamics experienced during launch and maneuvers. 
Paratek proposes to design a dual-beam, passive, electronically steered phased array (utilizing our proprietary Parascan?, phase shifters) and a highly dynamic modem to provide the communications link for spaced-based range applications. The system will leverage commercial Intelsat C-Band transponder network (4 GHz & 6 GHz).* [Aircraft Sensor-Logger with Power Replenishment Capabilities, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5kkg-b8v7) - Traditional instrumentation of an aircraft is a complex and time-consuming chore.  Once the sensors are installed, long wires for power and data must be routed through to a central data collection location where several large off-the-shelf electronic components reside, adding weight, cost and increasing the probably of introducing noise or faults into the testing system.  All of this necessary infrastructure leads to prohibit the use of some types of sensors and limit the total number of sensors used so save on time, cost, complexity and resources.  During the course of this Phase II SBIR research, Metis Design Corporation (MDC) proposes to develop a standardized data acquisition hub for aircraft testing sensors dubbed a "sensor-logger".  The sensor-logger would essentially serve as a durable sensor infrastructure node capable of autonomously facilitating local testing for multiple sensors of various types.  Controlled wirelessly by PC or PDA, data could be displayed in real-time, or logged internally for up to 40 hours.  The second half of the proposed research would then tie together the sensor-logger with the Phase I research, developing a power-replenishment device to attached to the sensor-logger to extend its operating capabilities.  Finally both devices will be flight tested in true aircraft environments.* [High Temperature "Smart" P3 Sensors and Electronics for Distributed Engine Control, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/win6-unhe) - Current engine control architectures impose limitations on the insertion of new control capabilities due to weight penalties and reliability issues related to complex wiring harnesses. NASA in collaboration with Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) has been conducting research in developing technologies to enable Distributed Engine Control (DEC) architectures. Realization of such future intelligent engines depends on the development of both hardware and software, including high temperature electronics and sensors to make smart components. NASA is particularly interested in the design and development of these applications for assessing the benefit they bring to the engine system. Compressor discharge pressure measurement has long been a key aspect of turbine engine control to manage stall margin. Given that, there is a need for a high-temperature, smart P3 sensor as a key building block for distributed engine controls. Given the current limitations of high temperature electronics, the business case for smart control elements (sensors and actuators) can be made in the fan/compressor section of the engine. The long-term objective of the proposed effort is to advance high-temperature P3 sensor technology for DEC applications through working with OEM partners and industry working groups to: (1) to iterate the current technology toward DEC formats/functions, (2) advance the digital electronics design/firmware and high temperature electronics, and (3) (through demonstration and stakeholder collaboration) present the viability (technical and business case) of the proposed sensor.* [MeshSLAM: Robust Localization and Large-Scale Mapping in Barren Terrain, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j8nz-fsd9) - Robots need to know their location to map of their surroundings but without global positioning data they need a map to identify their surroundings and estimate their location. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solves these dual problems at once. SLAM does not depend on any kind of infrastructure and is thus a promising localization technology for NASA planetary missions and for many terrestrial applications as well.

However, state-of-the-art SLAM depends on easily-recognizable landmarks in the robot's environment, which are lacking in barren planetary surfaces. Our work will develop a technology we call MeshSLAM, which constructs robust landmarks from associations of weak features extracted from terrain. Our test results will also show that MeshSLAM applies to all environments in which NASA's rovers could someday operate: dunes, rocky plains, overhangs, cliff faces, and underground structures such as lava tubes.

Another limitation of SLAM for planetary missions is its significant data-association problems. As a robot travels it must infer its motion from the sensor data it collects, which invariably suffers from drift due to random error. To correct drift, SLAM recognize when the robot has returned to a previously-visited place, which requires searching over a great deal of previously-sensed data. Computation on such a large amount of memory may be infeasible on space-relevant hardware. MeshSLAM eases these requirements. It employs topology-based map segmentation, which limits the scope of a search. Furthermore, a faster, multi-resolution search is performed over the topological graph of observations.

Mesh Robotics LLC and Carnegie Mellon University have formed a partnership to commercially develop MeshSLAM. MeshSLAM technology will be available via open source, to ease its adoption by NASA. In Phase 1 of our project we will show the feasibility of MeshSLAM for NASA and commercial applications through a series of focused technical demonstrations.* [SAFARI 2000 Surface Irradiance Measurements, Mongu Tower Site, Zambia, 2000-2002](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fprh-8tw3) - This data set contains the top-of-canopy irradiance in the shortwave (0.3-2.8 micron) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 0.4-0.7 micron) wavebands collected with an Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometer (PSP) and a Skye SKE510 pyranometer, respectively. The instruments were deployed at the top of the 30-m tower in the Kataba Local Forest approximately 20 km south of Mongu in Western Province, Zambia. The data include the hourly mean and maximum values from 0500-1600 GMT (7 a.m. - 6 p.m. local time) and cover the period from September 4, 2000 to December 31, 2002. The data were obtained primarily for EOS validation and energy budget modeling.The Skye SKE510 uses a blue enhanced planar diffused silicon detector and has a fairly even response from 400 to 700 nm. The Eppley PSP is a World Meteorological Organization First Class Radiometer designed for the measurement of sun and sky radiation, totally or in defined broad wavelength bands. It comprises a circular multi-junction wire-wound thermopile. A data logger sampled the sensors at 60-second intervals and recorded the maximum and mean values every 60 minutes throughout the day.The data are contained within a single ASCII text file, in comma-separated-value format, with associated date, time, and QA information.* [NACP Site: Terrestrial Biosphere Model and Aggregated Flux Data in Standard Format](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pu3p-kkgt) - This data set provides standardized output variables for gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), leaf area index (LAI), ecosystem respiration (Re), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H) from 24 terrestrial biosphere models for 47 eddy covariance flux tower sites in North America. Each model used standardized input data for each flux tower site (i.e., gap-filled, locally observed weather; land use history; and other site specific data) and followed standard model setup and spinup procedures. The files also contain gap-filled observations and total uncertainty estimates. The data set was compiled for the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Synthesis for use in model inter-comparison and assessment of how well the models simulate carbon processes across vegetation types and environmental conditions in North America. There is one compressed (.zip) file with this data set. When expanded, the .zip file contains model output data for one variable at one site. The model output and observations are available at the native half-hourly time step, or in daily, monthly, and annual aggregations, in comma-separated text (.csv) format.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Monthly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kmxu-st3e) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

	The MERRA-Land product, MSTMNXMLD or tavgM_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional monthly mean at the native resolution. All collections from this group are at reduced horizontal resolution. 
	
    The data are on the GEOS-5 native 540 x 361 grid with 2/3&deg; longitude x 1/2&deg; latitude resolution. Data are archived in the HDF-EOS (Grid) format, based on HDF4.* [Passive Radiation Shielding: Integrating Multilayer and Multipurpose Materials into Space Habitat Design](https://data.nasa.gov/d/h4ph-uauf) - The prospect of long-term human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit poses a unique set of challenges for space habitat designers. One of those challenges is protecting astronauts from the ionizing radiation in space. On Earth, people are largely protected from that radiation by the atmosphere and the magnetic field. But beyond the natural protection mechanisms of the Earth, the space radiation environment can be dangerous for astronauts. It puts them at risk of several severe health problems, including cancer, central nervous system damage, and cataracts.

Although there are several sources of ionizing radiation in space, one of the greatest causes for concern are galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). GCRs are isotropic and low in flux. They are a source of chronic radiation exposure, putting astronaut health at risk gradually over time. GCRs are mostly composed of protons and helium nuclei, but the largest concern for human health comes from their minority heavy ion component. The heavy ions in GCRs can potentially penetrate shielding and human tissue. In the interest of enabling a long-term lunar or Martian mission, the radiation protection systems should be improved to better protect against GCRs.

One radiation protection method is passive shielding. A passive radiation shield is a material that is placed between a radiation source and a radiosensitive target, designed to absorb the radiation before it reaches the target. A simple example is a patient wearing a lead apron over his or her vital organs, while being exposed to X-rays at a hospital. In space, passive radiation shielding is more complicated than it sounds, because the variations in particle composition and energy spectra make it difficult to develop a catchall shield. For long-term, human-rated missions, the best material choices for passive radiation shielding tend to be multipurpose, hydrogen-rich, and have a small atomic mass.

The purpose of this research is to investigate innovative passive shielding methodologies that are integrated into the design of space habitats. Specifically, this research will evaluate the feasibility of using multilayer materials, water walls, and varied habitat configurations in order to help keep astronaut radiation exposure as low as reasonably achievable. The goal is to improve the shielding efficacy against GCRs, while reducing the amount of parasitic mass required to protect the astronauts. NASA's On-Line Tool for the Assessment of Radiation in Space (OLTARIS) will be used to perform the analyses. This research directly serves to advance the fidelity of topic 6.5.3.2 in the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap, and ultimately, it aims to advance our ability to explore our solar system.* [TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) Level 1 Raw and Calibrated Radiance Products (TRMM Product 1A11) V6](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pyis-ghjb) - The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint U.S.-Japan satellite mission to monitor tropical and subtropical precipitation and to estimate its associated latent heating. TRMM was successfully launched on November 27, at 4:27 PM (EST) from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan.

The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is a nine-channel passive microwave radiometer, which builds on the heritage of the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument flown aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. Microwave radiation is emitted by the Earth&apos;s surface and by water droplets within clouds. However, when layers of large ice particles are present in upper cloud regions - a condition highly correlated with heavy rainfall - microwave radiation tends to scatter at frequencies above 19 GHz. The TMI detects radiation at five frequencies chosen to discriminate among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood of rainfall. The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by this method is the deduction of cloud precipitation consistent with the radiation measurement at each frequency. The TMI frequencies are 10.65, 19.35, 37 and 85.5 GHz (dual polarization), and 21 GHz (vertical polarization only).

The Level 1A product file (1A11) is a concatenation of the Level 0 data with a header record and, as such, is reversible to Level 0. The header record contains information pertaining to orbit times, orbit number, times of the first scan and number of scans, among other things. The Level 0 data contain the actual channel data expressed as &quot;sensor counts.&quot; A file contains data for a single orbit with a file size of about 7 MB (uncompressed).  There are 16 files of TMI 1A11 data produced per day.

Spatial coverage is between 38 degrees North and 38 degrees South owing to the 35 degree inclination of the TRMM satellite. This orbit provides extensive coverage in the tropics and allows each location to be covered at a different local time each day, enabling the analysis of the diurnal cycle of precipitation.

The sensors developed here are based on the GaN/AlGaN materials system and are sensitive in the wavelength range from 250-400nm. Target responsivities are > 0.1 A/W throughout the spectral interest range. The first arrays produced under phase 1 were sensitive both to 285 and 315 nm simultaneously. Multicolor sensitivity improves background noise rejection and provides much more detailed analysis of atmospheric aerosol scattering. Noise is dominated by diode reverse leakage and is less than 10-9A/cm2. The CE manufacturing process is enabled by the recognition that surfaces on which radiation sensitive materials are grown cannot be exposed to plasma etch effluents. To overcome this limitation, a dielectric lift-off-lithography process was developed. In this process, the growth surfaces only come in contact with organic solvents and photosensitive plastics during manufacture. Initial results were obtained on a 10 x 10 diode array. In subsequent work, we intend to produce 100 x 100 arrays. In addition, it the range of attainable spectral sensitivities will be mapped out by studying the range of achievable AlGaN stoichiometries that are practically attainable.* [ABoVE: Study Domain and Standard Reference Grids](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f6tz-pwbn) - The Arctic - Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) has developed two standardized spatial data products to expedite coordination of research activities and to facilitate data interoperability. First, the ABoVE Study Domain encompasses the Arctic and boreal regions of Alaska, USA, and the western provinces of Canada, North America. Core and Extended study regions have been designated within this Domain and are provided in both a vector representation (Shapefile) and a raster representation (GeoTIFF at 1,000-meter pixel resolution). Second, a Standard Reference Grid System has been developed to cover the entire Study Domain and also extends to the eastern portion of North America. This Reference Grid is provided as a nested pair of polygon grids at scales of 240- and 30-meter spatial resolution. A shapefile is provided for each grid. Note that the designated standard projection for the all ABoVE products is the Canadian Albers Equal Area projection.* [A Novel Microfluidic Device for Fully Automated Extraction of RNA from Cell Cultures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/b7c4-8a85) - Differential gene expression by RNA profiling is a universal and critical step in space biology experiments, which seek to link specific molecular events with disease phenotypes. Current RNA preparation methods are tedious, require substantial astronaut time, and necessitate exposure to toxic chemicals. They often have poor, unreliable yields due to RNase contamination. Our overall objective is to develop and commercialize a microfluidics based miniaturized platform (MED-RNA) that can fully automate the complex process of RNA extraction. Starting from harvested whole mammalian cells in a culture medium, MED-RNA will lyse, capture, extract/isolate and freeze/store RNA content for later analysis, in a fully integrated fashion with minimal user intervention. In addition to higher yields and faster process times, losses and contamination will be minimized as a result of the miniaturization and automation. A novel and unique plastic card based fabrication technology from Micronics Corp. will be leveraged for low-cost microfabrication. In Phase I, we will develop detailed design for the microfluidic lab card and the integrated system. We will also fabricate and demonstrate critical components (lysis and capture) of MED-RNA. The design process will be based on the state-of-the-art, multiphysics biochip design software from CFDRC. In Phase II, a fully integrated microfluidic lab card (including storage) will be developed and demonstrated on chosen cell lines.* [Adaptive Digital Pre-distorter for Higher-Order Modulation Nonlinearities and Data Jitter](https://data.nasa.gov/d/drg8-84gw) - <p>Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the adoption of variable coding &amp; modulation (VCM); and adaptive coding &amp; modulation (ACM) for the communication systems of near-Earth satellites.&nbsp; These spectral efficient techniques increase data rates by utilizing the available link margins and pairing various channel coding schemes with higher-order modulations, but have a number of implementation and performance challenges.&nbsp; We propose to develop an adaptive digital pre-distorter modulator that would overcome these challenges.&nbsp; Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the adoption of variable coding &amp; modulation (VCM); and adaptive coding &amp; modulation (ACM) for the communication systems of near-Earth satellites.&nbsp; These spectral efficient techniques increase data rates by utilizing the available link margins and pairing various channel coding schemes with higher-order modulations, but have a number of implementation and performance challenges.&nbsp; We propose to develop an adaptive digital pre-distorter that would overcome these challenges.</p><p>The Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has adopted two VCM/ACM systems, Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB-S2) and Serially Concatenated Convolutional Coding (SCCC), but the fundamental concept of VCM/ACM can be applied to existing sets of CCSDS protocols, such as Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes with higher order modulations.&nbsp; These systems try to operate with all available link margins while maintaining a constrained bandwidth, by increasing data rates through the use of various channel coding and modulation combinations.</p><p>Fundamentally, higher-order modulations are heavily sensitive to channel distortions, producing large losses in link performance and power efficiency.&nbsp; The distortions are typically handled by pre-distortion of the waveforms prior to the amplifier, with one of the most practical approaches being the application of a static inversion of the measured amplifier characteristics.&nbsp; However, these pre-distortion approaches have limited capability due in part to improper characterization of the amplifier response or the limitation in the pre-distortion algorithm.&nbsp; Typically, manufacturers&rsquo; input amplitude modulation to output amplitude modulation (AM/AM) and input amplitude modulation to output phase modulation (AM/PM) curves are measured with a single tone radio frequency carrier that is varied in power.&nbsp; However, the data modulated transmitted signal is dynamic, with a spectrum of side tones across the bandwidth.&nbsp; The non-linearity will produce intermodulation products that are not considered in these measurements, thus designing a pre-distorter with these measurements is inaccurate and will produce a large penalty in the error performance of the link.</p><p>Alternatively, the input drive level of the amplifier can be backed off to minimize nonlinearities.&nbsp; However, as the order of the modulation increases, so does the amount of backed off power.&nbsp; Having a transmitter operating with a large amount of required input back off translates into a tremendous amount of direct current (DC) power required on the spacecraft to support these modulations.</p><p>The objective of this proposal is to develop an adaptive digital pre-distorter that can overcome the challenge of requiring excessively high DC power for higher-order modulations that are required for high-data rates links, e.g. VCM/ACM links.&nbsp; In addition, the fundamental approach can also be applied to mitigate phase noise by reducing symbol-to-symbol jitter.&nbsp; The advantages of digital pre-distortion are that the dynamic and memory behavior of the AM/AM can be measured in real-time while the adaptive algorithm can mitigate these effects to a designed precision based on a learning algorithm.&nbsp; Therefore we can effectively eliminate any distortions created by the amplifier.</p>* [CubeSat Storage and Communications Card](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wnwh-q539) - <p>Science and housekeeping data generated on a CubeSat can be collected for hours or days between opportunities to downlink, but each downlink window provides only a few minutes of time to transfer this data to the ground.&nbsp; Most transceivers which handle this task provide little buffering of this data, and when the C&amp;DH processor has a slower serial link it limits the effective downlink rate of the transceiver.&nbsp; An integrated onboard mass storage and transceiver interface card would mitigate this limitation and allow downlink rates at the maximum rate of the transceiver while allowing the C&amp;DH to forward downlink data over a slower serial interface.</p>* [International Ice Patrol (IIP) Iceberg Sightings Database, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mdgd-fz8j) - The International Ice Patrol (IIP) has been collecting information on iceberg activity in the North Atlantic since 1913. This database contains the data from these sightings from 1960 through most current processing. The IIP data files include latitude and longitude of sighted icebergs, coded iceberg size and shape class, and date and time of the sighting. The IIP area of responsibility is 40° N to 65° N and 39° W to 57° W. Note, the IIP area of responsibility prior to 2006 was 40° N to 52° N and 39° W to 57° W.

Current instruments for such in-situ analysis, however, require that geological samples be brought to the surface by a sample acquisition tool and subsequently processed and presented to the analyzer. This model has significant limitations with regard to science yield: evaporation of volatile molecules before reaching the instrument, loss of stratigraphic information, sample bias, and cross-contamination. Furthermore, sophisticated sample acquisition, processing and handling mechanisms required to operate in uncontrolled, dusty environments are expensive and failure-prone.

We therefore propose an alternative: bring the instrument to the sample. Specifically, we propose development of a fiber-coupled laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) system, integrated into a 3m-class drill. LIBS uses a high-energy laser pulse to create a plasma on the surface of the material under test; the atomic emissions are collected by a spectrometer and yield elemental composition and basic molecular information. DIHeDRAL will allow profiling of an entire borehole wall, centimeter by centimeter, 360 degrees, from the top to the bottom. 

The proposed Phase II work will include development of a functional prototype and its integration in a drill string and test to a depth of 1m. The performance of the sensor will be tested in a chamber capable of closely reproducing the conditions of the Lunar surface.* [Dropsonde System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/d4vm-b4vi) - A small, modular dropsonde launcher is being developed for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  Some critical measurement needs can only be satisfied by in-situ measurements.  Key examples of such measurements include detailed atmospheric profiles, point meteorological conditions on the surface, and in-situ measurements for calibration and validation of remote sensing systems.  
	Phase I work saw the design and fabrication of a new type of dropsonde with a novel form factor and the associated launcher.  The system was installed in a representative UAV nose.  System components were successfully tested.
	Phase II will involve finalizing the launcher and dropsonde designs, developing the associated control and data handling system, building and testing the integrated system, and finally conducting test flights on a UAV.  
	The ultimate result of the project will be a dropsonde system that can be fitted to many NASA UAVs, including small UAVs, and enable them to gather in-situ atmospheric profiles and surface measurements using dropsondes.
	The Phase II entry TRL is 5; the expected exit TRL is 8.* [Protein Colloidal Aggregation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vvud-s2w8) - <p>Finding an optimal treatment for any disease is impossible until we fully understand its cause. We believe the central problem in obtaining this understanding is that the most commonly proposed models for amyloid aggregation may be incorrect, and that the process is not fundamentally biological. We plan to investigate the pathways and kinetics of protein aggregation to allow accurate predictive modeling of the process and evaluation of potential inhibitors to prevalent diseases including cataract formation, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and others.<p/><p>The goal of the Protein Colloidal Aggregation project is to understand the underlying cause of several major diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. These diseases all occur when protein molecules undergo a peculiar and irreversible process in which they aggregate to form tiny fibers of a unique material called amyloid, which the body cannot remove. Despite enormous investment in research, the fundamental physiochemical mechanism of these diseases remains poorly understood.  Based on initial studies using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we theorized that the aggregation of proteins in these diseases is driven instead by colloidal interactions, the same forces that govern the behavior of nanoscale particles in the colloidal suspensions we encounter every day, such as paint, milk, and clouds. Our theory is being validated by the evidence. For many years, NASA has been heavily involved in research into the structure of proteins and their assembly into crystals, and in studying the colloidal interactions and aggregation of nanoscale particles. To date, however, NASA's colloid research has involved only nonbiological materials. But now we are bridging these two fields by studying the colloidal aggregation of proteins.</p>* [Modular, Plug and Play, Distributed Avionics, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g7bv-t7h6) - The objective of this SBIR effort  was to prove the viability of an Ethernet version of the  MicroSat Systems, Inc. (MSI) modular, plug and play (PnP) spacecraft avionics architecture. This revolutionary architecture provides a near-term solution to modular, plug and play avionics while distributing power and data management functions on a single circuit allowing rapid interfacing to other satellite avionics such as the GSFC Space Cube.  By integrating the MSI protocol converter technology with the ABET Technologies Digital Current System, MSI can provide a network with standardized attachment nodes that carries data and power on an Intelligent Power/Data Ring (IPDR).The IPDR network, which can host a variety of data protocols, currently implements a high speed SPA-S (SpaceWire) core to support the AFRL PnP efforts. It enables full PnP modularity reducing spacecraft integration and test to a few days.  Since the system is implemented with a common set of nodes for every interface instead of custom cards in a card cage, the hardware costs are dramatically lower as well, only 40-60% of comparable centralized systems. Using commercial Ethernet parts integrated into the existing IPDR node processor and interface boards successful proof of concept testing was performed during Phase I.  The transfer of Ethernet data frames was demonstrated into the IPDR ring via a peripheral Ethernet device, from one IPDR node to another, and finally back out of the ring to the external Ethernet device. Figure 1 shows the setup of the final node-to-node Ethernet communication test. Although this testing verified the fundamental functionality of Ethernet communication on the IPDR ring avionics, there is significant effort remaining to mature this into a flight worthy avionics architecture .  The Phase II will investigate flight parts selection for the nodes, firmware development required to improve bandwidth, and flight qualification and delivery of a Ethernet version of an IPDR node.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Diurnal (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c32b-nwj8) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present.

The M-MED is gravity independent and provides both the high force resistance and low force rowing type resistance. To date the results indicate that foot forces in resistance mode exercise on M-MED are similar to those seen using free weight exercises.     
Electromyography (EMG) studies demonstrate that similar activation levels are seem in key muscles during either M-MED based or free weight resistance exercise. EMG during rowing demonstrate that the thigh, leg, and arm muscles are robustly activated. Endurance mode exercise was also found to stimulate recruitment of the muscles which support the spine. In a recently completed study, 32 subjects (16 male, 16 female) completed 5 weeks of combined resistance and endurance training using the M-MED. Muscle strength increased ~20% while aerobic fitness measured as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) increased ~8%. M-MED training increased time to hand grip fatigue by ~70% and leg extension fatigue by ~27%. Thigh muscle cross sectional area increased ~11% as a result of training. Additional deliverables include cross validation of VO2max testing results between the M-MED device and laboratory standard cycle ergometry based testing protocols. As requested by NASA, additional studies have demonstrated that M-MED based exercise can increase the size and strength of the calf and hamstrings muscle groups. These results demonstrate that the M-MED device can be used for both training and physical work capacity testing providing a platform for in-flight assessment.     
In summary, findings to date indicate that the gravity independent M-MED is a viable option for resistance- and endurance-mode exercise during flight and/or planetary exploration thereby addressing two critical risks: 1) Cardiovascular deconditioning; 2) Decreased muscle strength, endurance, and size (atrophy). Endurance mode exercise may have the added benefit of maintaining and, possibly, improving endurance of arm muscles of flight crews as well as aiding in the maintenance of lower back stability and loading during flight and planetary exploration.

This minimum 8-in. diagonal drop-down head-up display with no moving parts will present six or more perspective views to air crew members, forming integrated virtual volumetric 3D images viewable over a 60 degree horizontal field of view.  In Phase I POC designed a laboratory prototype and successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed system by assembling a single-user monochrome 3D-COD prototype.  In Phase II POC will further develop the true 3D display technology and construct a fully functional system that will project distortion-free, 400-600 lumen, full-color, virtual volumetric 3D images at a 30-60 Hz video rate for real-time user interaction with the images, each from his or her own perspective.* [Global Cyclone Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f2cj-m2e5) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI) Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation (WASP). Utilizing average monthly precipitation data from 1980 through 2000 at a resolution of 2.5 degrees, WASP assesses the precipitation deficit or surplus over a three month temporal window that is weighted by the magnitude of the seasonal cyclic variation in precipitation. The three months' averages are derived from the precipitation data and the median rainfall for the 21 year period is calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells where the three month running average of precipitation is less than 1 mm per day ae excluded. Drought events are identified when the magnitude of a monthly precipitation deficit is less than or equal to 50 percent of its longterm median value for three or more consecutive months. Grid cells are then divided into 10 classes having an approximately equal number of grid cells. Higher grid cell values denote higher frequencies of drought occurrences. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Electrical Impedance Tomography Technology](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vpps-9q2h) - <p>The goal for the&nbsp;Electrical Impedance Tomography Technology (EITT) project is to develop a reliable portable, lightweight device providing two-dimensional tomographic imaging of the human body using impedance mapping. This technology could be developed to evaluate health risks and provide appropriate medical care on the International Space Station&nbsp;(ISS), during space travel and on the ground.</p> <p>Electrical Impendance Tomography (EIT) utilizes a series of electrodes in a circumferential band-like device feeding these signals to a portable computer that generates images similar to a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan using a mathematical algorithm.The development and validatation of this new technoligy could provide reliable portable imaging of the head and chest cavity through the use of EIT. Impedance has been used to gain knowledge of cardiac function for several decades but not used as a scanning technique.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Still early in development, Electrical Impedance Tomography Technology (EITT) is designed to provide images allowing doctors to monitor a patient&#39;s airflow or blood flow. While tools such as X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are well known, they don&#39;t work well in a space environment due to radiation, user training, size and power usage considerations. These same limitations exist in remote locations on Earth.</p><p>The EITT device is a belt of electrodes worn around the portion of the body to be imaged. Once placed on a patient, it sends its observations to a computer, which then converts that signal to a still image or even a stream of live data. This information can be sent from space to the ground, or from remote locations anywhere in the world.</p>* [NACP Regional: National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Aggregated Gridded Model Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kasf-cwbw) - This data set provides two products that were derived from the recently published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis 1-degree terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs (Gridded 1-deg Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et al., 2013). The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional Synthesis - Description of Observations and Models.* [NACP Regional: Original Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8cxg-662q) - ABSTRACT: This data set contains the originally-submitted observation measurement data, terrestrial biosphere model output data, and inverse model simulations that various investigator teams contributed to the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis activities. The data set provides nine (9) data packages of remote sensing and ground observation measurements (OM) (MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP), MODIS net primary production (NPP), MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPar), MODIS leaf area index (LAI), MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), MODIS normalize difference vegetation index (NDVI), Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) forest biomass, National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) crop NPP, and Flux Anomaly). The data set also provides data packages of simulation results from 19 terrestrial biosphere models (TBM) and eight (8) inverse models (IM). The data packages are respectively OM, TBM, and IM data files listed in Tables 4-6. Each OM, TBM, and IM data package contains all of the original data (and documentation, if any) that the NACP Modeling and Synthesis Thematic Data Center (MAST-DC) acquired or received. These originally-submitted data were processed by the MAST-DC to produce the three standardized gridded data sets of carbon flux for inter-comparison purposes (see Related Data Products below). These original data and documentation are provided to allow users of the standardized gridded data products to be able to trace back to the data origins when needed. The Data Center (ORNL DAAC) transformed some of the originally-submitted data files to file formats that are more suitable for long-term archiving. For example, *.xlsx files were saved as *.csv, ERDAS Imagine files were converted to GeoTIFFs, and MATLAB files were converted to GeoTIFF and NetCDF formats as appropriate. Files received in NetCDF, GeoTIFF, and HDF formats were not transformed.* [Core Flight Software for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tknr-s8n2) - Use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) is increasing worldwide, but multiple technical barriers restrict the greater use of UASs. The safe operation of UASs in the National Airspace (NAS) will require the vehicle to equipped with sophisticated avionics and flight software. The cost of verifying the flight software required for safe operation is a tremendous barrier to the growth of the technology. Windhover Labs intends to port NASAs Core Flight Software (CFS) to a UAS platform, and use new techniques and tools to lower flight software verification costs. This will provide a safe platform for UAS technology expansion. Windhover Labs intends to extend the existing safety critical pedigree of CFS to UASs. We will develop all the UAS platform specific applications and integrate them into a UAS avionics package. Windhover Labs will certify the CFS framework so application developers need only focus on the verification of their applications. With the basic UAS platform certification taken care of, UAS users can focus on their specific needs like precision agriculture, aerial survey, product delivery, etc. CFS is built around a software bus which allows for straightforward addition of this application specific software. Windhover Labs will also create an embedded test agent. This agent will provide an automated test engine that has access to all the application interfaces. This embedded agent provides an interface and execution platform for application developers to write effective verification tests. Innovative ground control software will enable automating the execution of these tests and the collecting of necessary verification evidence. The CFS framework is a perfect fit for powering the future of UASs in the NAS. Windhover Labs believes that providing this safety critical flight software framework and verification tools tailored for that framework lowers the technology barrier so many new UAS applications can be brought to market affordably.* [Metabolic Cost Approach to Characterizing Advanced Spacesuit Mobility](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nyty-4st7) - <p>Spacesuit mobility has been historically difficult to define and therefore, difficult to write requirements for.  Most previous efforts have concentrated on establishing metrics for isolated joints – often multiple movements for each joint – and characterizing the range of motion of that joint – as well as the corresponding joint torque through said range of motion.  However, there have been multiple issues with this approach:  First, it has been shown through multiple tests at JSC that joint torque data lacks repeatability, even with the same test setup and subject; Second, a suit can often meet defined mobility requirements yet exhibit lackluster or anomalous mobility behavior (or vice versa); Third, defining mobility at the isolated joint level does not capture the mobility of the comprehensive suit system in real application, with multiple joints often working in harmony or in discord.  Lastly, there lacks a standardized testing protocol with which JSC and suit contractors can assess suited mobility in a repeatable and predictable manner.  The proposal contained herein aims to mitigate all of these problems through investigating a new method of suited mobility characterization: by measuring the relative metabolic cost associated with performing a series of functional tasks as compared to performing those same tasks in a shirtsleeve environment.</p>* [A Radiation Nose for monitoring radiation in space missions](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ba2d-vahp) - <p>This project developed a radiation monitoring system using conventional silicon CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) chip except by replacing the silicon dioxide dielectric with a liquid dielectric.<p/><p> Radiation detectors should be capable of discriminating various radiation sources at room temperature with a good energy resolution and amenable to different platforms such as handheld, benchtop, and portals for ports and airports. Current technologies including 3He detectors, scintillators, and solid-state detectors are bulky and expensive.  We developed a new radiation detection method and architecture. Some liquids react to radiation exposure with a change in molecular structure, leading to a change in properties such as dielectric constant and polarization. Inspired by such responsivity of liquids, we  constructed a transistor with a radiation-responsive liquid as a gate dielectric replacing the conventional oxide gate layer. The current voltage characteristics of the liquid gate dielectric transistor  change upon exposure to any type of radiation. Different types of liquids that specifically interact with various target radiations can be used in an array of transistors serving as a radiation nose to discriminate different radiation sources. Moreover, the fluidity of the liquid facilitates the exchange of the damaged liquid with fresh liquid after some time, allowing a reusable sensor. Selection of liquid-state gate dielectric is important for an acceptable device performance, and the choice should satisfy the following requirements: insulating properties, proper dielectric constant, dielectric strength, thermal stability, high purity, low moisture absorption, low viscosity, and responsive to radiation. Preliminary results from this project include detection of gamma radiation.  Future work would include development of a radiation nose capable of detecting multiple types of radiation with energy discrimination.</p>* [Paper-based Biosensor for Rapid Colorimetric Detection of Pathogenic Bacteria](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gc4j-v5av) - <p>The current project proposes to develop a real-time method for identification of targeted microorganisms using a paper-based biosensor system with ease-of-use, minimal requirement of time, and a simple interpretation of results imparted by colorimetric indication. To prove the feasibility of this approach, a binding target (ligand), specific for the bacterial pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, will be attached to gold nanoparticle carriers (nanoconjugate), that are supported on a paper strip. Upon interaction with the bacteria, the nanoconjugates will aggregate, resulting in a color change on the paper.  Due to the high sensitivity and specificity of the ligand, only the presence of S. aureus in a sample will result in a color change.<p/><p>The ability to monitor microbial contamination remains a critical technique in the mitigation of risk to crew health and vehicle systems during human spaceflight missions. Current methods of bacterial and fungal monitoring on the International Space Station (ISS) depend on culturing of microorganisms during spaceflight and subsequent ground-based identification. This approach requires substantial crew time, uses consumables with short shelf lives, and prevents a rapid response to microbial contamination. To address these limitations for future missions beyond low-Earth orbit, a biosensor using gold nanoparticles is being developed for the rapid detection of medically significant microorganisms. For proof-of-concept, we have targeted the detection of Staphylococcus aureus, a common infectious agent that has been repeatedly isolated aboard the ISS. Gold nanoparticles were modified by the covalent attachment of an antibody that has a high binding affinity for a protein on the cell wall of S. aureus. Upon interaction with a sample containing S. aureus, binding between the nanoparticles and the bacteria occurred rapidly. A significant reduction in the red coloration of the colloidal nanoparticle suspension, and the formation of a large purple pellet was observed following a brief centrifugation step. Comparison of the absorbance spectra verified the visual observation, demonstrating that there was a significant reduction in the absorbance of the supernatants of reaction samples in which S. aureus was present. This biosensing system provides a rapid means to specifically detect only the targeted organism. Further development will potentially lead to a small, lightweight biosensor that can be easily adapted to detect other selected microorganisms in real-time, providing crews of future spaceflight missions a simple method to autonomously define potential infectious disease risks.</p>* [Generic FMS Platform for Evaluation of Autonomous Trajectory-Based Operation Concepts, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/acjj-nneh) - The objective of the Phase II work is to develop a generic, advanced Flight Management System (FMS) for the evaluation of autonomous 4D-trajectory based operations (4DTBO) concepts. The work will address the following limitations of most commercially available FMS: they have limited advanced features; are specific to a single aircraft type; and cannot be readily modified by researchers. The proposed research will identify and extend advanced FMS features for the simulation evaluation of 4DTBO concepts in different phases of flight, based on the feasibility demonstration during Phase I work. Some of proposed feature include (i) advanced 4D guidance modes such as Required Time of Arrival (RTA), 4DFMS, and Interval Management (IM), (ii) high-fidelity wind modeling and wind update capability for improved predictability, (iii) trajectory negotiation, (iv) optimal 4D trajectory planning. Phase II work will develop a generic FMS interface to NASA's Multi-Aircraft Control System (MACS) to enable the evaluation of FMS modules from multiple vendors in 4DTBO simulations. The proposed FMS platform and the generic FMS interface will allow the users to deploy a wide array of autonomy enabling FMS features through a Graphical User Interface. All the algorithms and software developed under this research will be delivered to NASA at the end of the project.* [mREST: Flexible Open Interface Standard for Test and Launch Operations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nrbw-7eb9) - Spaceflight systems must pass through a complex set of testing and processing before being cleared for launch.  A significant portion of the pre-launch processing involves integration with other flight systems, general ground support equipment, and test equipment.  The process of interfacing this equipment has historically been a source of numerous delays and unplanned work prior to launch.  The proliferation of different interface types, designs, and manufacturers only serves to increase the difficulties associated with pre-launch integration and testing.The development and adoption of improved, standardized interfaces holds the potential of reducing the cost and complexity of the testing and launch processing processes and could provide eventual benefits to autonomous servicing in future space missions.  In-space and surface servicing of multiple types of spacecraft becomes more feasible if a common interface approach can be developed and widely adopted.

In 2012, METECS developed the mREST Architecture and Interface Specification  and began developing software prototypes that could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the standard for the automation of testing in flight laboratories at the NASA/Johnson Space Center.  This specification and the associated software became collectively known simply as "mREST".

The proposed innovation is to expand on the mREST foundational work to design an interface standard that can be utilized to solve the issues associated with test and launch operations.  This will be accomplished by first doing research into the specific issues that typically arise during the pre-launch process and identifying areas where the existing mREST specification should be expanded and/or refined.* [Microwave Detection of Laser Ultrasonic for Non-Destructive Testing, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/psyd-zfz3) - In this proposal, we describe a program to develop a high-performance, cost-effective and robust microwave receiver prototype for multi-purpose Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE). Currently, NDE of space transportation vehicles is primarily carried out on the ground, between missions.  For future space missions, as duration and frequency increases, more inspection will need to be performed in space in order to monitor the aging process of the structure and to insure its integrity. For this purpose, NDE equipment that is compact, lightweight, easily operated by human with limited mobility or robot, and that exhibits low power consumption is required. Furthermore, in order to minimize the quantity of embarked equipment, the inspection equipment must be able to perform as many different inspection tasks as possible. Our innovative receiver is based on the integration of a microwave interferometer coupled with a pulsed laser to generate the ultrasound. . Based on the results obtained during Phase 1, we strongly think that we will be able to overcome the limitation generally associated with classical optical receiver: 1) Inability to work in factory environment where thermal, mechanical and optical propagation (fumes, water drops,..) perturbations are present; 2) Reduction in sensitivity caused by the speckle nature of the light reflected from rough surfaces; 3) High system cost due the price of the probe lasers, optics and engineering to develop an optical system working in a harsh environment (fumes, water drops, strong mechanical vibration) and 4) high maintenance cost (Lasers and optics need to be checked and re-aligned frequently). Our proposed approach will lead to a cost-effective prototype with good sensitivity and performances in industrial environment.* [Scalable Architectures for Distributed Beam-Forming Synthetic Aperture Radar (DBSAR), Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mkr3-ntq7) - Conventional SAR operates in the Stripmap mode. Wide unambiguous swath coverage and high azimuth resolution pose contradictory requirements on the design of SAR systems. A promising technique to overcome this limitation is Digital Beam-Forming (DBF) on receive where the receiving antenna is split into multiple sub-apertures. This provides the capability of forming multiple beams via post-processing. DBF techniques applied to SAR systems can increase receiving antenna gain without a reduction of the imaged area and suppress interference signals. A highly capable DBSAR instrument design would consist of wideband Transmitter-Receiver Module (TRM), precise multi-channel timing and synchronization and reconfigurable processing engine that can host the SAR processing, calibration and control routines. IAI?s proposed approach is modular, scalable and meets the NASA goals of developing an innovative analog/digital hardware design for the implementation of distributed DBSAR architectures.* [Design of Laser-Based Remote Sensing Instrument for Measuring Ocean Temperature and Salinity Depth Profiles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nakv-537h) - <p>We propose to design an instrument with the capability to measure both temperature and salinity profiles of ocean mixed layers.&nbsp; We will design the key elements of the instrument including receiver design, measurement and detection schemes, laser transmitter characteristics, and overall link margin.&nbsp; Our plan is to create an instrument design that can potentially measure seawater salinity and vertical temperature profiles utilizing Brillouin and Raman scattering.&nbsp;</p><p>The objectives of the proposed instrument design effort are as follows:</p><p><em>(a)</em>&nbsp; Evaluating various Raman and Brillouin scattering techniques and determining how much information can likely be derived from them, and how well they could be incorporated into an aircraft instrument.</p><p><em>(b)</em>&nbsp; Determining link margins for potential Raman and Brillouin detection schemes, and defining crucial laser parameters including pulse width, repetition rate, pulse energy, and laser wavelength.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(c)</em>&nbsp; Designing a receiver system that can utilize the preferred scattering detection scheme(s).&nbsp; Also included in receiver design are calculations of required telescope FOV, optical throughput, coupling, and detector efficiency.</p><p><em>(d)</em>&nbsp; Design of laser transmitter &amp; hardware to meet instrument detection scheme requirements.</p><p>The science product of the proposed instrument is vertical profiles of water column temperature and salinity with 1 m resolution obtained from collected Brillouin and Raman scattering spectra. &nbsp;This is an early-stage innovation that would seek further funding for hardware development at the conclusion of this design effort.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>* [Monthly Climate Data for Selected USGS HCDN Sites, 1951-1990](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ycu5-pde9) - Time series of monthly minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were derived for 1337 watersheds in the conterminous United States for sites found in the national streamflow database, termed the hydroclimatologic data network (HCDN), developed by Slack et al. (1993a,b). Estimates were derived for the years 1951-1990.This HCDN data set consists of records of average daily streamflow at 1553 sites located throughout the United States. The data meet certain measurement accuracy criterion outlined by Slack et al. (1993). The HCDN contains river flows from 1874 to 1988, with an average record length of 44 years. The streamflow data included in the HCDN is purported to be relatively free from anthropogenic influences and the accuracy ratings of these records are at least rated good per USGS standards. A subset of the HCDN streamflow sites from 1337 watersheds with at least 10 years of record length was used. This subset includes 1376 HCDN sites.The climate characteristic estimates of temperature and precipitation were estimated using the PRISM (Daly et al. 1994, 1997) climate analysis system as described in Vogel, et al. 1999.Estimates of monthly potential evaporation were obtained using a method introduced by Hargreaves and Samani (1982) which is based on monthly time series of average minimum and maximum temperature data along with extraterrestrial solar radiation. Extraterrestrial solar radiation was estimated for each HCDN basin by computing the solar radiation over 0.1 degree grids using the method introduced by Duffie and Beckman (1980) and then summing those estimates for each river basin. This process is described in Sankarasubramanian, Vogel, and Limbrunner, 2001.The data files are organized in directories by parameter, Tmax, Tmin, Pre, and PET, and contain 18 subdirectories representing the 18 HCDN regions. Each region subdirectory contains data files for the monthly time series of respective hydroclimate attributes (Tmax, Tmin, Precipitation, and PET) for the individual HCDN sites in that region for the years 1951-1990. All files are in space delimited ASCII format.* [NACP Site: Terrestrial Biosphere Model and Aggregated Flux Data in Standard Format](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8ajf-ja3f) - This data set provides standardized output variables for gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), leaf area index (LAI), ecosystem respiration (Re), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H) from 24 terrestrial biosphere models for 47 eddy covariance flux tower sites in North America.

The files also contain gap-filled observations and total uncertainty estimates. The data set was compiled for the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Synthesis for use in model inter-comparison and assessment of how well the models simulate carbon processes across vegetation types and environmental conditions in North America. There is one compressed (.zip) file with this data set. When expanded, the .zip file contains model output data for one variable at one site.

NASA in collaboration with Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) has been conducting research in developing technologies to enable Distributed Engine Control (DEC) architectures. Realization of such future intelligent engines depends on the development of both hardware and software, including high temperature electronics and sensors to make smart components. NASA is particularly interested in the design and development of these applications for assessing the benefit they bring to the engine system. Compressor discharge pressure measurement has long been a key aspect of turbine engine control to manage stall margin. Given that, there is a need for a high-temperature, smart P3 sensor as a key building block for distributed engine controls. Given the current limitations of high temperature electronics, the business case for smart control elements (sensors and actuators) can be made in the fan/compressor section of the engine. The long-term objective of the proposed effort is to advance high-temperature P3 sensor technology for DEC applications through working with OEM partners and industry working groups to: (1) to iterate the current technology toward DEC formats/functions, (2) advance the digital electronics design/firmware and high temperature electronics, and (3) (through demonstration and stakeholder collaboration) present the viability (technical and business case) of the proposed sensor.* [Micro-atmospheric Microwell Plate Technology Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/52ic-2g3u) - <p>Valuable research in gravitational biology, synthetic biology, proteomics, and biotechnology can be enhanced by using microwell platforms.

It was calibrated to apparent surface reflectance using the ACORN atmospheric model.The Hyperion imager has a spectral range of 400-2500 nm, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, spatial resolution of 30 m, and a swath width of 7.8 km. Sampling is scene based (256 samples, 512 lines) (http://eo1.usgs.gov/sensors.php).  Through these large number of spectral bands, complex land ecosystems can be imaged and accurately classified.Data from the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer may greatly increase our ability to estimate the presence and structural attributes of selective logging in the Amazon Basin using four biogeophysical indicators not yet derived simultaneously from any satellite sensor: 1) green canopy leaf area index; 2) degree of shadowing; 3) presence of exposed soil and; 4) non-photosynthetic vegetation material. Airborne, field and modeling studies have shown that the optical reflectance continuum (400-2500 nm) contains sufficient information to derive estimates of each of these indicators. Our ongoing studies in the eastern Amazon basin also suggest that these four indicators are sensitive to logging intensity. Satellite-based estimates of these indicators should provide a means to quantify both the presence and degree of structural disturbance caused by various logging regimes.* [MERRA-Land 2d land surface diagnostics, Monthly (2/3x1/2L1) V5.2.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9v93-kab5) - The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is a state-of-the-art reanalysis data product that provides, in addition to atmospheric fields, global estimates of soil moisture, latent heat flux, snow, and runoff for 1979-present. A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

The fire detection strategy is based on absolute detection of a fire (when the fire strength is sufficient to detect), and on detection relative to its background (to account for variability of the surface temperature and reflection by sunlight). Numerous tests are employed to reject typical false alarm sources like sun glint or an unmasked coastline.

The existing methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the devices used are bulky, consumable-hungry, and ill-suited for spacecraft deployment. We propose to develop and demonstrate a novel, fully automated, microfluidics-based sensor for detection and identification of microbes in water. The final product will be compact, accurate, fully integrated and automated, power-effective, and fieldable in research and space environments. The program objectives will be accomplished via several innovations: (a) a milli-fluidic microbe preconcentrator to improve detection sensitivity; (b) CFDRC's proprietary dielectrophoresis technology will be adapted to develop a dielectrophoretic focuser for differentiation and separation of target microbes from complex sample matrices; and (c) microfluidic impedance spectroscopy-based cytometry to enable label-free detection and near reagent-free operation. In Phase I, we will demonstrate all critical components to establish proof-of-concept of the proposed technology. Phase II efforts will focus along two lines. First, component design optimization will be carried out with fabrication enhancements and extended testing and characterization for technology validation. Second, an integrated microfluidic cartridge and instrumentation capable of automated operation (sample processing and detection) will be developed. The prototype instrument will be demonstrated in both terrestrial and hypogravity environments (in collaboration with NASA researchers/facilities).* [The Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI): Update &amp; Second Launch Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hijg-4bfn) - &lt;p&gt;
	Particle acceleration in solar flares and its contribution to coronal heating are among the main&amp;nbsp; unsolved problems in heliophysics. Accelerated electrons in a plasma radiate hard X-ray (HXR)&amp;nbsp; emission through the well-known process of bremsstrahlung. HXR observations therefore are a&amp;nbsp; powerful diagnostic tool, providing quantitative measurements of flare-accelerated electrons. Since&amp;nbsp; bremsstrahlung emission depends on the density of the ambient medium, solar HXR emission is&amp;nbsp; usually brightest from below the transition region, where the density increases rapidly towards the&amp;nbsp; photosphere. Electron beams entering the chromosphere lose energy quickly through collisions and&amp;nbsp; produce relatively intense HXR emission at the footpoints of magnetic field lines. Electron beams&amp;nbsp; moving in the relatively tenuous corona suffer very few collisions, losing little energy and producing&amp;nbsp; only faint HXR emission. Present-day HXR instrumentation does not have the sensitivity to see&amp;nbsp; faint HXR emission from electrons traveling in the corona, nor the dynamic range to see such&amp;nbsp; faint emission in the presence of bright HXR footpoint emission in the chromosphere. Existing&amp;nbsp; observations therefore show us only where energetic electrons are stopped, but not where they&amp;nbsp; are accelerated, nor along what path they escape from the acceleration site. The most sensitive&amp;nbsp; solar HXR observations so far are provided by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Spectroscopic&amp;nbsp; Imager (RHESSI) (Lin et al. 2002). These measurements are obtained with a non-focusing rotation&amp;nbsp; modulation collimator (RMC) imaging technique (Hurford et al. 2002). RMCs and other types&amp;nbsp; of non-focusing imaging, however, have intrinsically limited dynamic range and sensitivity. HXR&amp;nbsp; focusing optics can overcome both of these limitations (Section 1.2.2).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) is a sounding rocket payload funded under the&amp;nbsp; NASA Low Cost Access to Space (LCAS) program to test HXR focusing optics combined with&amp;nbsp; silicon strip detectors for solar observations (Krucker et al. 2009). The FOXSI program is being led&amp;nbsp; by the Space Sciences Laboratory at UC Berkeley in collaboration with the Marshall Space Flight&amp;nbsp; Center (MSFC) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). FOXSI is on schedule&amp;nbsp; and on budget for a launch in October 2010. FOXSI will offer imaging spectroscopy and&amp;nbsp; unprecedented HXR sensitivity and dynamic range. FOXSI will be !100 times more sensitive than&amp;nbsp; RHESSI at 10 keV, and, for the first time, detect the non-thermal counterparts of quiet sun network&amp;nbsp; flares (Section 1.2.4).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here we propose a continuation of the FOXSI program which includes data analysis&amp;nbsp; and a second flight with an upgraded version of FOXSI. At moderate cost, we propose to&amp;nbsp; enhance the effective area, in particular at higher energies (by a factor of !4 at 15 keV), by adding&amp;nbsp; 3 more shells to the existing 7-shell optics (see Figure 9). Furthermore, our Japanese collaborators&amp;nbsp; will provide, at no cost, newly available double-sided cadmium telluride (CdTe) detectors as&amp;nbsp; a replacement for the Si detectors to allow us to take full advantage of the effective area at higher&amp;nbsp; energies. A second flight will therefore not only allow us to continue testing HXR focusing&amp;nbsp; optics for solar observations and also test newly developed CdTe strip detectors&amp;nbsp; in flight but is also expected to provide a significant increase in scientific return. In&amp;nbsp; this two year proposal, the first year (2011) will be used to upgrade the FOXSI payload and to&amp;nbsp; analyze data from the first flight, while the second flight is planned for the midd* [MOPITT Beta CO gridded daily means (Near Infrared Radiances) V107](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8vxh-8dm4) - The MOPITT Beta L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals and belong to an unvalidated beta product subject to recalibration.

Products include vector data showing (1) roads, (2) rivers, and (3) hypsography and (4) digital elevation model (DEM) images that were encoded from the hypsography vectors. There are 15 data files with this data set which includes 12 compressed *.zip files containing ArcInfo shape files and 3 GeoTIFFS.This data set contains vector data showing roads, rivers, and hypsography for each study area in ESRI ArcGIS shapefile format. The vectors were hand-digitized by the Images Company in Brazil from paper maps produced by the Brazilian government. Depending on the scale of the original maps, the digitization errors vary. For some maps, some vectors are missing. Data were manually checked for duplicate or extra vectors. These data sets were derived from several map sheets produced from aerial coverages dating from 1974 to 1978.The DEM images were encoded from the hypsography vectors and are provided in GeoTIFF format. The attribute value associated with each line and point in the vector segment is encoded into the image channel; the image channel is then filled in by interpolating image data between encoded vector data.  For each DEM:  1 image channel with pixel resolution = 25m x 25m.  DEM images are provided for Manaus, Tapajos National Forest, and Rondonia.  The files for Rio Branco were unusable due to a documentation error.DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products. KNOWN PROBLEMS:The data providers note that due to limited resources, these data have been neither validated nor quality-assured for general use. For that reason, extreme caution is advised when considering the use of these data. - Any use of the derived data is not recommended because the results have not been validated.- However, the DEM, vectors, and orthorectified SAR data (related data set) can be used if the user understands how these were produced and accepts the limitations.* [SRI CubeSat Imaging Radar for Earth Science: Instrument Development and Demonstration (CIRES-IDD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/r87t-meuj) - Space-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a key change-detection tool in NASA’s Earth Science Division portfolio. InSAR addresses three of the seven major themes summarized by the National Research Council Earth Sciences Decadal Survey: 1) solid-earth hazards and dynamics; 2) human health and security; and 3) land-use change, ecosystem dynamics, and biodiversity. All require global, frequent assessments of solid surface deformation via InSAR measurements.

For maximum impact, InSAR measurements must be precise (sub-cm level) and timely. Frequent acquisitions (sub-weekly) are needed to provide enhanced deformation precision through time series averaging, and ensure that an event is properly captured and characterized. Orbital mechanics prevent single-platform sensors from simultaneously achieving rapid revisit times and wide-area coverage. Multiple platforms are needed to avoid compromising coverage, but traditional InSAR sensors are too expensive (> $300M) to replicate.

Under the NASA ESTO IIP program, SRI International (SRI) and our team of collaborators propose to develop a complete SAR/InSAR instrument for CubeSats. The instrument is called CIRES-IDD (CubeSat Imaging Radar for Earth Science – Instrument Development and Demonstration). We will leverage SRI’s TRL-5 CIRES radar hardware developed under NASA ACT funding, SRI’s TRL 4 image formation software, and a TRL-3 high-gain deployable membrane antenna to form the complete instrument.

CIRES-IDD is a three-year program with ground and airborne unmanned aerial systems (UAS) demonstrations to retire technology risks and raise the CIRES-IDD system TRL from 3 to 6 in preparation for a future orbital demonstration campaign. The planned IIP period of performance is from 9 January 2017 to 8 January 2020. The following points summarize the maturation plan for each technology piece.

We will start by maturing the SAR/InSAR image-processing solution. SRI will apply their extensive set of SAR algorithms and coherent registration techniques to CIRES-IDD. We will test and debug the developed software on the UAS platform, followed by a rigorous calibration campaign. SRI experience with adapting the image formation tools to different systems (e.g., operational TRL-9 airborne radar systems) enables a relatively straightforward algorithm development path based on previously proven techniques.

Our antenna partner, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI), will develop the high-gain deployable membrane antenna (>36 dBi). PSI will iteratively develop and test increasing scales of antenna test articles, focusing on deployment, tensioning, packaging efficiency, and RF performance. Antenna risk reduction tests will include microgravity deployment and folding tests, among others.

Working with NASA Ames Research Center and the NASA Airborne Science Program, we will execute four UAS flight campaigns to validate CIRES-IDD utility at altitude. These flights will demonstrate the full SAR/InSAR performance capabilities (25-m imaging resolution, sub-cm-level InSAR accuracy, SNR >13 dB) and demonstrate scientific relevance. We have partnered with Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Stanford University, and the U.S. Geological Survey to identify local areas of interest and assist with analyzing and assessing the utility of the data for scientific research.

The lessons learned from UAS testing will be used to optimize the CIRES-IDD design features such as thermal resilience, power management, mass, volume, and sensor capabilities, thereby improving system performance and reducing risks for future on-orbit operations. Although the proposed project’s ultimate goal is to prepare and prove CIRES-IDD for future on-orbit CubeSat operations, the UAS SAR system resulting from this effort will become a useful scientific research platform in its own right, a capability also valued in the Decadal Survey.* [Development of Digital Micromirror Devices for Far-UV Applications](https://data.nasa.gov/d/shu3-ud6p) - We propose to develop commercially available digital micromirror devices (DMDs) for use in the far ultraviolet (FUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV) regimes of 100 nm – 400 nm, using recently developed FUV mirror coatings. DMDs can be used as rapidly reconfigurable “slit mask” object-selectors in space-based UV multi object spectrometers (MOS). Currently, DMDs are the only alternative to microshutter arrays, which were developed for the infrared MOS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The need for an efficient UV MOS has been identified as a Priority 1 Technological Gap by the general community, according to the Cosmic Origins 2016 Program Annual Technology Report. There are several missions currently in the planning process, which are developing concepts for multi-object spectrometers. For example both LUVOIR and HabEx plan to include such an instrument, working into the UV. Several smaller dedicated spectroscopic survey missions based around a highly multiplexed spectrometer have also been proposed. The choice of slit selector for such instruments is limited. While microshutter arrays are currently viewed as the frontrunner, the previous generation of microshutters has limitations and the next generation is still in early development. We have worked extensively on space qualification of the Texas Instruments DMDs and have shown the current generation of these devices to be ideal for space applications. However the deep UV (100 nm -300 nm) reflectivity of such devices needs to be substantially higher. We will re-coat commercially available DMDs (which use aluminum alloy mirrors) with high reflectivity aluminum, which is protected by an overcoat using recently developed FUV-enhanced thin films (LiF and AlF3). These protected aluminum coatings were developed to have a high reflectivity in the FUV range of 100 nm – 300 nm by two recent SAT projects. This work will build on our own previous SAT-funded efforts to determine the usability of DMDs in space and to extend their use into the NUV range of 200 nm – 400 nm. As part of this work we will produce re-coated DMDs with a high reflectivity in the FUV (with and without a protective window) and investigate the susceptibility of these devices to damage due to long exposures to highly energetic FUV photons. DMDs that operate in the FUV range will provide an alternative to microshutter arrays and help close a critical technology gap in FUV/NUV astronomy.* [Standoff Ultra-Compact Raman (SUCR) system Development for faster daytime mineralogy and Raman Imaging](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yiqk-29t9) - Raman spectroscopy can positively identify organic molecules, biomarkers, biominerals, water, water containing minerals, and minerals that are of high interest to NASA and directly serve the goal of finding evidence for past life on Mars and other planets. Micro-Raman systems are capable of performing fine-scale mineralogy; hence, they are being actively proposed as instruments on planetary rovers for in situ analysis. A micro-Raman system, Raman Laser Spectrometer (RLS), developed by Centro de Astrobiología, Unidad Asociada (CSIC-UVA), Spain is one of the Pasteur Payload instruments on board the ESA ExoMars rover to be launched in 2018. Similarly, JPL and Washington University in St. Louis, have developed a micro-Raman system, Mars Microbeam Raman Spectrometer (MMRS) with funding from NASA.
The RLS and MMRS are severely limited in their performance because (1) they require sample collection, (2) cannot be operated under daytime conditions, (3) provide poor Raman capabilities in presence of fluorescence, (4) cannot separate the highly desirable bio-florescence signal from unwanted mineral fluorescence signal, and (5) are too slow (1 to 60 s/spectrum). No Raman images will be expected from these systems due to these limitations. These disadvantages are due to the implementation of traditional Raman technology that is designed for dark laboratory use. These limitations will significantly lower the science return from these micro-Raman systems in terms of number and variety of samples that can be analyzed on Mars. 
Under this proposal, we propose to develop a new “Standoff Ultra-Compact Raman” (SUCR) instrument in collaboration with University of Hawaii which will solve all of the limitations listed above with the RLS and MMRS instruments. SUCR provides a superior micro-Raman instrument for future NASA missions. The development of SUCR will require improvements in both remote Raman and ultra-compact Raman technologies and the implementation of line imaging for faster Raman context imaging and map collection. The SUCR system will be able to quickly collect (1 s/spectrum) high quality in situ Raman spectral images in the daytime, from distances of several centimeters, with no need for samples collection. For example, the SUCR instrument will allow for fine scale context mineralogy of drilled cores, layer structures, and trenches. In addition, SUCR will be able to detect any micron size biomarker in situ with its faster search and scan mode (0.1s). Under this project, the TRL of the proposed SUCR instrument will advance from TRL 1 to TRL 3.* [Simplified, Parallelized InSAR Scientific Computing Environment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kxnc-zwrp) - There is a vast amount of SAR data that is challenging for scientists to use. We propose a variety of technologies in SAR processing that will accelerate the processing and the use of the science products. Specifically, we will:
1) Develop methods of computational acceleration by exploiting back projection methods on cloud-enabled GPU platforms to directly compute focused imagery in UTM (landsat grid). This will deliver SAR data to users as user-ready products, in a form that is most familiar to them from optical sensors and which has never been done before. It has been a major obstacle for scientists to adopt radar data. Once formed, the data can be accessed on standard GIS platforms. We could greatly reduce the processing complexity for users so they can concentrate on the science, and bring the products seamlessly into the 21st century tools that are rapidly evolving to handle the developing data explosion;
2) Develop python-based framework technologies at the user interface that support a more natural way for scientists to specify products and actions, thereby accelerating their ability to generate science results
3) Extend the ESTO-funded InSAR Scientific Computing Environment framework to uniformly treat polarimetric and interferometric time-series such as those that will be created by the NISAR mission using serialized product-based workflow techniques.
There are several key challenges that need to be addressed in parallel: 1) speed and efficiency in handling very large multi-terabyte time-series imagery data files. This requires innovations in multi-scale (GPU, node, cluster, cloud) workflow control; 2) framework technologies that can support the varied algorithms that these data can support, from SAR focusing, interferometry, polarimetry, interferometric polarimetry, and time-series processing; framework technologies that can support heterogeneous, multi-sensor data types (point-clouds and raster) in time and space.
NASA’s upcoming radar mission, NISAR, will benefit from this technology after its planned launch in 2021, but first the vast archive of all international missions such as the Sentinel-1 A/B data at the Alaska Satellite Facility can be exploited more fully.* [LIGHT-WEIGHT, NON-CONTACT MAGNETIC TRANSMISSION FOR UAV AND ROTORCRAFT APPLICATIONS, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/efhv-imr5) - Speed reducing units consisting of mechanical gears are widely used in applications to match high speed prime movers to low speed loads.  All aerospace applications of gearboxes require lubrication, maintenance, and overhaul; and are subject to eventually wearing out due to tooth surface wear and gear tooth fatigue.  In many cases the requirements for gearbox lubrication, maintenance/overhaul and service life limits are acceptable; but in some extreme applications these requirements become a severe performance limitation.  For example, high altitude long endurance missions (HALE) typically operate at an altitude greater than 60,000 feet and stay in flight for durations longer than 24 hours.  HALE vehicles need a lightweight, highly efficient solution to operate slow moving propellers maintenance free for an extended period of time in an extreme environment.  We are proposing to develop a magnetic gearbox technology that can meet the needs of these extreme applications.    A magnetic gearbox has many advantages over a traditional mechanical gearbox. The different rotating components in the magnetic gearbox will never touch so the only lubrication required is in the bearing systems.  The magnetic gearbox will be essentially maintenance-free except for periodic bearing lubrication/inspection.  Vibrations that do not exceed the pull-out torque of the magnetic teeth do not add measurably to the mechanical stresses in the magnetic gearbox so fatigue issues will be minimal.  If the pull-out (maximum) torque is exceeded the magnetic gearbox will simply skip a tooth and re-engage when the overload situation is resolved.   In the present research we have demonstrated an experimental magnetic gearbox that achieves much higher specific torque than any previously demonstrated design.* [CERES Bidirectional Scans Terra FM1 Edition3](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dwud-6dtt) - CER_BDS_Terra-FM1_Edition3 data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.Each Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data product contains twenty-four hours of Level-1b data for each CERES scanner instrument mounted on each spacecraft. The BDS includes samples taken in normal and short Earth scan elevation profiles in both fixed and rotating azimuth scan modes (including space, internal calibration, and solar calibration views). The BDS contains Level-0 raw (unconverted) science and instrument data as well as the geolocated converted science and instrument data. The BDS contains additional data not found in the Level-0 input file, including converted satellite position and velocity data, celestial data, converted digital status data, and parameters used in the radiance count conversion equations.      CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful  Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002. The newest CERES instrument (FM5) was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011.* [GPM GROUND VALIDATION AUTONOMOUS PARSIVEL UNIT (APU) NSSTC V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wjbd-uwww) - The GPM Ground Validation Autonomous Parsivel Unit (APU) NSSTC dataset was collected by the Autonomous Parsivel Unit (APU), which is an optical disdrometer based on single particle extinction that measures particle size and fall velocity. This APU consists of the Parsivel, which was developed by OTT in Germany, and its support systems, which were designed and built by the University of Alabama in Huntsville. This dataset provides rainfall data for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission Ground Validation Experiment collected at the National Space Science Technology Center (NSSTC) in Huntsville, Alabama. The validation effort will entail numerous GPM-specific and joint-agency/international external field campaigns, using state of the art cloud and precipitation observational infrastructure. Surface rainfall will be measured by very dense rain gauge and disdrometer networks at various field campaign sites. There may be occasional gaps in the data when the instrument is not resident at the NSSTC and is sent to participate in field campaigns.* [Oxygen Delivery System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/edq7-rpyi) - NASA’s Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) is charged to reduce the risk of adverse health and mission outcomes due to limitations of in-flight medical capabilities.  They have identified a number of technology gaps, one of which is:     <p></p>
Current spaceflight oxygen delivery systems deliver pure oxygen to the crewmember from high pressure oxygen tanks, which results in a gradual increase in cabin oxygen levels and a localized area of increased oxygen concentration in the vicinity of the crewmember, posing an increased fire hazard.        <p></p>
The Oxygen Concentrator Module (OCM) project is tasked with developing an oxygen delivery system with variable oxygen capability that minimizes localized oxygen build-up and meets the commercial crew vehicle evacuation requirements.      <p></p>
Work focuses on the development of a supplemental oxygen delivery system for crewmembers that pulls oxygen out of the ambient environment instead of using compressed oxygen.  This provides better resource optimization and reduces fire hazard by preventing the formation of localized pockets of increased oxygen concentration within the vehicle.  The system will provide oxygen support in a closed cabin environment where the atmosphere may be at a reduced pressure and elevated oxygen percentage (compared to terrestrial standard atmosphere composition and pressure).       <p></p>
Future space missions will take astronauts beyond Earth’s orbit.  These exploration missions may be long in duration (e.g., 36 months) and will have limited resources.  It is vital that each piece of equipment serve as many functions as possible, with built in redundancy.  A modular oxygen concentrator that uses the ambient cabin air can serve a number of functions (medical emergency, pre-breathing, atmospheric contamination, or leak) without taxing other spacecraft systems to compensate for an increase in ambient oxygen. This improves mission safety by not exacerbating fire risk, and minimizing system interdependencies.    <p></p>
This gap aligns well with the International Space Station (ISS) Health Maintenance System (HMS) because HMS currently has no oxygen delivery system that can meet commercial crew vehicle evacuation requirements. Concentrating oxygen from cabin air eliminates the up mass associated with oxygen tanks and reduces fire hazard, as it prevents the formation of localized pockets of increased oxygen levels within the vehicle.       <p></p>
An oxygen concentrator for crew medical support is considered vital to provide an ill crewmember with ventilation with oxygen.   Providing a method of oxygen therapy that uses cabin air keeps the oxygen levels stable and avoids Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) intervention required to maintain the cabin oxygen levels.      <p></p>
The medical conditions requiring oxygen supplementation include: Altitude sickness, Anaphylaxis, Burns, Choking/obstructed airway, Cough –URI, bronchitis, pneumonia, inhalation, De Novo cardiac arrhythmia, Decompression sickness, Headache (CO2, SAS, other), Infection – sepsis, Medication overdose/misuse, Neck injury, Radiation sickness, Seizure, Smoke inhalation, and Toxic exposure.    <p></p>
The final flight system for an oxygen delivery system needs to be Food & Drug Administration (FDA) clearable device and should be designed to minimize mass, volume, and power.  A demonstration unit for the International Space Station (ISS) should verify the technology and provide oxygen capability for ISS.      <p></p>
There are two US oxygen delivery systems currently used onboard the ISS--the Respiratory Support Pack (RSP) and the Portable Breathing Apparatus (PBA). The RSP uses the ISS 120 psi oxygen lines and delivers pure oxygen up to 12 L/min. The RSP is for medical O2 usage.  The PBA consists of a non-refillable portable oxygen bottle that provides 15 minutes of oxygen and also includes a 30 foot hose to attach to the ISS oxygen lines for long term oxygen supply.

1. Project Aims     <p></p>
The twinkling artifact (TA) is a rapid color-shift that selectively highlights hard objects such as kidney stones in color-Doppler ultrasound images; however, its inconsistent appearance has limited its clinical use. Our objective is to develop an ultrasound imaging protocol to enhance kidney stone detection in space, addressing ExMC Gap 4.13. In the 3rd year renewal proposal, the aims are: AIM 1: Develop, refine, and test in space analogs improved ultrasound imaging protocols to enhance kidney stone detection. AIM 2: Determine the effect of breathing gas composition on twinkling in swine. AIM 3: Determine the role of bacteria in twinkling.     <p></p>
2. Key Findings     <p></p>
Twinkling was reduced when 9 swine were exposed to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels (similar to what is found on the International Space Station (ISS)) with the degree of reduction in twinkling correlating with the concentration of CO2; twinkling increased when swine were exposed to 100% oxygen. When 4 swine were exposed to elevated CO2 levels versus normal air, there was an unrecoverable decrease in twinkling over the course of the study. Concentrations of gases in the blood and urine suggest both O2 and CO2 contribute to twinkling. Imaged 7 human subjects in the hyperbaric chamber and found a statistically significant increase in twinkling when subjects breathe 100% O2 at 1.6 ATA (the decompression stop) compared to initial twinkling levels. Growing several different species of bacteria on sterilized stones did not induce or increase twinkling; bacteria grown on agar plates also did not twinkle. Found evidence suggesting the contribution of internal micro-cracks to twinkling in addition to the surface crevice bubbles. Low frequency ultrasound was found to enhance twinkling if already present on stones, but did not cause non-twinkling stones to twinkle. Published 2 papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals; 4 additional papers are in preparation. Presented at 5 scientific conferences including an invited talk at the Acoustical Society of America Meeting in Honolulu, HI. Mentored a Pacific Science Center summer high school student and a summer undergraduate student. Organized a Wide World of Sound Booth at Engineering Discovery Days as Chair of the Outreach Committee, Cascadia Regional Chapter, Acoustical Society of America. Was interviewed for 2 National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI)/University of Washington promotional videos and a book on women in science. Accepted a tenure-track assistant professor position in the Graduate Program in Acoustics, Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University.     <p></p>
3. Impact     <p></p>
We have discovered that breathing CO2 significantly reduces twinkling in swine and have shown that breathing normal air (0.04% CO2) is insufficient to restore twinkling. The results also suggest that breathing elevated O2 may restore or enhance twinkling, which is supported in our human hyperbaric study. Bacteria grown on sterile stones or agar plates was found to be insufficient to induce or enhance twinkling; bacteria may need to be present in the stone formation process to contribute to twinkling. While increasing the energy delivered to the stone or lowering the transmitted frequency has been found to enhance twinkling, there remains some stones that do not twinkle. Further investigation into the stone formation process and/or the presence or absence of internal micro-cracks, which have been shown to play a role in twinkling in addition to the surface crevice bubbles, may help elucidate why some stones are resistant to twinkling so new techniques can be developed.     <p></p>
4. Proposed research     <p></p>
While this project is ended with NSBRI, we plan to finish recruiting and imaging the last subject for the human hyperbaric study and plan to submit 3 more journal publications. We are also looking to investigate* [Measuring, Monitoring, and Regulating Teamwork for Long Duration Missions](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vvad-pbed) - <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"

<p>Teamwork processes – entailing cognitive, motivational, affective,
  and behavioral aspects – have been researched in the psychological and
  behavioral sciences for well over a half century. Several lines of
  systematic research, large scale literature reviews, and meta-analytic
  summaries have firmly established that team processes, as key
  indicators of psycho-social team health, are critical contributors to
  team effectiveness, especially for “action” teams performing complex,
  interdependent tasks. Disruptions to teamwork jeopardize, due to
  conflict, low cohesion, or poor collaboration, have the potential to
  threaten team effectiveness. This is particularly the case under the
  isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) conditions that can be
  anticipated for long duration space missions. These difficult
  operating environments are further challenged by high team autonomy
  and time lagged communications with ground. For high reliability
  teams, a disruption in good teamwork, especially at an inopportune
  time when well-coordinated teamwork is critical, can have disastrous
  consequences. Thus, the capability for NASA to measure, monitor, and
  regulate good teamwork interactions for flight crews and ground
  control teams is essential for overall mission effectiveness for the
  NASA strategic plan for space exploration. Developing this
  countermeasure capability is the goal of this ongoing research
  program. This proposed ground-based research is designed to address
  the following Program Requirements Document (PRD) Risk and Behavioral

  indicators, and life cycle of the team for autonomous, long duration
  and/or distance exploration missions. The proposed research has three
  specific aims and associated deliverables that represent an integrated
  approach for measuring, monitoring, and regulating teamwork processes
  and long-term team functioning: (1) Benchmark long duration team
  functioning in ICE analog environments. This research uses Experience
  Sampling Methods (ESM; daily assessments) to assess team functioning
  in ICE environments. The product of this research aim quantifies the
  expected range of variation in key teamwork processes (e.g., cohesion,
  collaboration, conflict), identifies internal and external shocks that
  influence variation, and assesses dynamic effects on team functioning.
  Benchmark data in ICE analog environments are essential for developing
  standards to distinguish expected variation in teamwork from anomalies
  indicative of a threat to team functioning. Such standards are
  essential for triggering countermeasures / interventions. (2) Extend
  engineering development of an unobtrusive monitoring technology (i.e.,
  a wearable wireless sensor package). The product of this research aim
  advances development of a prototype monitoring technology to capture
  dynamic multimodal (i.e., physical, physiological, and behavioral)
  data capturing team member and teamwork interactions. Initial
  validation demonstrated the reliability and accuracy of the monitoring
  technology sufficient to establish proof of concept. Extensions
  include making the system more robust (i.e., packaging, energy
  efficiency, hardware, algorithms, and software) and developing a
  Bluetooth module for integrating additional sensors. (3) Develop

<p>The long-term goal of the proposed research is to deliver a software
  tool (currently referred to by its working title of “Team Performance
  Task” [TPT]) that will allow long-duration exploration crews to
  autonomously derive objective, standardized, and quantifiable measures
  on social dynamics while serving as a decision-aid tool in astronaut
  selection and multinational crew composition. This approach is unique
  because it is simple, rapid, and operationally feasible like a
  questionnaire, but is entirely objective, is innovative in that it
  requires a group-level demonstration of social dynamics rather than
  relying on individual opinions, and is language-independent, thus
  making it suitable for cross-cultural applications. Such an
  empirically validated and operationally feasible software deliverable
  will contribute to an overall risk mitigation strategy comprised of
  quantitative, qualitative, objective, and subjective assessment
  technologies. To accomplish this, we have been conducting ground-based
  experiments to systematically investigate the effects of group
  composition (gender and personality) on voluntary cooperative
  propensity in 3-person teams. We are also assessing the predictive
  validity of pre-mission TPT &quot;social personality profiles&quot;
  and the effects of group composition on performance, task cohesion,
  social cohesion, and biopsychosocial adaptation in mixed-gender
  &quot;crews&quot; participating in a long-term simulated space
  exploration task. We are also developing next-generation software to
  advance the technology beyond our current prototype used for
  proof-of-concept/validation research into a broadly applicable tool
  with cross-platform networking and connectivity, enhanced
  usability/human factors features, extensive parameter
  manipulation/flexibility to maximize sensitivity, and integrated data
  collection and processing capabilities. The proposed project will
  elucidate the influences of personality, gender, behavior, and
  neurobiology at the individual and group levels while yielding
  powerful experimental insights on the relationships between group
  composition, mission performance, task cohesion, social cohesion, and
  psychosocial adaptation in long-term work groups. The work will
  provide a scientifically validated TPT concept translated into a
  flexible and operationally acceptable software tool suitable for field

A separate National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) project (SMST02803) led to the development of 3-D ophthalmic ultrasound imaging on the current operational ultrasound platform (GE Vivid q) on board the International Space Station (ISS). The FUS is a state-of-the-art software beamforming architecture based on the GE Vivid E95 cardiovascular system with enhanced imaging capabilities. The FUS is switchable between its two operating modes, a high-quality clinical imager and a configurable research system with full control of the ultrasound acquisition and processing. Mechanical 3-D probes, like the prototype ophthalmic probe previously developed, are not compatible with the FUS platform and the frequency range of the electronic 3-D probes supported by the FUS platform are not suitable for ophthalmic imaging. The hardware and software differences between the current ISS ultrasound system and the newer FUS platform required additional effort to enable the ophthalmic imaging capabilities on the FUS.    
The goals for this project are to integrate the prototype 3-D ophthalmic probe onto the FUS for 2-D imaging and develop new hardware to connect the current volume acquisition hardware to the FUS for 3-D imaging. The approach seeks to minimize the hardware and software development through the reuse of existing components and implementation of the ultrasound imaging in the clinical mode of the FUS. The target outcome is preliminary lab testing of the 3-D imaging on the FUS. The scope of the project does not include fabrication of new volume acquisition hardware, exploring all of the advanced imaging on the FUS, acoustic safety testing, or integration with the FUS's acoustic output safety control for human scanning.    
A commercially-available probe adapter was modified allowing connection of the prototype ophthalmic probe to the FUS, and the FUS software was modified to recognize the prototype probe. Several new ophthalmic imaging modes were implemented in the FUS's clinical software to enable 2-D imaging on the FUS. This implementation, as opposed to implementation in the research mode, leveraged the clinical image quality on the FUS and reduced the development time. Additionally, the initial integration utilized two of the FUS's advanced imaging modes which included true confocal imaging to improve image resolution and virtual apex for broader anatomical coverage. The probe adapter was further modified to interface the probe's control signals with the previously-developed volume acquisition hardware, and the probe adapter was connected to a breadboard-version of the volume acquisition hardware allowing initial testing of the 3-D acquisitions on the FUS.    
The first 2-D images of an ultrasound phantom were acquired on the FUS and an initial integration test of the 3-D acquisition hardware on the FUS was completed. The 2-D imaging tests demonstrated improved depth of focus, higher spatial resolution, and larger anatomical coverage with the FUS. The 3-D integration testing revealed a hardware issue resulting in non-uniform rotation of the mechanical 3-D probe during the acquisitions and the source narrowed down to corruption of the control signals in the probe adapter box. Further effort is required to better isolate these signals in the probe adapter box and provide the uniform rotation of the ultrasound transducer array necessary for accurate reconstruction of the ultrasound data from the 3-D acquisition.* [Sample Processor for Life on Icy Worlds (SPLIce)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mfst-8g4x) - INTRODUCTION, GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

We propose to develop, mature and integrate microfluidic sample-processing components and technologies into a platform to support life detection and habitability characterization of Encela-dus and Europa. Our goal is to enable and enhance spacecraft-based instrument performance by providing wet-chemical processing of samples obtained above, on, or beneath frozen surfaces of ocean worlds. Objectives include demonstrating the capability to accept and process the sorts of samples anticipated from ocean-world missions and to process them to meet the specific re-quirements of several instruments being developed for ocean-worlds missions.
METHODOLOGY

The Sample Processor for Life on Icy Worlds (SPLIce) will heavily leverage technology readi-ness level (TRL) 7-9 spaceflight-qualified/proven fluidic components from multiple nanosatellite payloads, as well as funded future missions to interplanetary space and Earth orbit. Thus, it will advance the TRL of a system composed of multiple existing technologies at various TRLs. Rele-vant demonstrated nanosatellite technologies include microfluidic design, development, fabrica-tion, integration, and test approaches, as well as stringent sterility and cleanliness protocols. The enabling components and technologies span TRL 3-5 in the context of a payload system to sup-port ocean-world exploration. SPLIce will be matured to an integrated system with an exit TRL of 5 and a demonstrable path to TRL 6 by preliminary design review for, e.g., a New Frontiers mission opportunity.
SPLIce development will be guided by two key principles: (1) to be general and capable, inte-grating functions serving both common and disparate needs of multiple instruments; (2) to reduce analytical risk by delivering characterized, pre-processed sample aliquots according to each in-strument’s input requirements. SPLIce functions include: sample retrieval from a collector; rea-gent, buffer and standard reconstitution and delivery; dilution; concentration; degassing/de-bubbling; removing interfering ions; adjusting pH or ionic strength; adding dyes/molecular labels to facilitate detection; filtering, capturing, staining of insoluble particles for microscopy; deliver-ing particle-free aliquots to instruments.
To reduce risk and improve reliability while supporting multiple analytical instruments, SPLIce includes parallelism and redundancy: the sample is divided at the earliest logical stage following retrieval from the sample collector. Associated mass, volume, and complexity penalties are min-imal due to monolithic integration of fluidic features and components.
NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and our partners are uniquely suited to mature, augment, and develop SPLIce: ARC has extensive spaceflight heritage with integrated microfluidic archi-tectures and our team is well experienced with high-heritage instruments suited to life detection and habitability characterization.
RELEVANCE

SPLIce will significantly improve instrument performance and enhance certainty of results for ocean-worlds missions including potential future Discovery and New Frontiers opportunities. As described in the COLDTech announcement, SPLIce is a “sample distribution system capable of parsing and delivering samples to multiple instruments, and to one instrument multiple times, in order to reproduce results with the same, as well as different, instruments.” Further, our project “focuses on advancing the technology readiness level of a system composed of multiple existing technologies at various TRLs.”
SPLIce directly addresses NASA, SMD, and COLDTech program goals: it focuses on ocean world flyby, orbital, and surface missions such as the Europa lander; it is suited for multiple pay-loads and implementations. The planned 2017 release of an Announcement of Opportunity for the New Frontiers Program mission investigations of ocean worlds, including the search for signs of extant life, is a key target.* [Development of Large Area (100x100 mm) photon counting UV detectors](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6xrc-qw46) - Microchannel Plate (MCP) detectors have been an essential imaging technology in space based NASA UV missions for decades and have been used in numerous orbital and interplanetary instruments. The reasons for this are many: they have high QE in the extreme and far ultraviolet; they are photon counting with high spatial and temporal resolution; they are available in various large, adaptable formats, even curved; readout electronics can be compact, low mass and low power; they do not require cryogens; and they are quite radiation hard. However, as with any detector technology, they have had their limitations: lower QE in the near UV, MCPs with fixed pattern noise; and limited lifetime and dynamic range as a result of high gain operation. The first of these limitations is being addressed by an APRA grant on GaN photocathodes and the second has been largely ameliorated by new MCP fabrication techniques by Industry. We have addressed the remaining issues with our Cross Strip (XS) anode readout technology. We are currently near the end of our SAT program where we were funded in increase the TRL of XS readout electronics by converting our bulky and high power laboratory designs into application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are lower power and lower mass. We also developed a standard 50x50mm XS MCP detector that was tested in flight like environments (thermal-vacuum and vibration). We now have in hand the higher TRL 50mm detector and the ASICs to read it out. The goal of this SAT proposal is to now scale the 50x50 mm detector to 100 x100 mm XS detector using these ASIC and scaling the detector mechanical structure and anode by a factor of two (four in area) in an aggressive 2 year program. The basic ASIC design will not change except we will migrate the 250nm CMOS technology to a more modern 130nm CMOS technology that is known to be faster and more radiation resistant. With this new effort we will have an adaptable prototype 100 mm detector qualified for flight-like environments.

Cross Strip readouts collect the charge exiting from a stack of MCPs with two sets of coarsely spaced and electrically isolated orthogonal conducting strips. When the charge collected on each strip is measured, a centroid calculation determines the incident location of the incoming event (photon or particle). This requires many identical amplifiers (e.g. 160, 320) whose individual outputs must all be digitized and analyzed. The advantage this technique has over existing and previous MCP readout techniques (wedge and strip, delayline, intensifiers) is that the anode capacitance per amplifier is lower, resulting in a higher SNR. This allows lower gain operation (factors of ~20) while still achieving better spatial resolution. Furthermore, lower gain operation of the MCPs increases both their lifetime and the local counting rate capability.

We plan to take this 50 mm XS technology and scale it up to 100x100mm and raise it to TRL6 from TRL4 by proposing to: (1) Test the sensitivity of the new ASICs to high radiation doses and migrate them to a more robust 130nm CMOS technology; (2) Develop a spaceflight compatible 100x100 mm XS detector that integrates with these electronics and can be tested as a system in flight-like environments while maintaining the imaging performance achieve with the smaller detector (&lt; 20µm FWHM spatial resolution, spatial linearity of &lt; 10µm, count rates &gt; 2MHz , 10% deadtime etc). This detector design can be used directly in many rocket, satellite and interplanetary UV instruments and could be easily adapted to different sizes and shapes to match various mission requirements. Having this detector flight design available will also reduce cost and development risk for future Explorer class missions. New technological developments in photocathodes (e.g. GaN) or MCPs (e.g. low background, surface engineered borosilicate glass MCPs) would be able to be accommodated into this design as their TRL levels increase.* [Multi-Functional 3-D Printed Customized Luneburg Lens Antennas for Future Earth Science Applications](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qbw3-kd2g) - <p>This research project develops a practical multi-band scanning lens beamforming array antenna based on the principle of a Luneburg Lens (LL). Modern nature-inspired optimization methods and additive manufacturing methods enable design of non-spherical lenses in order to reduce mass and volume. New lens designs enable rapid beam scan and multi-beam antenna technology by using an array of electronic modules. The new technology will overcome mechanical scan rate and beam agility limitations that currently limits radar performance.</p><p>The goal of this research is practical multi-band scanning antenna technology that can replace complex mechanical scanning assemblies such as the mechanically spun reflectors used to achieve conical scanning on QuikScat/RapidScat class of scatterometers. Mechanical scan systems have proven to be the key single point failure that limited mission lifetime. Moreover, the new technology will overcome mechanical scan limitations beam agility and scan rate that limits radar performance. The approach in this research is a lens beamforming array based on the principle of a Luneburg Lens (LL) that is capable of full 2D scan. The classical LL is an inhomogeneous sphere in which the dielectric constant decreases with distance from the center, providing extremely large bandwidth, unlimited scan range and no scan loss. This research uses modern nature-inspired optimization methods in conjunction with additive manufacturing methods to extend the advantages of LL technology to non-spherical lenses in order to reduce mass and volume. These new lens designs form the basis of a new class of beam scan and multi-beam antenna technology which utilizes an array of electronic modules in order to provide rapid beam switching and scanning.</p>* [LIfE: Luminescence Imager for Exploration](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9y7h-rvgh) - NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) will mature a microfluidic-based fluorescence imaging microscope for the detection and study of biomarkers and structural indicators of microbial life in icy world environments. The Luminescence Imager for Exploration (LIfE) instrument is a microfluidic platform designed for biostructure fluorescence imaging using deep-ultraviolet (DUV) and visible light excitation. LIfE heritage is derived from the Fluorescence Analysis for In-situ Research on Nanosatellites (FLAIR) imager developed at ARC for the the study of C. elegans in Low Earth Orbit. LIfE will leverage ARC nanosatellite fabrication capabilities including stringent sterility and cleanliness requirements as well as general microfluidic design, development, fabrication, integration, sterilization, and test approaches. Although the current TRL of FLAIR is 6, in the context of an integrated system for icy world exploration, the current TRL of LIfE is 3, driven by its lowest TRL subsystems. Under this COLDTech, LIfE will be matured to an end-to-end system with a project exit TRL of 5.
LIfE will collect samples onto a sub-micron filter and analyze them using fluorescence imaging with sub-micron spatial resolutions enabling the detection and quantification of bacterium-sized structures. During analysis of the samples, LIfE will operate using two modes of fluorescence analysis:
1) Utilizing fluorescence stains specific to key structural biomarkers, i.e., typical membrane constituents such as fatty acids, phospholipid bilayers, and membrane proteins.
2) Using DUV and visible light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for the excitation of native luminescence in the samples. The inclusion of a DUV-excitation source will allow LIfE to operate without the use of stains which may not bind to the structural components of extraterrestrial life forms.
LIfE directly addresses the goals of future NASA missions by providing life detection technology suitable for flyby, orbital, and landed missions and multiple payloads and payload implementations. LIfE directly addresses the COLDTech program through the development of a spacecraft-based instrument for surface and subsurface exploration of ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus. LIfE is directly applicable to the Europa lander mission concept as described in the COLDTech Announcement of Opportunity. LIfE addresses NASA Planetary Science Division’s strategic goals and objectives and is focused on the detection of extant life in the "Ocean Worlds" of the outer Solar System.* [Reflective Spatial Heterodyne Spectrometers for high-resolving-power emission-line characterization from orbital and remote missions.](https://data.nasa.gov/d/axtg-bcvz) - High-resolution spectroscopy is an important tool for remote sensing of energetic, Doppler, and radiative transfer phenomena in the solar system. However, the technical constraints on the most common spectroscopic instrument designs (e.g. Echelle spectrometers) have limited our ability to deliver high resolving power capabilities to solar system targets via remote probes. This limitation is particularly acute at short wavelengths where the spectrum of solar system targets is dominated by emission lines free from contamination by solar continuum and where high resolving power would be especially effective.
We propose here to continue development of the reflective spatial heterodyne spectrometer (SHS), an instrumental technique that combines high resolving power with exceptional sensitivity in a compact volume that enables their use in remote probes. SHS is a common-path Fourier transform spectrometer that achieves high sensitivity with a large intrinsic field of view that makes it well suited for orbital and flyby observations of planetary/satellite atmospheres, magnetospheric plasmas, and comets comae.
We have constructed 3 demonstration prototypes of reflective SHS instruments under NASA support that have been used successfully at ground based facilities and on a sounding rocket to observe water group emissions from H, O, and OH within narrow bandpasses that collectively cover the wavelength range from 120 to 630 nm. As part of this program we would advance these laboratory instruments from their current TRLs of 3-5. This will be achieved through improved mechanical designs emphasizing thermal tolerance and stability under flight stress in a smaller format, development of automated alignment capabilities, incorporation of an EMCCD photon counting detector system, and enhancement of wavelength coverage through the use of multi-order gratings.* [Hybrid lightweight X-ray optics for half arcsecond imaging](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vqgk-sbwb) - This proposal is for the development of grazing incidence optics suitable to meet the 0.5 arcsec imaging and 2.3 square meter effective area requirements of the X-ray Surveyor mission concept, currently under study by NASA. Our approach is to  combine two promising technologies, as yet individually unproven at the 0.5 arcsec level, into a hybrid mirror approach. The two technologies are thin piezoelectric film adjustable optics under development at SAO and PSU, and differential deposition under development at NASA MSFC. These technologies are complementary: adjustable optics are best suited to fixing low spatial frequency errors due to piezoelectric cell size limitations, and differential deposition is best suited for fixing mid-spatial frequency errors so as to limit the amount of material that must be deposited. Thus, the combination of the two techniques extends the bandwidth of figure errors that can be corrected beyond what it was for either individual technique. Both technologies will be applied to fabricate Wolter-I mirror segment from single thermally formed glass substrates.

This work is directed at mirror segments only (not full shells), as we believe segments are the most appropriate for developing the ~ 3 m diameter X-ray Surveyor high resolution mirror. In this program we will extend differential deposition to segment surfaces (from line profiles), investigate the most realistic error bandwidths for each technology, and determine the impacts of one technology’s processing steps on the other to find if there is an optimal order to combining the technologies. In addition, we will also conduct a conical/cylindrical mirror metrology "round-robin," to cross-calibrate the different cylindrical metrology to one another as a means of minimizing systematic errors. Finally, we will examine the balancing and compensating of mirror stress due to the various thin films employed (piezoelectric layer, differential deposition, X-ray reflecting layer(s)) with an eye to minimizing the net stress post-processing such that the residual stress-induced deformations are well within the correction range of the adjustable optic technology. As feasible, hybrid Wolter mirrors will be fabricated and measured via optical metrology (post-round-robin).

By looking to develop the combination of these two technologies, while also looking to separately advance each one, this program provides important risk reduction for the key enabling technology of X-ray Surveyor – the mirrors.* [Microfluidic Ion Analyzer for Astrobiological Studies](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4nwi-b92n) - JPL has made consistent progress over the last decade to develop portable lab-on-a-chip systems for detection of biomarkers with extremely high sensitivity (parts per trillion).1-4 However, the detection method (laser-induced fluorescence, LIF) requires that samples be mixed with dyes that attach to the biomarkers and make them fluoresce. These additional processing steps increase the overall size and complexity of the instrument package. At the same time, it is clear now that an understanding of the chemical environment surrounding potential biosignatures is critical to rationally select proper sample handling and detection methods. This information is also crucial in the process of interpreting the resulting data sets obtained during the analysis. This proposal addresses these points by integrating a universal conductivity-based detector into a lab-on-a-chip system that can search for salts and biomarkers simultaneously while greatly simplifying both the instrument and its operation.Our proposal is built upon three key research objectives:

O1 - Development of protocols for simultaneous analysis of inorganic and organic ions with ME-C4D. (Initial TRL 2, final TRL 4)

O2 - Demonstration of analysis on inorganic and organic ions by ME-C4D in relevant environmental samples. (Initial TRL 2, final TRL 4) 

O3 – Design of a miniaturized ME-C4D instrument dedicated to simultaneous analysis of inorganic and organic ions. (This work will leverage from instruments previously developed in our laboratory, initial TRL 3, final TRL 4)

This effort will provide the capability to detect ionic species directly in liquid samples or following extraction from solid samples, or melting of ice samples (i.e. from the surface or jets of Enceladus or Europa). Samples are simply dissolved in the appropriate buffer and analyzed by microchip electrophoresis coupled to contactless conductivity detection. We will develop protocols for simultaneous analysis of both inorganic and organic ions with a single miniaturized instrument and without labeling. This new capability will provide a major leap forward in NASA’s ability to obtain the chemical composition of Martian regolith as well as Europa’s subsurface ocean. The ionic composition will help us understand the chemical processes and the possibility of past and present life in these targets highly relevant to future in situ missions.* [All-Reflective Spatial Heterodyne Spectroscopy: Extending High Sensitivity Velocity Resolved Measurements of Solar System Dynamics into the EUV](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wr4s-sjn2) - The EUV spectral region contains ion and neutral transitions that track energetic processes in the solar system at scales from planetary upper atmospheres to the entire heliosphere. EUV signatures are typically associated with transition effects such as shock boundaries, energy deposition sites (aurorae & ionospheres), magnetic field aligned accelerations and gryo-motion (in magnetospheres or the solar corona), plasma pickup processes (e.g. Io plasma torus, comet ion tails, planetary exospheres) and interactions between different particle populations (e.g. resonant charge exchange). A shared characteristic of these processes is that their individual EUV emission features have Doppler signatures that reveal acceleration, multimodal velocity components, and thermal & non-thermal forcing effects that provide unique insight into the underlying processes giving rise to them. The perceived importance of EUV remote sensing of these processes for solar system studies is demonstrated by the frequent presence of imaging and spectroscopic instruments on remote probes (e.g. Voyager, BepiColombo, Cassini, New Horizons) and their inclusion in Earth-orbiting observatories (e.g. HUT, IMAGE, EUVE, SOHO). Unfortunately the existing state of the art in EUV instrumentation is unable to resolve the very Doppler features that contain the most important information in the emission features under study. The lack of a high spectral resolution capability for EUV remote sensing is due primarily to the technical limitations at short wavelengths. Neither transmitting optics nor high efficiency mirror coatings are available in this spectral range.  Commonly used broadband materials deliver only modest reflectance (20-50% per surface) that degrades rapidly for wavelengths < 40 nm. Multilayer coatings targeting narrow bandpasses can improve efficiency, but the throughput losses for EUV instruments relative to those at longer wavelengths can still reach several orders of magnitude for multi-element optical systems. When the low surface brightness and broad spatial extent of most observable features in the EUV are factored in, the resulting low throughput of other high-resolution spectroscopic instruments effectively eliminates them as useful tools in this range. 

The goal of this proposed effort is to address the ‘resolution gap’ in EUV spectroscopy through demonstration of an all-reflective, common-path EUV spatial heterodyne spectrometer (ARCSHS). SHS instruments able to sample a relatively large field of view at high resolving power (R~100,000) and can be made compact enough to fit within the mass and volume limitations of space probes while delivering an etendue 100-1000 times greater than instruments at large telescopes (e.g.  HST-STIS). Development of the Spatial Heterodyne Extreme Ultra-Violet Interferometer (SHEUVI) will be a first for both high spectral resolving power and interference spectroscopy at lambda <90 nm. Astronomical interferometry has not been attempted the EUV, because the optical surface quality and mechanical accuracy requirements of most common astrophysical implementations have been, and remain beyond practical reach. Both theory and testing have shown the interferometric performance of ARCSHS alleviated key surface quality limitations common in other FTS designs. The common optical path of the instrument also enhances its stability against mechanical and thermal shift. Additional advances in coarse ruling, high-order gratings have eliminated previous issues that prevented ARCSHS designs intended to cover multiple pass bands simultaneously. Finally, advancements in optical fabrication techniques targeting industrial applications have improved optical surface quality, diffraction grating efficiency, and multilayer coating reflectance across the EUV spectral range. These factors combine to provide a very credible path toward the development of SHS at wavelengths into the EUV.* [Advancing Nanomotion Sensor Technology to Provide Evidence for Active Life in Ocean Worlds](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dg6w-bnfu) - One of the most pressing issues of ocean world exploration is the search for life. In this search, it could be argued that multiple lines of evidence are needed to build a case leading to the ultimate potential claim that life, indeed exists, or perhaps, existed in the past, on the planetary body or moon of interest. Thus, instrumentation is required to detect not only the molecular makeup of life based on chemistry, but also to provide evidence of morphological features of putative biological entities and to look for evidence of activity. Of these three, integrated layers of scientific information potentially working together to depict life, detecting activity is perhaps the most challenging. We propose a device that detects life in a chemistry independent manner. This apparatus uses a sensor that monitors nanometric scale motion to characterize living organisms. The device is inspired from atomic force microscopy (AFM) technology and consists of a 100 to 200 micometer long cantilever (sensor) and a motion detection system (laser and a multi-segment photodiode). Even the slightest movements of cells on the cantilever induce oscillations that modify the laser reflection angle and these movements are recorded. This very basic, and chemistry independent, life detection method was successfully tested on dozens of different bacteria types (motile and immobile, gram positive and negative, fast and slowly growing), and eukaryotic cells with always the same result - living organisms induce cantilever oscillations that stop when the organism dies. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the oscillations not only reflect the dead/live state of the studied organism but also its metabolic state through collaboration with a team that uses these devices to rapidly assess bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics (in minutes instead of days or weeks as it is the case with traditional techniques). We are proposing to advance the technology in an ocean world-compatible framework so that it can become a potentially invaluable instrument of choice for life detection in Ocean Worlds targeted missions. Due to its intrinsic simplicity, light weight and chemistry independent operational principle we are convinced that this apparatus is well adapted to detect yet unknown life forms in extreme environments and fits well in the frame of the COLDTech program.

There are six priority technology development activities we are proposing:

1. Develop prototype microfluidic systems and a sample collection system that can be automated for operations compatible with spacecraft science.

2. Design and develop nanomotion detector prototype to be compatible with an optical microscope.

3. Design strategy, concept and operation requirements for a dual function nanomotion detection-AFM imaging instrument.

4. Evaluate sample adhesion substances, determine optimal cellular-inactivation agents and experimental conditions.

5. Demonstrate life detection sensitivities with extremophile organisms and samples.

6. Ocean worlds analogue validation of protoype 2nd generation instrument.

Together, this suite of technological advancements developed by teams from USA, Switzerland and Belgium positions nanomotion detection technology to be spacecraft compatible for ocean world life detection to support near term missions to ocean worlds. In addition, the design of a dual function life detection system which can both image samples and detect nanomotion may be invaluable for spaceflight optimization. The proposed effort will lead to an instrument that will provide evidence for the activity of life, compatible, but distinct from chemistry or microscopy-based approaches. Proof of concept science has demonstrated that this is a highly sensitive technology, and through the work proposed, this instrumentation will meet NASA’s TRL level goals and be flight compatible in terms of specifications set out for light-weight payload missions, such as the Europa Lander.* [Millimeter-wave spectrometer for chirality and relative abundance determination of amino acid biomarkers](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hthd-cseq) - The search for life is a high-priority science objective in the 2013 Decadal Survey paper Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013–2022. The paper recommends (page 240) “a detailed characterization of organics to search for signatures of biological origin, such as molecules with a preferred chirality or unusual patterns of molecular weights” as a key future investigation for determining the possibility of life beyond Earth. While mass spectrometry has often been proposed for measuring the abundance patterns of molecular weights, it lacks the chirality detection capability required for chiral analyses of chiral molecules such as amino acids, and cannot uniquely identify specific structure-based isomers such as fatty acids. Current chirality detection technologies all involve complicated sample isolation and/or chemical derivatization processes.
The novel millimeter-wave chirality detection spectrometer (ChiralSpec) advances key technologies to enable chirality detection and discrimination of structural isomers with a simple instrument. ChiralSpec is applicable to mission focus areas such as Enceladus, Europa, Titan, and Mars. It could be used on planetary in-situ probes to measure amino acids, fatty acids, and other organic molecules in the gas phase or brought into the gas phase. Two of the unique advantages of ChiralSpec are (1) it can analyze the mixture of gases without separating them first; and (2) it has an extraordinary capability for distinguishing isomers.
ChiralSpec employs an innovative microwave three-wave mixing technology for chirality detection and the cavity resonance technology for sensitivity enhancement. ChiralSpec can be operated under two modes: (1) survey mode, with the instrument acting as a traditional microwave spectrometer to characterize chemical composition and quantify abundance of planetary samples; and (2) chirality detection mode, with the instrument determining which enantiomer is in excess and how much it is in excess for each existing chiral molecule.
ChiralSpec contains two parts: a polarized pulsing transmitter and receiver system, and a three-axis resonator chamber. We will design ChiralSpec covering the 75–215 GHz region and perform chirality experiments first with a volatile chiral molecule propylene oxide at room temperature, and then with an nonvolatile amino acid—alanine—at 77 K. Our implementation develops and demonstrates ChiralSpec measurement technologies in the millimeter-wave region:

(1) Design and fabricate the polarized pulsing transmitter and receiver system

(2) Design and fabricate the three-axis resonator chamber

(3) Integrate the pulsing system and the resonator chamber

(4) Perform laboratory chirality experiments to demonstrate ChiralSpec’s sensitivity.
ChiralSpec has entry TRL2 and exit TRL3. The period of performance is 3 years with a start in CY2017.* [CERES Bidirectional Scans Aqua FM3 Edition4](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6rcc-bwt7) - The Edition4 CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) for Flight Model 3 (FM3) on the Aqua spacecraft (CER_BDS_Aqua-FM3_Edition4) data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.

The BDS contains Level-0 raw (unconverted) science and instrument data as well as the geolocated converted science and instrument data. The BDS contains additional data not found in the Level-0 input file, including converted satellite position and velocity data, celestial data, converted digital status data, and parameters used in the radiance count conversion equations. CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002. The newest CERES instrument (FM5) was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011.* [Sulfates, Clouds and Radiation America NASA ER-2 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Airborne Simulator (MAS) Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vu4u-itaz) - SCAR_A_ER2_MAS data are Sulfates, Clouds and Radiation America (SCARA) NASA ER2 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Airborne Simulator (MAS) Data in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF).Smoke/Sulfates, Clouds and Radiation - America (SCAR-A) data include physical and chemical components of the Earth's surface, the atmosphere and the radiation field collected in the eastern part of the United States with an emphasis in air pollution.The primary objective of the SCAR-A experiment was to help scientists characterize the the relationship between sulfate particles and clouds' reflective properties. Sulfate aerosols are believed to provide condensation nuclei, resulting in smaller, more numerous droplets within a cloud. SCAR-A was the first in a series of experiments. It was was followed by the SCAR-C experiment conducted over California in 1994. A third experiment, SCAR-B was conducted in Brazil during August and September 1995. The MODIS Airbourne Simulator (MAS) is a modified Daedalus Wildfire scanning spectrometer which flies on a NASA ER-2 and provides spectral information similar to that provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), launched on Terra (EOS AM-1) in 1999 and Aqua (EOS PM-1) in 2002. The MAS spectrometer acquires high spatial resolution imagery in the wavelength range of 0.55 to 14.3 microns. A total of 50 spectral bands are available in this range, and the digitizer can be configured to collect data from any 12 of these bands. The digitizer was configured with four 10-bit channels and seven 8-bit channels. The MAS spectrometer was mated to a scanner subassembly which collected image data with an IFOV of 2.5 mrad, giving a ground resolution of 50 meters from 20000 meters altitude, and a cross track scan width of 85.92 degrees. The data granules were written using the self documenting file storage format provided through the netCDF interface routines included in the HDF libraries.* [Standoff Ultra-Compact Raman system Development for faster daytime mineralogy and Raman Imaging](https://data.nasa.gov/d/juub-84ff) - Raman spectroscopy can positively identify organic molecules, biomarkers, biominerals, water, water containing minerals, and minerals that are of high interest to NASA and directly serve the goal of finding evidence for past life on Mars and other planets. Micro-Raman systems are capable of performing fine-scale mineralogy; hence, they are being actively proposed as instruments on planetary rovers for in situ analysis. Most of the micro-Raman systems for planetary exploration are implementation of traditional Raman technology that is designed for dark laboratory use. These Raman systems have the following characteristics (1) they require sample collection, (2) they will require shielding of daylight background radiation. In addition, presence of mineral and biological luminescence significantly affect the Raman signal. Due to the use of continuous wave (CW) lasers and non-time gating detection approach, it will also be difficult to distinguish the biofluorescence from the mineral phosphorescence. These limitations will significantly lower the science return from these micro-Raman systems in terms of number and variety of samples that can be analyzed on Mars.
Under this proposal, we propose to develop an innovative “Standoff Ultra-Compact Raman” (SUCR) instrument in collaboration with the University of Hawaii, which will use the superior pulsed time gated Raman technology capable of operating in daylight while minimizing contribution from mineral phosphorescence. SUCR will provide a superior micro-Raman instrument for future NASA missions. The development of SUCR will require improvements in both remote Raman and ultra-compact Raman technologies and the implementation of line imaging for faster Raman context imaging and map collection. The SUCR system will be able to quickly collect (1 s/spectrum) high quality in situ Raman spectral images in the daytime, from distances of several centimeters, with no need for samples collection. For example, the SUCR instrument will allow for fine scale context mineralogy of drilled cores, layer structures, and trenches. In addition, SUCR will be able to detect any micron size biomarker in situ with its faster search and scan mode (0.1s). Furthermore, we will demonstrate that SUCR can be used to detect the past life forms, to utilize fluorescence to distinguish biological from non-biological sources, and to show the system improvement with respect to existing systems. Under this project, the TRL of the proposed SUCR instrument will advance from TRL 2 to TRL 4.* [Accurate Strength & Life Prediction](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qqhn-shaz) - The Accurate Strength & Life Prediction challenge develops validated strength and life prediction tools with known accuracy for complex composite structures and standardized procedures for their reliable use.* [CERES Bidirectional Scans TRMM Edition1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i37v-vgrq) - CER_BDS_TRMM-PFM_Edition1 data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.Each Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data product contains twenty-four hours of Level-1b data for each CERES scanner instrument mounted on each spacecraft.

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solves these dual problems at once. SLAM does not depend on any kind of infrastructure and is thus a promising localization technology for NASA planetary missions and for many terrestrial applications as well. However, state-of-the-art SLAM depends on easily-recognizable landmarks in the robot's environment, which are lacking in barren planetary surfaces. Our work will develop a technology we call MeshSLAM, which constructs robust landmarks from associations of weak features extracted from terrain. Our test results will also show that MeshSLAM applies to all environments in which NASA's rovers could someday operate: dunes, rocky plains, overhangs, cliff faces, and underground structures such as lava tubes. Another limitation of SLAM for planetary missions is its significant data-association problems. As a robot travels it must infer its motion from the sensor data it collects, which invariably suffers from drift due to random error. To correct drift, SLAM recognize when the robot has returned to a previously-visited place, which requires searching over a great deal of previously-sensed data. Computation on such a large amount of memory may be infeasible on space-relevant hardware. MeshSLAM eases these requirements. It employs topology-based map segmentation, which limits the scope of a search. Furthermore, a faster, multi-resolution search is performed over the topological graph of observations. Mesh Robotics LLC and Carnegie Mellon University have formed a partnership to commercially develop MeshSLAM. MeshSLAM technology will be available via open source, to ease its adoption by NASA. In Phase 1 of our project we will show the feasibility of MeshSLAM for NASA and commercial applications through a series of focused technical demonstrations.* [Measurement and Assessment of Flow Quality in Wind Tunnels, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uefv-qkxe) - With increased commercial competition, great pressure is being applied to effect aerodynamic design changes that will improve fuel economy and performance. But, for example, as we are now concerned with small changes in drag count, potential sources of improvement are much more likely to be masked by poor flow quality.  We may have reached the stage where the lack of suitable facility flow quality will hinder and dictate the rate of progress of ground based testing.  Few measurements have been made in the Nation's wind tunnels, and in those cases, large discrepancies have been found between full-scale and predicted performance.  Consequently, there is an urgent need for in-situ measurements to measure flow quality and the performance of turbulence and noise suppression devices.  To meet these challenges, a unique research program is proposed to clarify and alleviate the aerodynamic problems associated with adverse wind tunnel flow quality.  It combines innovative advances in data base assessment and management, and new approaches to turbulence instrumentation and analysis.  Standardized turbulence measurement techniques and data analysis procedures will be established and used to document the flow quality in our major test facilities.* [Measurement and Assessment of Flow Quality in Wind Tunnels, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/eaev-rahe) - New wind tunnel flow quality test and analysis procedures have been developed and will be used to establish standardized turbulent flow quality measurement techniques and data reduction procedures for future flow quality studies in the National Transonic Wind Tunnel (NTF) and other Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) facilities.  To date, few measurements have been made of the characteristics of freestream turbulence in transonic wind tunnels, and details of the amplitude and spectra of freestream velocity and pressure fluctuations is lacking.  Consequently, there is an urgent need for in-situ measurements to determine flow quality and the performance of turbulence and noise suppression devices. This information is required if we are to accurately assess and characterize ground test facility performance. To meet these challenges, a unique research program is proposed to clarify and alleviate the aerodynamic problems associated with adverse wind tunnel flow quality.  It combines innovative advances in data base assessment and management, and new approaches to turbulence instrumentation and analysis.  Standardized turbulence measurement techniques and data analysis procedures will be established and used to document the flow quality in our major test facilities.* [Validation of the NSBRI Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification (ASTRO-CHARM) Integrated Cardiovascular Risk Calculator](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cier-qh9e) - In 2012, the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) supported the development of an integrated tool, termed the Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification (ASTRO-CHARM) Integrated Cardiovascular Risk Calculator. The initial version of this tool was delivered to NSBRI in February of 2014 and has already been implemented in spaceflight on an ad hoc basis. This project seeks to update and validate the ASTRO-CHARM calculator.     <p></p>
Specific Aim 1: To refine the ASTROCHARM tool using extended cardiovascular (CV) event data. Version 1 of the ASTROCHARM tool comprised 6782 subjects with a 159 CV events over a mean follow up of 7.5 years. Both the Dallas Heart Study (DHS) and Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) have now extended their CV event follow up to 10 years. Given the younger age of the cohort and resultant lower event rates, enhancing the endpoint numbers will provide more stability and accuracy for the updated risk score model (ASTRO-CHARM version 2.0).     <p></p>
Specific Aim 2: To validate the ASTROCHARM tool using the Framingham Heart Study coronary artery calcium (CAC) cohort. The ASTRO-CHARM tool demonstrated robust measures of internal validity when assessed in the original combined cohort. These included accurate event rate calibration, as well as improvement in the c-statistic and clinical risk reclassification compared with traditional risk factors alone. However, external validation in another cohort is essential before broader implementation. The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is the highly regarded original large U.S.-based population-based cohort, where CV risk scores originated. A cohort of the FHS underwent CAC scanning including 2740 subjects <65 years of age, with a mean 8 years of CV event follow up data, and is an ideal study in which to validate the ASTRO-CHARM model.     <p></p>
Specific Aim 3: To develop a mobile device application to facilitate broad implementation of the ASTRO-CHARM tool. The near universal availability of mobile technologies has enabled broader use of more sophisticated risk scores. Prior versions such as the Framingham Risk Score initially used tabular formats and adding of integer points, and were infrequently utilized in clinical practice. The Pooled Cohort Equation as part of the New 2013 ACC/AHA (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association) Cholesterol Guidelines has witnessed brisk uptake of a more complex algorithm, partly due to a well-received mobile app that has witnessed more than 64,000 downloads in its first two months.Once validated, a similar tool developed for the ASTROCHARM will greatly enhance its clinical impact.     <p></p>
ASTROCHARM Version 2. The investigators have extended endpoint data to include another 145 events (304 total), with a median follow up of 10.9 years. They have used these expanded endpoints to refine the ASTRO-CHARM calculator and assessed measures of internal validity of the new calculator including discrimination and calibration which were all robust. They applied the ASTRO-CHARM model to the Framingham Heart Study CAC cohort (n=2057). The ASTRO-CHARM calculator showed good discrimination (c-statistic 0.79) and calibration (Goodness-of-Fit Chi-square: 13.2, p=0.16) in the Framingham study. The authors developed a prototype iPhone app for the ASTRO-CHARM and demonstrated this tool to NASA/NSBRI in late July of 2016. They are preparing the manuscript for scientific publication and the app for broad dissemination for NASA/NSBRI and terrestrial medicine applications. <p></p>* [SMEX03 Airborne GPS Bistatic Radar Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j7gx-bipf) - This data set contains measurements of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals reflected from the Earths surface and collected on an airborne platform. The measurements were taken over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) regional study areas of Brazil and Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA. The primary objective was to collect land reflections for sensitivity of the reflected GPS power to temporal and spatial soil moisture and foliage attenuation. The measurements are a form of bistatic radar and can be used to estimate the surface scattering coefficient, such as roughness and/or dielectric properties, as well as path delays between the direct and reflected GPS signals. Scattering coefficients can then be used to estimate changes in surface soil moisture. The reflections collected were from agricultural land in Brazil, Alabama, and Georgia, along with grassland in Oklahoma. Data were collected on 24, 25, 27, 30 June 2003 and 2, 3, 5, 7, 12-15, 17, 18 July 2003.

These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.* [Microwave Detection of Laser Ultrasonic for Non-Destructive Testing, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/frt9-dyav) - In this proposal, we describe a program to demonstrate the technical
feasibility of a high-performance, cost-effective and robust microwave
receiver for the detection of laser-generated ultrasound for NDE. Our
innovative receiver is based on the integration of a microwave
interferometer coupled with a pulsed laser to generate the ultrasound.
By using a microwave interferometer design we will be able to overcome
the limitation generally associated with classical optical receiver: 1)
Inability to work in harsh environment where thermal and mechanical
perturbations are present; 2) Reduction in sensitivity caused by the
speckle nature of the light reflected from rough surfaces; 3) High
system cost due the price of the different lasers, optics and
engineering to develop an optical system working in a harsh environment
and 4) high maintenance cost (Lasers and optics need to be checked,
maintained and re-aligned frequently).* [SMEX03 Two-Dimensional Synthetic Aperture Radiometer (2D-STAR) Brightness Temperatures, Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uu2f-vask) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.

An aircraft carrying the instrument was flown over Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma USA on various dates from 25 June to 15 July 2003 as part of the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03). The 2D-STAR is a research instrument developed under the NASA Instrument Incubator Program with an aim to demonstrate the capability of the two-dimensional aperture synthesis radiometer at low frequency (approximately 1.4 GHz) to observe surface variables such as soil moisture and ocean salinity.

Modern spacecraft payloads demand high throughput while maintaining extremely high levels of reliability and fault tolerance.  Currently, no standardized protocols presently offer space-level products that provide gigabit-class throughputs.  One-off protocols have many drawbacks including long development times, high potential for error, a lack of existing materials, and do not lend themselves to easy prototyping since COTS products are unavailable.   

These chips will retain the power of using the Ethernet standard but will be extended in an innovative way that will allow data rates up to 8 Gbps per port but will still be compatible with ground hardware for development purposes.  Through automated fault monitoring the PHY chip will be automatically detect link failures and the only adverse effect will be a reduction in throughput.* [Ultra-low Noise, High Bandwidth, 1550nm HgCdTe APD, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6uwx-xv6g) - To meet the demands of future high-capacity free space optical communications links, a high bandwidth, near infrared (NIR), single photon sensitive optoelectronic receiver will be designed, manufactured, and demonstrated. The unique vertical charge transport electron avalanche photodiode (EAPD) exploits the bandgap properties of HgCdTe to achieve high quantum efficiency and avalanche multiplication that preferentially ionizes electrons to achieve nearly noiseless gain exceeding 1000 with an excess noise factor approaching 1.0 and bandwidths greater than 500 MHz. In Phase II, a segmented 1 mm x 1 mm back-illuminated detector will be integrated with a low noise CMOS integrated circuit to realize a photoreceiver capable of both single photon detection and photon number discrimination. Unlike Geiger Mode detectors, the receiver can operate at 77K, without the limitations of afterpulsing, so that dark current can de reduced and bit errors rates reduced. A cold laser line filter is used to select the spectral response anywhere within the 1064-2400 nm spectral band. 

Optical communications has been identified as a critical technology for future NASA missions, and the innovation satisfied the currently unmet need for a single photon sensitive, large area, high bandwidth NIR photoreceivers that is not served by contemporary approaches.* [Construction of Predictive Uncertainty Quantification Framework to the Extrapolation of TPS Arc-Jet Experiment Data to Flight Conditions](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ji4v-phaj) - Objective 1.1 of the 2014 Strategic Plan states that NASA's efforts will continue to be to "Expand human presence into the solar system and to the surface of Mars to advance exploration, science, innovation, benefits to humanity, and international collaboration." Although NASA's safe delivery of the Curiosity rover to the surface of Mars proved the organization's ability to transport unmanned cargo, significant progress must be made prior to accomplishing the same feat with human astronauts onboard. Namely the understanding of the physical processes and ability to protect the space vehicle from the harsh conditions encountered in hypersonic atmosphere entries must be expanded upon. Researchers depend on computational models and ground facility scale tests to study the performance of thermal protection systems [TPS] that protect space vehicles from the high temperature gases involved. However, the conditions reproduced at current complexes such as plasma flow wind tunnels cannot match simultaneously all of the actual flight conditions. More importantly, the aerothermal environment on the entire vehicle cannot be reproduced. It can only be approximated at few points such as the stagnation line. The need for proper uncertainty quantification and propagation of, including but not limited to, epistemic uncertainty of systems is outlined in section 11.3.6 of TA-11 as well as validation of modeling tools in section 11.3.8.1 of TA-11. The proposed work focuses on the development of a stochastic model for enhancing the ability to extrapolate arc-jet facility TPS data to flight conditions as well as validation and uncertainty quantification through Bayesian methods. It has been shown that even for small probes, radiative heating constitutes 10% of the total heat flux [Chazot]. However, current plasma flow wind tunnel methodologies are unable to reproduce the effects of the radiative processes or the Mach number of the flow experienced in hypersonic Mars return atmosphere entries. By applying a stochastic model to arc-jet facility data that accounts for the inability to recreate all flight conditions at the stagnation point, and propagation and quantification of uncertainty of the system, the confidence with which the results can be extrapolated will be increased and limitations made known. The statistical approach to model validation will be tested using EFT1 flight data. The construction of the stochastic model and planned uncertainty quantification and validation treatments will help increase the compatibility of ground facility results with flight conditions.* [Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q2x7-9u78) - Given the extended duration of future missions and the isolated, extreme and confined environments, there is the possibility that behavioral conditions and mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) will develop. The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool that unobtrusively integrates all available behavioral measures collected during a mission to provide a dashboard of behavioral health indicators. These indicators will be placed within the context of quantitatively-tracked mission stressors to provide meaningful feedback allowing behavioral issues to be detected and mitigated at an early stage. The result of this project will be a system prototype that can be deployed in space analog environments (e.g., Mars 520 study, Antarctica) for validation testing and ultimately deployed in long-duration space exploration missions. The critical need for an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP Integrated Research Plan (July 2009) gap BMED3. Phase II will achieve: (1) an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitor software interface; (2) a data integration system; (3) a trend and change detection algorithm; and (4) a countermeasure selection aid. The Technology Readiness Level at the end of Phase II will be TRL 6.* [Feasibility Study of a Magnetic Suspension System for Testing the Dynamic Stability of Blunt Bodies in NASA GRC’s 225 square centimeter Supersonic Wind Tunnel](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jyc5-fdkn) - The dynamic stability of blunt bodies during planetary entry is difficult to quantify as computational methods have yet to demonstrate accurate predictive capabilities and experimental methods cannot explicitly measure damping derivatives. Ballistic range testing has been used in the past to determine dynamic behavior of blunt body vehicles by firing test models down a test range from a gun at low supersonic Mach numbers. Photographs are taken of the test model during flight to monitor the capsule's position and angle. A 6-degree of freedom simulation is then fit to the data points captured by the photos and the capsule aerodynamics are returned. This method is an imperfect test set-up as the uniformity of conditions throughout the test range and the initial release state is variable. In addition, the primary test range used to capture data for the MSL entry vehicle, Eglin Air Force Base, was recently decommissioned.

The aim of this project is to conduct a feasibility study in order to determine design requirements for a magnetic suspension system in the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) 225 square centimeter Supersonic Wind Tunnel. This much-needed alternate method has the potential to measure damping coefficients more accurately than traditional ballistic range testing and wind tunnel tests with stings. In the proposed experimental set-up, a magnetic suspension system will balance the aerodynamic, gravitational and magnetic forces so the free-to-oscillate model is held in the test section. High-speed cameras will capture the model's position and angle of attack over time and a trajectory will be fit to these data points, much like ballistic range testing.

Although magnetic suspension has been used in the past, the proposed system will be a new, innovative implementation of this technology. Blunt body models have never been tested using magnetic suspension and a completely new positioning system will have to be designed, making this project a challenging design problem. The blunt body test models will comprise a non-magnetic material surrounding a spherical iron core. The geometry of the test model itself places a size limitation on the spherical iron core so the suspension system will have to be powerful enough to overcome this constraint.

Initial design questions regarding system implementation will be analyzed and answered by assessing problems in the wind tunnel operation, the magnetic suspension system and the design of the model. These problems will be evaluated using MATLAB for simulation purposes and wind tunnel tests. The main design questions to be answered include determining the lowest possible operating dynamic pressure so minimize the force on the magnet through a wind tunnel test, defining the allowable size of the model to avoid blockage but to provide enough magnetic force, and finally resolving the physical constraints of necessary visual and maintenance access despite a potentially massive magnetic suspension system surrounding the tunnel.

This project is important because a deep understanding of the behavior of capsules during entry is necessary for trajectory analysis as well as the safety of robotic or human missions. Magnetic suspension would allow for inexpensive testing of blunt body capsules so that dynamic aerodynamics coefficients can be determined to an improved or similar degree of accuracy as ballistic range testing. This project would serve to answer design questions that would be used to create an extremely beneficial modeling tool in the GRC 225 square centimeter tunnel as well as open the door to impactful innovations in magnetic suspension.* [Radiation Pressure on Tunable Optical Metamaterials for Propulsion and Steering without Moving Parts](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cjgq-yzyu) - Just as wind can exert a pressure on a sail to propel a sailboat, light too can exert a pressure on a reflective object. This radiation pressure can be used to propel small spacecrafts and is the working principle behind solar sails. However, in order to steer the craft, movable mechanical structures are usually needed, which is a major limitation due to added bulk and weight. In contrast to these traditional solar sails, we will use of a thin film optical metamaterial, composed of sub-wavelength resonant structures, which is capable of changing, in real-time, the optical properties of the device locally. This allows for active control of the resulting photon pressure and hence the ability to steer without the need for mechanically movable parts. In addition, by measuring the photon pressure, we will further illuminate the true nature of photon momentum—a controversy dating back to the early 1900s. We will determine the frequency dependence of the radiation pressure on a variety of materials (traditional dielectrics, traditional metals, and nano- and micro-structured metamaterials) using a cantilever-based setup.* [CER_BDS_Aqua-FM4_Edition1-CV](https://data.nasa.gov/d/734f-iji2) - CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data in HDF.* [CER_BDS_Terra-FM1_Edition4](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pwwz-g739) - The Edition4 CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) for Flight Model 1 (FM1) on the Terra spacecraft (CER_BDS_Terra-FM1_Edition4) data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.

of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence
of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation
retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals
from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial
coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument
are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.

Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the
retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and
index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information,
unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is
advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model
data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).

The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution
(regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation
estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database
provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.* [GPM PR on TRMM Reflectivity, Precipitation Statistics, Histograms, at Surface and Fixed Heights, 1 month 5x5 and 0.25x0.25 degree V06 (GPM_3PR) at GES DISC](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nng4-6n3c) - Version 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.

This is the GPM-like formatted TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) monthly gridded data, first released with the "V8" TRMM reprocessing. The TRMM radar Level 3 grids are now consistent with the GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). The closest ancestor of this dataset was the monthly radar statistics 3A25.

This product consists of monthly statistics of the PR measurements at 0.25x0.25 degrees, and monthly histograms and statistics at 5x5 degrees, horizontal resolution.

The objective of the algorithm is to calculate various daily statistics from the level 2 PR
output products. Four types of statistics are calculated:
1. Probabilities of occurrence (count values)
2. Means and standard deviations
3. Histograms
4. Correlation coefficients
In all cases, the statistics are conditioned on the presence of rain or some other quantity such
as the presence of stratiform rain or the presence of a bright-band. For example, to compute
the unconditioned mean rain rate, the conditional mean must be multiplied by the probability
of rain which, in turn is calculated from the ratio of rain counts to the total number of
observations in the box of interest.

The grids are in the Planetary Grid 2 structure matching the Dual-frequency PR on the core GPM observatory that covers 67S to 67N degrees of latitudes. The low resolution 5x5 deg grid covers 70S to 70N. Areas beyond the ±40 degrees of latitudes are padded with empty grid cells.* [CER_BDS_Terra-FM2_Edition4](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mq7u-zbym) - The Edition4 CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) for Flight Model 2 (FM2) on the Terra spacecraft (CER_BDS_Terra-FM2_Edition4) data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.

The Ares I-X Ground Diagnostic Prototype demonstrated anomaly detection, fault detection, fault isolation, and diagnostics for the Ares I-X first-stage Thrust Vector Control and for the associated ground hydraulics while the vehicle was in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and while it was on the launch pad. The prototype combines three existing tools. The first tool, TEAMS (Testability Engineering and Maintenance System), is a model-based tool from Qualtech Systems Inc. for fault isolation and diagnostics. The second tool, SHINE (Spacecraft Health Inference Engine), is a rule-based expert system that was developed at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We developed SHINE rules for fault detection and mode identification, and used the outputs of SHINE as inputs to TEAMS. The third tool, IMS (Inductive Monitoring System), is an anomaly detection tool that was developed at NASA Ames Research Center. The three tools were integrated and deployed to KSC, where they were interfaced with live data. This paper describes how the prototype performed during the period before the launch, including accuracy and computer resource usage. The paper concludes with some of the lessons that we learned from the experience of developing and deploying the prototype.* [Comparison of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Methods](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gp8b-j5x2) - Several different unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been applied to Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) data to serve the purpose of developing a comprehensive suite of Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) tools. As the theoretical bases for these methods vary considerably, it is reasonable to conjecture that the resulting anomalies detected by them may differ quite significantly as well. As such, it would be useful to apply a common metric with which to compare the results. However, for such a quantitative analysis to be statistically significant, a sufficient number of examples of both nominally categorized and anomalous data must be available. Due to the lack of sufficient examples of anomalous data, use of any statistics that rely upon a statistically significant sample of anomalous data is infeasible. Therefore, the main focus of this paper will be to compare actual examples of anomalies detected by the algorithms via the sensors in which they appear, as well the times at which they appear. We find that there is enough overlap in detection of the anomalies among all of the different algorithms tested in order for them to corroborate the severity of these anomalies. In certain cases, the severity of these anomalies is supported by their categorization as failures by experts, with realistic physical explanations. For those anomalies that can not be corroborated by at least one other method, this overlap says less about the severity of the anomaly, and more about their technical nuances, which will also be discussed.* [SMEX03 Vegetation Data: Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nzqf-4hyv) - This data set includes data collected over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) area of northern Alabama, USA between 22 June and 1 July 2003. The parameters measured were plant height, plant stand density, phenology, wet biomass, dry biomass, row spacing, and row direction. Data were collected at crop, pasture, and forested sites. Those sites are part of the Alabama MesoNet (ALMNet), which is run by Alabama A&M University's Center for Hydrology, Soil Climatology and Remote Sensing (HSCaRS). Data are provided in an ASCII text file and a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and are available via FTP.

These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Ultra-Rapid Earth Rotation Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tjrv-s8r2) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Ultra-Rapid Earth Rotation Product (ERP) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure.  Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce GNSS Earth Rotation products. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS ultra-rapid combined ERP products. The ultra-rapid ERP combination is a sub-daily solution, released four times per day, at 03:00, 09:00, 15:00, and 21:00 UTC (prior to GPS week 1267 they were released twice daily). IGS ultra-rapid ERP files are to be used with the IGS ultra-rapid orbit solution files. All ERP solution files utilize the IGS ERP format.* [High-Density Diffraction Imaging and Non-Imaging Grating Elements for EUV and X-ray Spectroscopy Fabricated by DUV Reduction Photolithography, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bgfe-6rv3) - There is a need for lightweight high-density (4000+ lines/mm) novel diffraction grating elements in modern telescopes to advance EUV and X-ray astrophysics.

In response to NASA request, we propose to apply state-of-the art DUV reduction photolithographic tools developed for modern semiconductor industry and LightSmyth's proven design expertise in the application of this technology to the development of grating devices with constant and varying line spacing (VLS).  The proposal will focus on four major areas:  
(i) Development and demonstration of constant and VLS reflective diffraction grating elements for EUV and X-ray spectroscopy at glazing angle of incidence with straight lines. 
(ii) Development and demonstration of VLS reflective diffraction grating elements for EUV and X-ray spectroscopy at glazing angle of incidence with curved lines to produce focusing diffraction grating elements on a plane substrate. 
(iii) Design of in-plane and off-plane reflective diffraction grating elements for NASA's Constellation-X.

The algorithm will be capable of operating when measurement data is available on an intermittent basis.  An FDI algorithm for faults in the three translational and rotational modes of 4 satellites flying in formation in a highly elliptical orbit will be designed during the Phase 1 effort.  The satellites will carry a limited suite of instruments, just sufficient to determine faults in the three translational and rotational modes and include a GPS receiver.  Communication with a ground station will only be available near perigee.  The measurement data is not stored and transmitted in bursts, so these communication blackouts represent a break in the time history of measurements.  The proposed development will mitigate these breaks so that fault detection and isolation can be performed faster than in a simple, cyclical restart implementation.  Furthermore, their elliptical orbit will carry the satellites beyond the GPS constellation.  The proposed development will account for the loss of GPS coverage as well investigate ways of extending the useful of GPS (when signals are weak) for fault detection and isolation.* [Multi-Fidelity Multi-Strategy and Multi-Disciplinary Design Optimization Environment, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sqyp-pvta) - Multidisciplinary design and optimization (MDO) tools developed to perform multi-disciplinary analysis based on low fidelity computation methods have been used in aircraft conceptual design for decades.  These tools have been proven very effective for simple problems and mostly have been developed as a single codes.  However, as analyses have become more complex and the need to consider more design factors crucial, such codes have grown so large as to be inconceivable and difficult to maintain.  Nowadays, the design optimization process of a modern airplane must account for all failure modes and behavior constraints.  In addition, it should cover manufacturing constraints and limitations on available resources, such as power, weight, and cost, simultaneously.  This has to be done in an integrated way, so that the effects of any change in the design on all constraints and behavior measures are accurately modeled, and all interactions and trade-offs among design variables and disciplines are allowed to affect the design.
ZONA Technology (ZONA) and its team member (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University), hereinafter referred to as "the ZONA team", propose in Phase I to develop a multi-fidelity, multi-strategy and multi-disciplinary design optimization environment, called the M3 Design Optimization Environment (M3 DOE) that consists of a three-layer optimization strategy, a multi-fidelity aerodynamic discipline, and a finite element analysis including outer mold line morphing and topology re-meshing capability.  The M3 DOE allows the designer to select an appropriate optimization strategy and an aerodynamic method with an appropriate fidelity to obtain an optimum design with desired accuracy within the allowable time constraint.* [Comparative Analysis of Data-Driven Anomaly Detection Methods](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ydqx-nujt) - This paper provides a review of three different advanced machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection in continuous data streams from a ground-test firing of a subscale Solid Rocket Motor (SRM).

We measure the performance of the algorithm with respect to the detection horizon for situations where fault information is available. These algorithms have been also studied by the present authors (and other co-authors) as applied to liquid propulsion systems. The trade space will be explored between these algorithms for both types of propulsion systems.* [Non-Destructive Detection and Separation of Radiation Damaged Cells in Miniaturized, Inexpensive Device, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sg2y-93dr) - There is a clear and well-identified need for rapid, efficient,
non-destructive detection and isolation of radiation damaged cells.
Available commercial technologies are expensive, require core facilities
and use destructive methods. We propose to develop and demonstrate a
novel fully automated, microfluidics-based device for identification and
sorting of radiation damaged cells.  The final product will be simple,
small, inexpensive and fieldable in research environments as well as
space. We will identify novel cell surface markers indicating radiation
damage using a microarray (gene expression) experiments and verify
downselected markers (protein upregulation) using fluorescent antibody
tagged microparticles. CFDRC's proprietary dielectrophoretic cell sorter
technology will be adapted for automated separation of the tagged
damaged cells from overall population of cells. Proof-of-concept will be
demonstrated by separation of damaged cells from an irradiated cell
sample. Phase II efforts will focus along two primary lines. Surface
biomarkers discovery will be further extended and validated. An
integrated microfluidic cartridge and instrumentation capable of all
operations (storage, mixing, sorting) will be developed.  The prototype
instrument will be demonstrated with both terrestrial and space
radiation (in collaboration with NASA researchers/facilities). A
multi-disciplinary team consisting of experts in microfluidics engineers

Optical radiation monitors provide continuous detection of e- and n.  Radiation induced changes in the optical properties of each sensor's active material are interpreted via software to estimate the dose from each type of particle. Compared to traditional scintillation detectors, Luna's radiation monitors are more compact and better able to identify particle types.  Luna's unique sensor design and detection capabilities enable estimation of the energy and direction of the most energetic particles.  Advanced optical radiation monitors are also less prone to the radiation induced degradation that plagues diode dosimeters.* [An Infrared Fiber-Optic Raman Sensor for Field Detecting of Organic Biomarkers, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yneb-jvue) - The search for organics on Mars remains a key objective for future missions.  However current instruments for detailed organic analysis require complex sample handling and can process only a limited number of samples.  To allow for rapid sample characterization, the in situ non-destructive Raman detection technique is a highly desirable sensing tool for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. However, current Raman systems deployed in the field are inadequate due to deleterious fluorescence interference. Fluorescence is often several orders of magnitude more intense than Raman scattering signals and its broad structures spectrum could be difficult to remove from Raman spectra. We propose to develop a rover-mounted infrared fiber-optic Raman sensor that can eliminate fluorescence with significantly improved Raman sensitivity for fast field detections. The infrared fiber-optic Raman sensor is based on recent technology advances in fiber lasers, fiber optic Raman probes and infrared detector arrays. Innovative infrared fiber-optic Raman sensor enables highly sensitive fluorescence-free Raman analysis and offers flexible remote detection, so that the field spectral sensor's overall performance would be intact and extremely flexible for planetary missions. We will deliver a rover-mounted infrared fiber-optic Raman sensor to NASA at the end of Phase II program.* [Self-Biased Radiation Hardened Ka-Band Circulators for Size, Weight and Power Restricted Long Range Space Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v9ve-4fmv) - Ferrite control components including circulators and isolators are fundamental building blocks of Transmit/Receive modules (TRM) utilized in high data rate active space transceivers and transponders for both long-range (LR) and low earth orbit (LEO) systems. These components are utilized to protect high power amplifiers (HPA) during the transmit cycle from destabilizing, and potentially harmful, power reflections from the antenna element. During receive cycle these components are utilized to direct lower power received signals with minimal attenuation to the low noise amplifiers (LNA). As such, performance specifications of these ferrite control components, such as bandwidth, insertion loss, isolation, power handling, temperature stability, radiation hardness, and linearity impose strict limitations on the overall system performance. Over the course of the proposed Ph1 SBIR program self-biased ferrite control components based on highly textured hexagonal ferrite compacts which have the potential to eliminate biasing magnets and significantly reduce the size, cost, and weight of the TRM while concurrently increasing power handling capability, and improving temperature stability and radiation hardness will be investigated. Specifically, a research and development path to realizing high performance self-biased ferrite materials and device designs for operation in space based environments at Ka-band (>27 GHz, 31.5 - 34 GHz targeted) is outlined.* [Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u9u9-axbr) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI) 

Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation (WASP). Utilizing average monthly precipitation data from 1980 through 2000 at a resolution of 2.5 degrees, WASP assesses the precipitation 

deficit or surplus over a three month temporal window that is weighted by the magnitude of the seasonal cyclic variation in precipitation. The three months' averages are derived from the 

precipitation data and the median rainfall for the 21 year period is calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells where the three month running average of precipitation is less than 1 mm per 

day ae excluded. Drought events are identified when the magnitude of a monthly precipitation deficit is less than or equal to 50 percent of its longterm median value for three or more 

consecutive months. Grid cells are then divided into 10 classes having an approximately equal number of grid cells. Higher grid cell values denote higher frequencies of drought occurrences. 

This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate 

Prediction (IRI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [An Instrument to Measure Aircraft Sulfate Particle Emissions, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/svcs-hyhf) - Aerodyne is developing a sulfate detection instrument, based on the Tunable Infrared Laser Differential Absorption Spectrophotometer (TILDAS) technology and therefore termed the "TILDAS-sulfate" instrument, for measurement of the size-resolved sulfate PM emissions of aircraft engine combustion. Over the past 10 years and through a series of NASA led efforts, the Aerodyne Research Inc emissions team has made a series of contributions to on-going NASA programs to characterize aircraft engine emissions. Despite progress, significant knowledge gaps exist &#150; especially for combustion emissions of alternatives to petroleum jet fuel. During this SBIR effort, we tested instrument performance in the absence of interferences, in the presence of >20-fold excess sulfur dioxide interference, in the presence of a combustion gases containing nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons as potential interferences, and for particles ranging in size from 100 to 300 nm. Instrument sensitivity was shown to be at least 600 ng per meter cubed (on a 1-sec cycle). In Phase II, we plan to: upgrade the instrument and incorporate improvements to Aerodyne's TILDAS technology to improve the detection limit to as low as 60 ng per meter cubed &#150; on a 1-sec data acquisition cycle; test the upgraded instrument in the laboratory; demonstrate the instrument in the field for characterization of aircraft engine particle emissions.* [Poverty Mapping Project: Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2xef-j33m) - The Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition dataset consists of estimates of the

of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence
of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation
retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals
from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial
coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument
are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.

Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the
retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and
index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information,
unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is
advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model
data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).

The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution
(regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation
estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database
provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Final Cumulative Station Positions/Velocities (no covariance matrix) Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cngb-z2u7) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Final Cumulative Station Positions/Velocities (no covariance matrix) Product available from the Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

Astronauts experience gravitational transitions from Earth's gravitational level during launch to microgravity in space, then to partial gravity if landing on the Moon, Mars, or Martian moons, followed by a return to microgravity, and finally re-entry back to Earth. In addition, the use of Artificial Gravity (AG) from an on-board centrifuge also presents an altered gravity challenge, in particular during transitions between gravity levels. During each of these g-transitions astronauts must adapt their sensorimotor programs to coordinate perceptual and motor capabilities and function successfully and safely. The ability to identify and predict changes in sensorimotor function during these g-transitions is essential to the development of protocols and countermeasure implementation for future crew members. This project takes a new approach which could lead to a practical and acceptable protocol. We alter gravito-inertial accelerations with centrifugation in different body orientations. Furthermore, we have quantified sensory adaptation capabilities of both perception and manual control ability to a transition into hypo-gravity. Additionally, we investigated the effect of a common motion sickness drug, promethazine, on basic vestibular motion perception. This is an important step in better understanding the benefits and risks associated with the use of motion sickness drugs in conjunction with adaptation training and in flight after critical gravity transitions.     <p></p>
Specific Aims: The original specific aims for this project were: SA1) Demonstrate that individual differences exist in the ability to adapt to gravitational transitions, and can be measured quantitatively by measures of subjective orientation, closed loop manual control, and subjective motions sickness reports. SA2) Test whether pre-training by adapting to one altered gravity environment can improve sensorimotor adaptation in another altered gravity environment. SA3) Test whether the leading pharmacological agent, promethazine, affects either basic vestibular perceptual function or the adaptation rate to an altered gravity environment and the associated motion sickness symptoms. SA4) Develop and test a combined pre-adaptation training and pharmacological intervention protocol that can both improve sensorimotor adaptation and reduce the associated motion sickness.     <p></p>
Hypotheses: The hypotheses are: H1) Individual differences exist in the ability to adapt to altered gravity environments and these differences can be predicted by measuring adaptability in one altered gravity environment. H2) Pre-adaptation training in one altered gravity environment will improve sensorimotor adaptation in another altered gravity environment. H3) Promethazine will reduce motion sickness, but will have no influence on either basic vestibular perceptual function or sensorimotor adaptation to altered gravity environments.     <p></p>
Results: We determine individual differences in performance of both the perception and manual control tasks in terms of initial performance decrement and adaptation time constant. All subjects consistently show a performance decrement in the perception and closed-loop manual control task on initial exposure to altered-gravity, followed by a return back to baseline performance. Promethazine significantly affects upright roll tilt motion perception thresholds, a measure of basic vestibular perceptual function. Thresholds were not different with promethazine for upright yaw or upright interaural translation motions. However, the small but consistent effect of promethazine on roll tilt perception could have functional and operational significance.     <p></p>
Deliverables: Deliverables are a methodology for measuring an individual's capacity to adapt to an altered gravity environment using affordabl* [Pre-flight Training of Autonomic Responses for Mitigating the Effects of Spatial Disorientation During Spaceflight](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gzts-gszf) - Space motion sickness is characterized by symptoms of spatial disorientation, nausea, and vomiting. It affects approximately 70% of the crew during space travel and symptoms are commonly treated with intramuscular injections of promethazine. However, this countermeasure has had limited effectiveness and produces unwanted side-effects that include drowsiness and impaired performance. This study addresses PRD Risks: Risk of Therapeutic Failure due to Ineffectiveness of Medication; Risk of Impaired Control of Spacecraft, Associated Systems and Immediate Vehicle Egress due to Vestibular/Sensorimotor Alterations Associated with Spaceflight. Integrated Research Plan (IRP) Gap SM11: Can crewmember spatiomotor abilities be more accurately predicted and countermeasures and training techniques developed to mitigate spatial disorientation during spaceflight? The purpose of the proposed research is to evaluate an alternative countermeasure for mitigating symptoms without the side effects commonly observed with anti-motion sickness medications. Autogenic-Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE) is a 6-hour physiological training program that has proven to be a highly efficient and effective method for enabling people to monitor and voluntarily control up to 20 of their own physiological responses, thereby suppressing motion sickness symptoms. In an earlier flight study, three astronauts were given AFTE during preflight training and three other astronauts participated as controls and were given a pharmacologic treatment. Shuttle crews were required to record data during launch, waking hours on mission days 1 to 3, and during reentry. They were required to practice AFTE for 15-minute inflight and apply control if symptoms occurred. Our findings indicate that 2 of the 3 astronauts receiving AFTE were successful at controlling symptoms in flight, while 2 of 3 controls were severely debilitated despite given anti-motion sickness medications.    <p></p>
Specific Objectives: 1) To determine individual baselines of physiological responses and tolerances to spatial disorientation in a rotating chair test simulating the  cross-coupled angular acceleration effects anticipated for Orion space craft re-entry; and 2) To evaluate AFTE effects for mitigating symptoms and improving tolerances to spatial disorientation.     <p></p>
Methods: Establish capability for providing remote AFTE training to any location. The study will include two groups of men and women, 10 subjects per group: Treatment - AFTE and Control no treatment. Each group will receive 4 exposures to rotating chair tests at one week intervals. All subjects will receive training on a manual dexterity and short-term memory task between tests 1 and 2. Subjects in the treatment group will receive a total of 6-hours AFTE training (two hours before the second, third, and fourth tests).     <p></p>
Deliverable: NASA Technical Memorandum and peer-reviewed journal article(s). We anticipate results of this study will demonstrate that AFTE provides crews with significantly better protection from the effects of spatial disorientation than adaptation training alone and without the side-effects of medication, thereby improving health,safety, and operational efficiency. <p></p>* [Chip-Scale Heterodyne Spectrometers for Cubesats and Small Landers](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j8bm-5ryj) - <p>Development of chip-size remote sensors for measuring atmospheric molecules and meteorology on Earth and on other planets. &nbsp;We specifically target usage on future interplanetary small platforms (e.g. smallsats, small landers).</p><p>The chip spectrometer operates on the principle of heterodyne detection. &nbsp;Heterodyne spectrometers offer ultra-high spectral resolution, without bulky dispersive elements or moving parts, and shot-noise-limited SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). &nbsp;Moreover, the chip spectrometer utilizes microfabrication to produce on-chip arrays wherein each array element (pixel) is a heterodyne spectrometer. &nbsp;Depending on the measurement objective, these on-chip nano-spectrometers can be configured either as spatial imaging pixels to enable imaging, or as spectral pixels for increasing spectral coverage. &nbsp;The chip detector resides in the focal plane of a mini-telescope to detect sunlight that has propagated through the planetary atmosphere. &nbsp;Amplitudes of absorption lines observed in the sunlight indicate molecular abundances, while ratios between different rotational-vibrational lines indicate atmospheric temperatures. &nbsp;Additionally, Doppler shifts in line-center wavelengths indicate wind speeds.</p>* [The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development.](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a3s4-zqy3) - Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development and has been proposed as a gravisensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days. Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins chemokines IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules. Importantly 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity. Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs.

Imaging technologies are key to the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions that astronauts on an exploration mission might encounter and to research activities that characterize and understand the adaptations to micro- and partial gravity environments. Key limitations of the currently available imaging capabilities include the complexity and operator dependency of the procedures to acquire high quality results. Currently, two imaging procedures critical to space medicine and research, ultrasound and optical coherence tomography (OCT), are performed on the International Space Station (ISS) by astronauts with the assistance of real-time communication with experts on the ground using a method called remote guidance. With this methodology astronauts have acquired diagnostic and research quality data that are central to our understanding of the physiological consequences of weightlessness, including altered cardiac function, muscle atrophy, and the spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). However, with the time delay in communications that will be inherent in exploration missions while traveling great distances from Earth, remote guidance will no longer be practical, particularly when one-way transmissions may take up to 10 minutes or more. To fill this gap, we developed advanced audio-visual training modules, a form of just-in-time (JIT) training, to acquire medically necessary and research-relevant images. Building on our extensive experience with remote guidance of ISS astronauts and demonstrated success with just-in-time training, we employed an augmented reality (AR) system (Microsoft HoloLens) that included three-dimensional graphics of relevant anatomy, step-by-step audio instruction, reference images demonstrating adequate and inadequate quality, and troubleshooting guides. The ability of untrained subject-operators to acquire high-quality ultrasound and OCT images was evaluated by expert reviewers and compared to current JIT techniques for quality and time efficiency.     <p></p>
Methods     <p></p>
Tutorials to acquire ultrasound and OCT images were adapted for use as a PowerPoint presentation viewed either on a laptop computer or using an augmented reality platform with a heads-up display. Instructional material presented by the two different training modalities was identical, except that the augmented reality tutorial provided additional spatial guidance to complete the scanning protocols. Additional guidance included arrows superimposed on the ultrasound and OCT keyboards when specific controls were needed and virtual green dots superimposed on the body over the ultrasound targets' approximate locations to guide ultrasound probe placement. Twenty subjects attempted to acquire ultrasound and OCT images using the tutorials provided viewed on a laptop computer, and 20 subjects attempted the same diagnostic imaging procedures with instructions viewed using the AR system. No subject had prior experience performing these procedures or using this imaging hardware, and no subject participated in this study as a member of both groups. Subjects used guidance from the tutorials to acquire five ultrasound targets that constitute a subset of images in a trauma-induced injury assessment protocol (images of the heart, lungs, liver, kidney and spleen) and a single thirteen-line, vertical raster scan centered on the macula of the left eye using OCT. Time limits were imposed upon the subjects to acquire each of the ultrasound or OCT targets. This is not dissimilar to the environment on ISS or anticipated on future exploration missions in which communication windows or mission objectives can impact the available time to complete imaging procedures.     <p></p>
After the data collection session, subjects completed a survey to capture their thought about the equipment, procedures, instructional material, and future improvements. Images were stored by the subjects and evaluated off-line in a blind* [FY17 GRC: Shock/Corrosion Proof Bearings for Space Mechanisms](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5p6j-bree) - <p>Space mechanisms often present an unusual set of requirements for tribological components such as bearings. Highly corrosive, extreme temperature, dynamic loading, etc, environmental demands sometimes drive the choice of bearing design and/or material more so than the operational requirements. Frequently, no bearing material or technology exists to satisfy all of the unique requirements of a given space mechanism. The result is that one or more desired capabilities must be compromised (eg. life, power loss, speed).&nbsp;The vision of the proposed effort is&nbsp;to broaden the current capability of bearings through new materials and design practices to eliminate some of these compromises, enabling enhanced current and future mission prospects. A promising class of materials (Nickel Titanium (NiTi) alloys) have been shown to have significant potential for challenging bearing applications requiring high corrosion resistance and/or withstanding large shock loads in addition to the typical rigors of rotating machinery.&nbsp;The goal of this project is to demonstrate shock and corrosion resistant NiTi bearings to address limitations in current space mechanism bearing technology.</p>* [CERES Bidirectional Scans Aqua FM4 Edition4](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nq2g-58t6) - The Edition4 CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) for Flight Model 4 (FM4) on the Aqua spacecraft (CER_BDS_Aqua-FM4_Edition4) data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.

technologies can be time consuming and difficult, with expensive to
over-budget development cycles and longer time-to-deployment. The
proposed Q-Deploy  Processor and FPGA Rapid-Deployment Platform, with
the endorsement of a leading prime who is heavily involved with NASA
programs and allocations, will give NASA a standardized and commercially
available system providing an environment and infrastructure for
accelerated development and rapid deployment of highly reliable
applications on reconfigurable computing platforms.  The Q-Deploy system
will leverage and extend proven reconfigurable software technologies
developed under DOD contracts and promotes the development of reusable
and easily testable functions, with an expanding library of tested
features that address normal system-level functions and requirements.
The existing technologies will be expanded for operation in Triple
Modular Redundancy (TMR) soft-core processors within FPGA(s) to provide
added reliability for applications in environments such as those of
interest to NASA.  This expansion enhances reliability, and when
combined with other capabilities, enables the possibility of, for
example, &quot;replacing&quot; a faulty processor in an operational
system. Reliability will be further enhanced by providing the Hardware
Object Refresh Manager to refresh objects in a managed and prioritized
manner to combat module failures due to, for example, radiation induced
bit swaps without the requirement of device reset or downtime.
Q-Deploy's innovative approach for reliable, rapid development and
deployment of reconfigurable technologies will provide a flexible,
modifiable, and extendable platform usable by multiple developers for
NASA and other organizations.* [GaN Bulk Growth and Epitaxy from Ca-Ga-N Solutions, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/aik7-hupz) - The innovations proposed here are Ka-band (38 GHz) group III-nitride power FETs and the dislocation density reducing epitaxial growth methods (LPE) needed for their optimal performance and reliability.

Ka-band power transistors with >60% Power Added Efficiency (PAE) are not commercially available. The primary limitations to their manufacture are lack of mature process technology at major GaN foundries for sib-100nm lithography necessary for gate definition, and the difficulty of obtaining low dislocation density GaN templates in a suitable wafer size format (3-inch SiC and 6-inch Si) for mass production.  Demonstration of Ka-band operation in the group III-nitrides has, to date, been primarily the realm of academic research labs.  IIIAN's proposal bridges the gap between commercially available nitride foundry capabilities and pure research by utilizing proven process technology at RFMD for processes not requiring deep, submicron lithography and utilizing state-of-the-art nanofabrication technology available at the University of Minnesota's NanoFabrication Center.* [Rapid Hydrogen and Methane Sensors for Wireless Leak Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gn5u-6yrc) - Under NASA STTR NNK07EA39C, ASR&D developed passive surface acoustic wave (SAW) based hydrogen sensors that utilize Pd nanocluster films on self-assembled siloxane monolayers to provide rapid, reversible room temperature responses to hydrogen exposure.  Under NASA SBIR NNX09CE49P ASR&D demonstrated wireless interrogation of SAW RFID sensor-tags.  In this project, we propose to combine the results of these two technology development programs to produce wireless, uniquely identifiable SAW-based hydrogen sensors, and to evaluate the sensor response time to low levels of hydrogen exposure (down to 1 ppm).  ASR&D will also implement a SAW-based in-situ Pd deposition monitor for enhanced film reproducibility.  ASR&D's previous hydrogen work was based on Argonne National Labs work with similar films that demonstrated hydrogen sensing from 25 ppm to over 2% hydrogen, with response times of milliseconds, complete reversibility, and no baseline drift at room temperature.  ASR&D demonstrated the ability to measure changes in such films using a SAW sensor, however our ability to test at low hydrogen concentrations and at rates exceeding 1 sample/sec were limited by our experimental test equipment.  In the proposed effort, we will utilize an Environics gas dilution system to generate calibrated gas concentrations (for hydrogen and methane) down to 1 ppm, and we will utilize the electronic interrogation system being developed for our RFID work to measure the sensors.  This system is capable of measuring sensor responses with a good S/N in 1 msec (or less), overcoming the prior limitations of our testbench equipment.  In addition to the hydrogen sensor work, working with Temple University, we propose to evaluate the technical feasibility of producing SAW-based methane sensors using a similar SAW sensor device, but incorporating methane selective supramolecular cryptophane films.  Hydrogen sensors will be TRL4 at completion of the proposed effort, and methane sensors will be TRL 3.* [MEMS Gyroscope with Interferometric Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sbcn-zzcy) - The proposed innovation is a novel MEMS gyroscope that uses micro-interferometric detection to measure the motion of the proof mass. Using an interferometric detection technique enables the measurement of proof mass motion with resolution equal to or better than systems that have CMOS detection electronics fabricated on the MEMS substrate. Furthermore, this detection technique can be applied to MEMS designs fabricated in a variety of processes, freeing up more design space and enabling a MEMS design not limited by MEMS fabrication constraints. This combination of factors allows for a broader design space and thus the sense resonant frequency will not have to be closely matched to the drive resonant frequency. This separation of frequencies results in a device that is inherently more stable and easier to manufacture. Specific objective of phase II are: (1) Produce a low cost, low power MEMS gyroscope using interferometric sensing that meets the needs for NASA applications. (2) Deliver multiple prototypes to NASA and other potential customers for evaluation. (3) Demonstrate that the gyroscope prototypes have acceptable performance. The challenges to successfully developing this technology are substantial. Advanced MEMS fabrication technology, innovative micro-optical designs coupled with novel MEMS packaging, and design and simulation techniques will enable successful development of this technology.* [Global Aerosol Measurement System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3b79-8d2b) - <p>The Global Aerosol Measurement System (GAMS) project is developing a new, low cost satellite capability for measuring the properties and distributions of particles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (collectively, the UTLS).&nbsp; This altitude region is important because there have been observed increases in the amount of particles in the UTLS.&nbsp; These particles typically reflect sunlight back into space and cool the Earth.&nbsp; GAMS will measure the altitudes and amounts of these particles by looking to the side of the spacecraft, through the thickness of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, and provide detailed information about how particles are changing in the UTLS.</p> <p>The goal of the Global Aerosol Measurement System (GAMS) project is to develop needed technologies and obervation strategies to optimally measure the distributions and properties of particles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS).&nbsp; The GAMS concept is based on the limb-scattering measurement techniques used on past sensors, most directly from the heritage of the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) Limb Profiler (LP) currently flying on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) spacecraft.&nbsp; OMPS-LP was launched on Suomi NPP in 2011, with the next planned launch of this instrument in 2022 on the next generation Joint Polar Satellite System-2 (JPSS-2).&nbsp; Because of the length of time between the NPP and JPSS-2 launches there is the potential for a significant data gap for these important measurements.&nbsp; The GAMS concept is intended to be a simple and low cost measurement system that could be ready to fill such a gap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The current OMPS-LP system measures light reflected by particles in the UTLS by looking behind the Suomi NPP path, looking through the thickness of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere (i.e., the limb).&nbsp; Although OMPS-LP has proven capable of detecting the presence of background particles in the UTLS, as well as particles from volcanic eruptions and meteorites entering Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere from space, it has very limited spatial coverage and suffers from sensitivity issues since it preferentially sees particles in one direct with respect to the sun.&nbsp; GAMS seeks to overcome both limitations by making measurements of reflected light In two or more directions relative to the spacecraft flight.&nbsp; Because GAMS focuses only on the limb profiling capabilities (versus the more comprehensive by more complicated OMPS system) it can be contained in a relatively smaller spacecraft, which will reduce deployment costs.&nbsp; Additional increased spatial coverage can be realized by flying multiple copies of the GAMS instrument in different orbits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At this stage of the GAMS project we are refining science requirements and measurement capabilities.&nbsp; Working with simulations of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) atmospheric model we are refining both the number of viewing directions and the number of spectral channels needed to adequately measure the particles in the UTLS.&nbsp; Engineering work is being performed to refine the GAMS measurement strategy, focused on detector design.</p>* [Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution](https://data.nasa.gov/d/x49s-bpqi) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI) 

Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation (WASP). Utilizing average monthly precipitation data from 1980 through 2000 at a resolution of 2.5 degrees, WASP assesses the precipitation 

deficit or surplus over a three month temporal window that is weighted by the magnitude of the seasonal cyclic variation in precipitation. The three months' averages are derived from the 

precipitation data and the median rainfall for the 21 year period is calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells where the three month running average of precipitation is less than 1 mm per 

day ae excluded. Drought events are identified when the magnitude of a monthly precipitation deficit is less than or equal to 50 percent of its longterm median value for three or more 

consecutive months. Grid cells are then divided into 10 classes having an approximately equal number of grid cells. Higher grid cell values denote higher frequencies of drought occurrences. 

This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate 

Prediction (IRI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Development of Reconfigurable Ka-Band Antenna Array](https://data.nasa.gov/d/myc7-huf9) - NASA requires small and lightweight communication and remote sensing systems to accomplish its missions. Often performance drives engineering designs, but for NASA, there is an inherent tradeoff between performance and weight. As would be expected, weight and size limitations impact system functionality and performance. Also, in many recent NASA missions, there is a need for communication system reconfiguration after launch.

These limitations have prompted a desire for multibeam and wideband antennas that can realize reconfigurable functionality. Reflector and lens antennas are typically used for satellites. However, phased arrays offer many advantages over reflectors and lenses. They provide higher aperture efficiency and power amplification at the element level. Also, they have no spillover loss, no aperture blockage, and better reliability. However, they have not been adapted as much due to their limited bandwidth and technology costs for reconfiguration.

Recent developments in wave slow down techniques using metamaterials have now allowed for very thin conformal antenna apertures that are concurrently broadband (as much as 10:1). This overcomes the ensuing conundrum of narrowband printed antenna technologies. Also, low cost multibeam approaches and software reconfigurable feeds are now possible to enable low cost conformal Ka band arrays. 

Here, I am proposing a novel wideband metamaterial technology that relies on our group's experience and recent developments on wideband small arrays and multibeam technologies. The proposed metamaterial array technology is based on the novel concept of emulating in-plane anisotropy to introduce many more design degrees of freedom to achieve significant wave slow down and wide bandwidth. As part of this fellowship, I will adapt these new metamaterial concepts to develop wideband (>4:1 bandwidth) Ka-band arrays. The array will also include low cost software-defined RF electronics for beam synthesis and reconfiguration.* [SiC Matrix Composites for High Temperature Hypersonic Vehicle Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rj5v-dk7c) - Durable high temperature materials are required for reusable hypersonic structural thermal protection systems. In particular, temperatures exceeding 2700ºF, and approaching 3000ºF, are targeted for capable structural materials that can survive stresses on the order of 10 ksi (70 MPa) for at least 100 hours in an oxidizing environment.  Such materials have been identified as an enabling material for future hypersonic vehicles  As this application is structural, a strong degree of damage tolerance is desired, and thus ceramic matrix composites
are the primary choice due to the desire for reduced weight, high temperature strength and oxidation resistance. Silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix (SiC/SiC) composites are believed to be the most suitable solution due to meeting the requirements
with the limitations of creep at the highest temperatures/loads, and oxidative attack at stresses that exceed the materials proportional limit. The proposed effort will define the temperature-stress limit of SiC/SiC composites, and examine methods to further extend this limit.* [Cyber Partners: Harnessing Group Dynamics to Boost Motivation for More Efficient Exercise](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6r4s-yjz8) - Original Project Aims/Objectives: The focus of the project is to use recently documented motivation gains in task groups (dyads in particular) to heighten the exercise experience for astronauts and help keep them motivated to exercise at levels necessary to mitigate reductions in aerobic fitness and muscle loss over long space missions. A secondary focus is to determine the most effective features in exercise partners for enhancing, enjoyment, confidence, and social connectedness. Specific aims: (1) Develop software to create Software Generated (SG) exercise partners and interface with exercise equipment (cycle ergometer) similar to equipment available on the International Space Station; (2) Test various design features of an SG partner within designed exercise video games to determine the most effective features for enhancing motivation to exercise, enjoyment, confidence, and connectedness; and (3) Test whether exercising with an SG partner over a 24-weeks, compared to exercising alone, leads to better aerobic capacity and muscle strength, adherence to exercise regimen, enhanced exercise enjoyment, self-efficacy, and sense of social connectedness.    
Key Findings since last report: In Year 3, we continued work on Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2 was a short-term study (6 days) to determine the most effective partners to enhance exercise intensity.    
In Aim 2, we tested an SG partner in one of three modes against an individual control condition: (a) coacting mode, where the subject cycled with the SG partner but whose performance was independent of the partner (i.e., they were not teammates), (b) conjunctive-teammate mode, where scores were based on the slower performer, and (c) choice mode where subject could choose coacting mode or conjunctive teammate mode for all trials. The experiment used activity routines developed by Ploutz-Snyder that consist of (a) 30 min. of continuous aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer at or above 75% of maximum heart rate (HR max) and (b) high-intensity interval training involving 4 repetitions of 4 min. at or above 90% HR max. In Aim 2 (Year 3), we tested an additional 38 chronic exercisers (22 female). Subjects (N = 82, 47 female; M age = 44.89, 9.45) were allowed to adjust the power output (watts) during workouts. The main outcome variable was average watts cycled above target prescribed watts. Results showed no condition main effects from baseline; however, during the 4 min. interval sessions conjunctive (Mdiff = 5.23 watts) trended toward greater exercise effort than control (Mdiff = 4.45 watts) and coactive conditions (3.46 watts). The 4 min. intervals probably represent the most motivationally demanding workout at 90% HR max. Increases in effort above target watts positively correlated with Enjoyment (r = .44), Self-efficacy (r = .51), and Team perceptions (r = .21) during the 4 min. intervals. No relationships were found with less intense continuous exercise. Although this pilot study did not find significant between group increases in performance effort, participants significantly increased their effort with our exercise video game (i.e., simulated bike paths).    
In Aim 3, long-term study, we tested an SG exercise partner in one of two modes: (a) conjunctive-teammate mode and (b) conjunctive teammate who is not always superior (NAS) and is sometimes surpassed by the subject (~15% of the time), plus (c) individual control condition. We finished both cohorts of subjects (Cohort 1 = 23; 11 female; Cohort 2 = 18; 7 female). Subjects (N = 41; M age = 45.53 8.12) exercised 6 days/week for 24 weeks, using the following aerobic routines developed by Ploutz-Snyder: (a) 30 min. of continuous aerobic exercise on a stationary cycle at or above 75% HR max, (b) 4x4 min. intervals at or above 90% HR max with 3 min. active rest, (c) 6x2 min. intervals at varying intensities with 2 min. active rest, and (d) 30 sec. sprint intervals at maximal effort with 20 sec. active rest. We first tested whether the Conjunc* [Extreme Energy Particle Astrophysics with ANITA-V [University of Delaware] Co-I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/masx-mwzg) - This is the Co-I for the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) mission. ANITA seeks to detect and elucidate the sources of the highest energy particles in the universe via measurements of cosmogenic ultra-high energy neutrinos. Such neutrinos are in many cases predicted to be the only unattenuated astrophysical messengers that arrive at Earth with precise directional information, since neutrinos are neutral particles with very weak interactions with matter in intergalactic space. Neutrinos that ANITA seeks to detect will signal the presence of the most extreme astrophysical accelerators and environments, and complement the information available via electromagnetic messengers from gamma-rays to radio waves.

ANITA uses a long-duration balloon payload equipped with 48 dual-polarization horn antennas to detect radio impulses in the frequency range 200-1200 MHz, within which the properties of cold Antarctic ice include extreme radio-transparency and depths of up to 4 km. If a neutrino interacts anywhere within the ice sheet in ANITA's view from stratospheric altitudes, we can detect the emerging radio impulse and determine its direction and other characteristics with high precision. This in turn allows us to select candidate neutrinos from among the thermal and anthropogenic backgrounds with high confidence, and to derive angular information about the arrival direction of such candidates as well.

Recently ANITA analysis investigated a new detection channel, which focuses on tau-lepton-generating neutrinos, which lead to a unique experimental signature for which ANITA has potentially very high sensitivity, and a candidate event has been detected in prior data. This new detection channel has added to the variety of methods by which ANITA continues to improve its sensitivity and reach into predicted models for cosmogenic neutrinos, for which ANITA has among the best constraints of any detector to date.

ANITA is currently the only active NASA mission with the capability to measure ultra-high energy neutrinos, and ANITA's ultra-high energy neutrino sensitivity while on orbit is unmatched by any other instrument, ground- or space-based. As such it is a direct contributor to our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe, through astrophysical messengers that provide unique information about the most extreme and energetic objects in the cosmos.* [Single-Process, Unitized, Composite Fuselage, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/snvy-6aj8) - NASA seeks tailored airframes and structures to reduce structural mass in support of the NASA Aeronautics Strategic Implementation Plan (2015), following the Roadmap for Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles, Subsonic Transport. Tailored structures are comprised of the right materials, at the right place, in the right orientation, in the right amount. Whatever the material or structural configuration, excess weight is driven out through optimization, within the limitations of the manufacturing approach. CRG has been laying the foundation for the design and production of tailored structures for more than a decade. CRG's vision for tailored airframes and structures begins with unitization, enabled by Smart Tooling for affordable manufacturing of complex composites. CRG began work on Smart Tooling for fuselages in 2005, targeting fully-integrated, single-process skins, stringers, and frames. CRG subsidiary Spintech launched in 2010 to commercialize Smart Tooling into the aerospace industry, and soon after demonstrated a quarter-scale unitized fuselage. Today, CRG brings robust capabilities in composite structural optimization, expanding capabilities in aerospace composite fabrication, leading-edge understanding of hybrid nano-composites, and Spintech's Smart Tooling technology to provide NASA with advanced, highly-tailored fuselage configurations with unmatched structural efficiency.* [Europan Molecular Indicators of Life Investigation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4kk9-yw3c) - The Europa Lander mission represents an enormous opportunity to capitalize on scientific discoveries at Europa by enhancing its planned exploration, toward a direct search for signs of life. The full understanding of Europa’s habitability will be established by the Europa Multiple Flyby Mission (EMFM). The EMFM payload, including highly capable imagers, spectrophotometers, mass spectrometers, and particle and wave sensors, will make critical observations of Europa’s subsurface ocean, its complex icy surface, and its surface-bounded exosphere to produce a clear picture of the extent and cycling of its water and chemical inventories. With this foundation, a follow-up lander will then be able to address hypotheses about key astrobiological markers in the icy surface. If deep plume activity is confirmed, the lander could potentially sample fresh, ocean-borne surface deposits for biosignature detection.
With these ambitious objectives, relative to the timeframe for lander payload selection, it is absolutely imperative to focus attention on instrument technologies that both (1) address expected complex molecular detection and characterization requirements with exquisite sensitivity and specificity, and (2) are on a realistic technical path to compatibility with the extreme payload resource and environmental constraints of a Europa surface mission. We propose to mature a Europa-specific implementation of the Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (LITMS) investigation to meet these dual requirements in the search for signs of extant life.
LITMS is a dual-ion source precision molecular analyzer derived from the substantial heritage of the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) investigation under development in our lab for the ExoMars rover. LITMS brings the power of both gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) of solid samples to fine spatial scales (sub-mm) with its precision analyses. As on Mars, detection of complex organics at fine scales offers significant advantages in examining features key to distinguishing biogenic and abiogenic molecules, compared to bulk analysis. LITMS further provides enhanced capabilities, compared to MOMA, including detection of both positive and negative ions, a wider range of molecular weights (to over 2 kDa), and direct evolved gas analysis – all of which substantially increase the sensitivity of LITMS to the widest possible range of molecular organic biosignatures within their geochemical context. LITMS has been developed for the past three years with support of the MatISSE program, and will achieve TRL 6 for Mars surface operations at the end of this year.
To re-achieve TRL 6 for a Europa lander mission focused on extant life, we will focus our COLDTech effort in three critical areas: (1) Refinement and validation of the precision sampling GCMS + LDMS operational modes for characterization of trace complex molecular biosignatures in cryogenic Europan samples; (2) Analysis, testing, and optimization of the appropriate LITMS hardware and operational mitigation approaches for the intense penetrating radiation at Europa; and (3) Design and development of a flight-like LITMS brassboard for Europa that (3a) rigorously meets PDR-level TRL 6 criteria, and (3b) enables a flight design demonstrably compliant with the most stringent planetary protection and contamination control requirements of the mission.
Lacking a requirement to redesign the core LITMS analyzer, which has already been developed at flight scale and meets extremely challenging measurement requirements for Mars missions, our proposed COLDTech development is able to devote significant and necessary attention to the Europa-specific features to minimize technical and cost risk of an eventual flight model. With COLDTech support we anticipate that LITMS could be among the few investigations that would be fully ready for the challenge of contributing to direct detection of life on Europa.* [Performance Quantification of Solar Sail Heliogyros for Planetary and Interplanetary Missions Using Multi-Scale Dynamics and Control Analysis](https://data.nasa.gov/d/94tm-ppn9) - The focus of this proposal is the guidance and control of a particular type of solar sail and supports NASA's exploration goals as outlined in TABS element 2.2.2: Solar Sail Propulsion. Solar sails are large, extremely thin sheets of reflective material that use sunlight to provide continuous thrust. To provide meaningful thrust levels, the sails must be lightweight, gossamer structures with several hundred square meters or more of reflective area. The primary advantage of sails is that they do not use propellant for thrust or attitude control allowing for theoretically infinite mission duration and infinite impulse. It is this elegance and limitless potential that make sails so attractive.

Research into this cutting-edge propulsion system has extraordinary promise for a wide variety of applications. Solar sails could make many prohibitively expensive missions cost-effective and enable many more that are impossible without sail power. For example, a sail-craft placed between the Earth and the Sun could enhance solar storm early-warning and help protect the nation's space assets. Also, a sail-craft could attack the growing threat of space debris by capturing defunct satellites, shuttling them to a super-GEO graveyard, and repeating indefinitely. Further down the road, sails offer the prospect of inexpensive, reusable cargo transport to Mars and beyond. These are just a few of the many applications of this technology. Nevertheless, much work remains before government and commercial agencies will commit to a large-scale sail-craft mission.

This research aims to further develop guidance and control for a specific type of solar sail: the heliogyro. In this case, the sail is divided into long blades supported by the centripetal acceleration of the spacecraft's spin alone. The heliogyro's attitude, and therefore thrust vector, is controlled by changing the cyclic and collective blade pitch similar to a helicopter. One advantage of this design over a more traditional square sail is the lack of blade support structure. This cuts mass and increases acceleration or payload capacity. Additionally, sail deployment is much simplified; simply spin the spacecraft up, and allow the blades to unspool.

The inability to effectively ground test such large, delicate structures makes a deeper analytical understanding essential. This research will attempt to show that heliogyros are a viable method of both attitude control and main propulsion. The objective is to answer three essential questions about heliogyro controllability: 
How much can heliogyros improve mission performance? 
What are the feasible attitude control methods to achieve that performance? 
How can we control the pitch of highly-flexible blades to attain the desired attitude? 
NASA, especially JPL and Marshall Space Flight Center, have been developing this technology intermittently for decades. As early as the sixties, JPL conducted preliminary design work on a heliogyro for a Halley's Comet rendezvous mission. More recently, they developed the S5 (Solar Sail Spaceflight Simulation Software) toolkit. Marshall launched a solar sail proof-of-concept, NanoSail-D, only weeks ago and is developing its successor, FeatherSail. This research will combine an analytical exploration of the fundamental concepts, simulations of the orbital and attitude mechanics, and finite element analysis of the sail structural dynamics to develop a comprehensive theory of the factors involved in solar sail control. The goal is to provide engineers with the tools required to design and plan a heliogyro sail-craft mission so that someday soon we may begin to realize the vast potential solar sails have to offer.* [On Applying the Prognostic Performance Metrics](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u9bu-4253) - Prognostics performance evaluation has gained significant attention in the past few years. *As prognostics technology matures and more sophisticated methods for prognostic uncertainty management are developed, a standardized methodology for performance evaluation becomes extremely important to guide improvement efforts in a constructive manner. This paper is in continuation of previous efforts where several new evaluation metrics tailored for prognostics were introduced and were shown to effectively evaluate various algorithms as compared to other conventional metrics. Specifically, this paper presents a detailed discussion on how these metrics should be interpreted and used. Several shortcomings identified, while applying these metrics to a variety of real applications, are also summarized along with discussions that attempt to alleviate these problems. Further, these metrics have been enhanced to include the capability of incorporating probability distribution information from prognostic algorithms as opposed to evaluation based on point estimates only. Several methods have been suggested and guidelines have been provided to help choose one method over another based on probability distribution characteristics.* [Microfluidic Label-Free Sensing for Rapid Multiplexed Pathogen Detection in Space Missions](https://data.nasa.gov/d/e2ry-j347) - For the success of most space programs involving environmental control and waste water management, the rapid detection and identification of pathogens under resource limitations is essential. From the basic scientific research standpoint, the capability to monitor and detect microbial responses to microgravity and other low-shear environments in situ would significantly advance the present state of knowledge. Current cell culture or molecular biology based methods are time and labor-consuming, vulnerable to contamination, demand laboratory equipment, and require sophisticated manual preparation such as lysing, staining or labeling.
To overcome these barriers, the PI proposes an integrated microfluidic sensor combining automated sample handling and label-free detection via molecular and plasmonic imaging that acquires molecular fingerprints from the whole organism, surface biomarkers and intra-organism biomarkers, thus achieving multiscale “compartmentalization”. The PI will actively collaborate with a group of microbiologists at NASA and other institutions to study microbial and viral responses to microgravity, high-energy radiation, genetic alteration, and emerging carbon materials such as nanotubes and grapheme.* [GPM PR on TRMM Precipitation Statistics, at Surface and Fixed Heights 1 day 0.25x0.25 degree V06 (GPM_3PRD) at GES DISC](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rm6m-bthu) - Version 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.

This is the GPM-like formatted TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) daily gridded data, first released with the "V8" TRMM reprocessing. The daily radar grid data is new for TRMM nomenclature and is introduced for consistency with the GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). The closest ancestor was 3A25 which was a monthly radar statistics.

This product consists of daily statistics of the PR measurements at (0.25x0.25) degrees horizontal resolution.

The objective of the algorithm is to calculate various daily statistics from the level 2 PR
output products. Four types of statistics are calculated:
1. Probabilities of occurrence (count values)
2. Means and standard deviations
In all cases, the statistics are conditioned on the presence of rain or some other quantity such
as the presence of stratiform rain or the presence of a bright-band. For example, to compute
the unconditioned mean rain rate, the conditional mean must be multiplied by the probability
of rain which, in turn is calculated from the ratio of rain counts to the total number of
observations in the box of interest. 

The grids are in the Planetary Grid 2 structure matching the Dual-frequency PR on the core GPM observatory that covers 67S to 67N degrees of latitudes. Areas beyond the ±40 degrees of latitudes  are padded with empty grid cells.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Final Weekly Combined Earth Rotation Parameters Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5sj6-5zbm) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Weekly Combined Station Position Earth Rotation Parameter (ERP) product (produced during the reference frame combination) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

The input to the Active Fires production are Level-1B moderate-resolution reflective band M7, and emissive bands M13 and M15. The fire algorithm first calculates bands M13, M15 brightness temperature (BT) statistics for a group of background pixels adjacent to each potential fire pixel. These statistics are used to set thresholds for several contextual fire detection tests. There is also an absolute fire detection test based on a pre-set M13 BT threshold. If the results of the absolute and relative fire detection tests meet certain criteria, the pixel is labeled as fire. The designation of a pixel as fire from the results of the BT threshold tests may be overridden under sun glint conditions or if too few pixels were used to calculate the background statistics.

The VNP14_NRT product contains several pieces of information for each fire pixel: pixel coordinates, latitude and longitude, pixel M7 reflectance, background M7 reflectance, pixel M13 and M15 BT, background M13 and M15 BT, mean background BT difference, background M13, M15, and BT difference mean absolute deviation, fire radiative power, number of adjacent cloud pixels, number of adjacent water pixels, background window size, number of valid background pixels, detection confidence, land pixel flag, background M7 reflectance, and reflectance mean absolute deviation.

The product provides day and nighttime active fire detection over land and water (from gas flares). The VNP14 product provides fire data continuity with NASA's EOS MODIS 1 km fire product.

RNA-Seq was used to define the large-scale gene expression profiles of Mizuna harvested after 27 days cultivation in the international space station to understand the molecular response and adaptation to space environment.Results: Total reads of transcripts from the Mizuna grown in the international space station as well as on the ground by RNA-Seq using next generation sequencing technology showed 8,258 and 14,170 transcripts up- and down-regulated in the space-grown Mizuna respectively when compared with those from the ground-grown Mizuna. A total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative marker genes were up-regulated including high expression of 4 hallmarks and preferentially expressed gene associated with ROS-scavenging genes was thioredoxin glutaredoxin and alternative oxidase genes. In the transcription factors of ROS gene network MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 OXI1-MKK4-MPK3 and OXI1-MPK3 of MAP cascades induction of WRKY22 by MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 cascade induction of WRKY25 and repression of ZAT7 by Zat12 were suggested.

Frameworks and tools for uncertainty quantification are generally geared to individual codes, are research codes, or are single-purpose tools such as LHS matrix generators. The Reduced-Order-Clustering-Uncertainty-Quantification (ROCUQ) methodology discussed in this proposal is specifically designed to circumvent many of the issues associated with uncertainty quantification of large simulation codes. The ROCUQ methodology has been applied in several different physical disciplines with good results. The computational methodology is a combination of reduced-order modeling, stratified sampling (Latin Hypercube Sampling -- LHS), statistical clustering of results (K-means clustering) and a few (five to ten) full-physics runs of the high-fidelity model under investigation. The method should be applicable to hundreds of uncertain variables when required. ROCUQ enables estimates of system response quantities (SRQ) uncertainty distributions for situations where it is not feasible to use purely sampling, collocation, or other techniques where many runs would be required. For some organizations, uncertainty analysis has never been possible due to resource limitations, and thus is not part of the organizational culture. Many analysts know that uncertainties can be important, but have no way to expend sufficient resources (money, CPU cycles, time) to do the work needed to quantify uncertainties. A methodology such as ROCUQ promises to open doors in organizations that know that they have the need, and may now be able to actually perform the analyses. Successful completion of the Phase II project will produce not only new software that will be able to be used by researchers and industry, but will assemble insights on the use of reduced order models in a variety of disciplines, and provide guidance and rules for the use of ROCUQ for the estimation of SRQ uncertainty distributions.* [Hiawatha Aircraft Anti-Collision System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/meqd-gy77) - For SUAVs, the FAA mandate to equip all aircraft with ADS-B Out transmitters by 1 January 2020 to support NextGen goals presents both logistical and mission security issues.  Aircraft without ADS-B Out capabilities, ranging from commercial or general aviation aircraft with failed transponders to adversarial aircraft deliberately operating without required transponder equipment, will continue to exist within the general airspace and pose navigational hazards and tactical threats to SUAVs. Nokomis proposes to adapt its ultra-sensitive RF sensor system, called Hiawatha, to provide an unsurpassed trajectory management and anti-collision avoidance capability.  The Hiawatha system provides flight-tested state-of-the-art ultra-sensitive RF detection, identification and geo-location performance.  Nokomis will develop a system-level design of an anti-collision system to aid in trajectory management and safe traffic flow of autonomous UAV operations capable of meeting the SWaP requirements for incorporation into a representative SUAV payload platform.  The RF-based traffic management and anti-collision avoidance system will be capable of monitoring the entire spectral range from 30 MHz to 3 GHz, while providing the necessary detection, identification, and locating abilities from all angles while operating in a non-interfering manner with other potential payloads. Specifically, Nokomis will demonstrate system sensitivity including long range detection and identification of representative UAV emissions, system geo-location and contact bearing capabilities, Doppler-based bearing and range to aircraft, and design Trajectory Prediction and Avoidance System and efficient Traffic Flow System for maintaining aircraft spacing. The Phase I effort proof of concept demonstrations will focus on a demonstration of the Hiawatha airborne system, detection, identification, and location of relevant targets using existing AoA algorithms, and existing source classification algorithms.* [Colloid Thruster for Attitude Control Systems (ACS) and Tip-off Control Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q6sy-k4ti) - Busek proposes to develop and deliver a complete engineering model colloid thruster system, capable of thrust levels and lifetimes required for spacecraft operational tasks such as tip-off de-tumbling and attitude control.   The self contained thruster system shall be capable of delivering ~75µN with sufficient total impulse to de-tumble spacecraft such as LISA.
 
The proposed Phase 2 work builds upon a highly successful Phase 1 effort where the key principals of the innovation, a propellant isolation membrane and a passive capillary feed system, were unequivocally demonstrated.  The proposed system is completely passive with no moving parts and requires no valves to ensure its high reliability.  In order to inhibit propellant contamination prior to operation in space, a unique isolation membrane will separate propellant from the emitter.  Upon heating the isolation membrane dissolves, allowing propellant from a collocated reservoir to flow forward to the electrospray thruster without contamination.  The thruster consists of an array of self adjusting emission sites that are activated by application of an electric field that initiates emission.  The delivered thrust is modulated by varying the applied electric field. 

The significant innovations of the proposed colloid thruster include: a compact, low power, modular thruster system containing no moving parts, which is capable of delivering sufficient thrust for spacecraft tip-off control and ACS applications.* [Model-Based Specification Checker for Multi-Domain Systems (SpecCheck), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bchn-8qa4) - NASA's software-intensive extraterrestrial exploration and observation systems are raising performance and reliability bars to unprecedented levels.  Exaggerating the complexity, in order for such systems to be robust and responsive they must have the ability to use intelligent processes to self-detect and heal, or literally create new programs in response to new situations.  Validating the readiness of such complex automated software for long term remote deployment demands not just covering code or branches, or even inputs and outputs, but rather to cover algorithms, rule bases, and states within the system.  Even when reducing the order of the problem through traceable model extraction and abstraction we are left with state explosion that drives the test of mission-critical software to unacceptable cost and time extremes. Yet it must be done. This has been a matter of active research at EDAptive Computing, Inc. (ECI), NASA, and elsewhere.  Modern specification and software modeling techniques combined with formal methods have yielded promising results.  We have demonstrated parts of the solution with smaller scale flight-critical [USAF] software and [MDA] satellite systems.  ECI is now uniquely poised to merge and bring the needed technology to fruition at the scale necessary for NASA Exploration Systems.* [Crucial Component Damage Detection, Monitoring and Mitigation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vmd7-wm5x) - This SBIR project delivers an on-board structural health-monitoring (SHM) system with embedded sensors that sense mechanical impedance deviations to flag incipient damage in time to recover from or prevent in-flight failures. This Component Damage Mitigation (CDM) system integrates early damage detection with failure recovery measures such as self-healing fasteners.

Implications of the innovation
Next Generation Air Transport Systems bring increasingly demanding weight and performance needs that encourage aircraft to operate relatively close to their design limits--minor structural failure can mean rapid catastrophe. On-board sensing, diagnostic, and damage mitigation capabilities are needed for early correction of incipient damage. However, no practical system exists. We address this deficiency by building on our existing SHM unit and incorporating damage mitigation.

Technical objectives
CDM leverages our work in impedance-based SHM. Our current prototype consists of a single custom electronics board, and is a TRL 5 unit. We have demonstrated field operation in Boeing launch simulation tests and on full-scale wind turbine blades. We propose to integrate our current approach with damage mitigation measures and to create a practical single-chip solution. We include computer modeling that generates virtual data in our sensor validation.

Research description
Phase 1 establishes feasibility for a single-chip approach based on the impedance method, and demonstrates damage mitigation on a model self-healing fastener. Phase 2 completes and validates single chip development, integrates damage detection and mitigation, and delivers an operational unit.

Anticipated results
Phase 1 demonstrates damage detection/mitigation integration and provides a detailed chip roadmap. Phase 2 delivers an operational unit that performs integrated damage detection, monitoring, and mitigation in crucial propulsion system and airframe components.* [Cradle-to-Grave Monitoring of Composite Aircraft Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qnzk-i9mb) - NextGen is proposing a simple yet powerful damage identification technique for advanced composite structures.  We propose to develop a damage index based on vibration signature comparison with original signatures of the structure. Our approach is to autonomously perform damage detection as well as identification of non-service loading events by minimum number of sensors. We will start with the preliminary work done by Dr. Mal at UCLA and improve upon it to achieve the objective of cradle-to-grave degradation monitoring. The overall goal of the program is to develop an accurate, rapid, inexpensive method for detection of composite internal damage including bonds strength in built-up structures. The objective of the Phase I program is to develop and demonstrate that the proposed technique is accurate and reliable.  We will achieve TRL of 2 in Phase I and subsequent technology transition to TRL of 4 in Phase II. NextGen's strength lies in related prior work, an in-depth understanding of damage modes in advanced composite structures, and comprehensive knowledge of damage detection techniques.  Dr. Ajit Mal of the Mechanical Engineering Department at UCLA has an exceptional background in structural health monitoring built on decades of cutting edge research in NDE* [NONA Cure of Prepreg Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n3fr-ckaj) - CRG's no-oven, no-autoclave (NONA) composite processing technology enables the fabrication of high-performance composite parts without the limitations imposed by autoclaves and ovens.

The NONA process enables the remote fabrication of complex, integrated structures, dramatically shifting the composites manufacturing paradigm. Qualified autoclave or OoA prepreg tapes can be applied simultaneously with dry unidirectional (UD) tapes in an automated process. The presence of dry fibers throughout the layup before infusion allows improved breathing, removal of volatiles from prepreg, and improved compaction with only atmospheric pressure, mimicking the double vacuum debulk (DVD) process without the added equipment. NONA resin is then introduced to the evacuated layup at ambient temperature to wet out all available contact surfaces and cure itself and the prepreg in place. The NONA epoxy resin uses its own chemical energy to propel itself through a complete cure with no external heat required. With a high degree of crosslinking, the baseline NONA resin provides good strength, chemical resistance, and thermal performance up to 350 degrees F. Pairing NONA resin with a compatible prepreg, such as IM7/Cycom 977-3 or Hexcel IM7/8552-1, a cure of both systems can be achieved at room temperature. Because the cure occurs at room temperature, the NONA resin locks in its shape near room temperature, thus allowing the use of low-cost tooling materials, typically avoided because the of high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).* [Component-Based QoS-Driven Synthesis of High Assurance Embedded Software, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wpkf-tajw) - Software is an integral part of many complex embedded systems, such as avionics, scientific exploration, and on-board systems. However, poor software reliability is a major impediment to the success of these mission-critical systems. Testing, formal verification, and code synthesis techniques have been proposed to achieve more reliable software, with automated code synthesis being the most promising method. But synthesizing a complex system from scratch is costly.  A more practical approach is to synthesize systems from existing components, i.e., component-based system synthesis (CBSS).  Existing research in CBSS focuses on synthesizing systems bottom-up, which has severe limitations.  We propose to achieve CBSS by combining the top-down and bottom-up approaches. Specifically, we develop techniques to achieve automated system decomposition and semi-automated system architecture synthesis.  The IDEAL decomposition technique decomposes a system into ``IDEAL'' units that are mathematically composable and can be developed and evolved independently.  Consequently, the technique assures system reliability and enables on-the-fly feature/technology upgrades. The QoS-based architecture synthesis technique seeks to assure system QoS properties by synthesizing an architecture that optimizes QoS objectives.  It also facilitates on-board system adaptation due to resource and power constraints. Combined with bottom-up techniques, such as Amphion and pattern-based code synthesis, a dramatic leap in automated CBSS capability can be achieved. The proposed research will lead to sophisticated automation for synthesizing highly reliable, multi-mission capable avionics and exploration systems.* [HELIX: The High Energy Light Isotope Experiment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vaef-dbnm) - This is the lead proposal for a new suborbital program, HELIX (High-Energy Light Isotope eXperiment), designed to make measurements of the isotopic composition of light cosmic-ray nuclei from ~200 MeV/nuc to ~10 GeV/nuc. Past measurements of this kind have provided profound insights into the nature and origin of cosmic rays, revealing, for instance, information on acceleration and confinement time scales, and exposing some conspicuous discrepancies between solar and cosmic-ray abundances. The most detailed information currently available comes from the ACE/CRIS mission, but is restricted to energies below a few 100 MeV/nuc. HELIX aims at extending this energy range by over an order of magnitude, where, in most cases, no measurements of any kind exist, and where relativistic time dilation affects the apparent lifetime of radioactive clock nuclei. The HELIX measurements will provide essential information for understanding the propagation history of cosmic rays in the galaxy. This is crucial for properly interpreting several intriguing anomalies reported in recent cosmic-ray measurements, pertaining to the energy spectra of protons, helium, and heavier nuclei, and to the anomalous rise in the positron fraction at higher energy.

HELIX employs a high-precision magnet spectrometer to provide measurements which are not achievable by any current or planned instrument. The superconducting magnet originally used for the HEAT payload in five successful high-altitude flights will be combined with state-of-the-art detectors to measure the charge, time-of-flight, magnetic rigidity, and velocity of cosmic-ray particles with high precision. The instrumentation includes plastic scintillators, silicon-strip detectors repurposed from Fermilab's CDF detector, a high-performance gas drift chamber, and a ring-imaging Cherenkov counter employing aerogel radiators and silicon photomultipliers. 

To reduce cost and technical risk, the HELIX program will be structured in two stages.  The first stage, which is the subject of this proposal, will focus on the design and construction of the main HELIX instrument, and the measurement of key light isotope ratios from ~200 MeV/n to ~3GeV/n.  A future stage 2 will build on this work, incorporating evolutionary enhancements to the instrumentation to extend the energy reach into the challenging ~10 GeV/n range.  The stage 1 instrument achieves a maximum detectable rigidity of ~800GV and charge range from Z=1 to Z=10. The high field of the HEAT magnet will make it possible to reach the required mass resolution dm/m = 2.5% over the energy range of concern with very small systematic limitations due to multiple Coulomb scattering in the thin tracker. This is a decisive advantage over the current AMS-02 instrument which employs a permanent magnet with an average field ~7 times smaller than that of HELIX.

The primary scientific goals of the full HELIX program are:

- a high-statistics measurement of the 10Be/9Be 'clock ratio' to ~10 GeV/nuc

- a high-statistics measurement of the 3He/4He ratio to ~12GeV/nuc

- the first measurements of 22Ne/20Ne above 1 GeV/nuc

- the first measurements of 7Li/6Li, and 10B/11B above 1 GeV//nuc

A number of secondary goals will also be pursued including the measurement of several other isotopic and elemental abundance ratios and fluxes, as well as the primary Helium flux to ~125 GeV/nuc, where there is currently disagreement between AMS-02 and PAMELA on the shape of the energy spectrum.

The proposed work will be conducted by a team of US scientists and engineers with extensive experience in cosmic-ray observations on balloons or in space, and, specifically in magnet spectroscopy, with the SMILI, P-BAR, and HEAT programs.  Significant participation from a crew of more than 10 graduate and undergraduate students forms an important educational element of the program.* [A Multiscale Approach to Magnesium Intercalation Batteries: Safer, Lighter, and Longer-Lasting](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mgy7-kmy8) - Lithium-ion batteries are the gold-standard for electrochemical energy storage; however, the ceiling for their storage potential is constrained by the most fundamental of limits: each lithium-ion only supplies one electron. Safety issues associated with lithium-ion batteries caused by uncontrollable growth of lithium-metal spikes that cause shorts the batteries and can lead to overheating and explosions of the battery as well as the flammability of many lithium-ion battery components are of great concern for the development of space technology and in particular the development of deep-space EVA suits. Broadly, my proposal is to move from lithium and towards magnesium-ion battery technology, by further developing a novel cathode material (one of only a handful in existence), Z-V2O5 which we have previously synthesized in our lab. This material is remarkable, and is capable of reversibly intercalating Mg at room temperature up to a high volumetric capacity. My primary objective is to further develop the nanostructuring of this material and optimize the battery chemistry in order to realize a fully functioning prototype magnesium-ion battery. Furthermore, I will use a variety of characterization and modeling techniques to evaluate this incredible material and inform principles for the intelligent and directed discovery of additional Mg-ion battery cathode materials. 

To accomplish these goals, I plan to utilize hydrothermal synthesis techniques coupled with structure-directing agents to optimize to optimize the nanostructuring of these materials. I plan to use a diverse palette of topochemical transformations to stabilize the desired empty host structures as well as facile techniques for chemically evaluating magnesium insertion behavior. I will quantify and evaluate the behavior of each phase using DFT+U and Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations to determine expected operating voltages and diffusion barriers. Finally, to evaluate the effects of phase segregation during magnesiation, I will utilize Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) to map electronic structure domains. 

Not only does moving from magnesium to lithium theoretically double the amount of charge per unit volume attainable in a cell, but it also allows for the use of Mg metal as an anode, eliminating the need for heavy anode components found in lithium ion batteries (Sn, C) inherently improving the weight of the overall battery. Most importantly, making the switch to magnesium makes batteries inherently safer because magnesium anodes do behave in the same way, forming metal spikes and so avoid the risk of thermal runaway. For these reasons, my proposed research addresses NASA interest in nanostructuring of cathode materials,  the development of safer batteries for human life-support systems, and the development of batteries pack more energy into lighter devices (TABS: 10.2.1.4, 3.2.1.1, and 3.2.1.4).* [Turbine Engine Performance Estimation using Particle Filters, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gsku-u4jr) - Development of a nonlinear particle filter for engine performance is proposed. The approach employs NASA high-fidelity C-MAPSS40K engine model as the central element, and addresses the issue of lack of observability of some of the engine health parameters in previous Kalman filter formulations. Proposed approach does not require linearity of the dynamics or Gaussian noise assumptions for satisfactory operation. The feasibility of real-time implementation of the proposed approach will be demonstrated using commercial, off-the-shelf General Purpose Graphical Processing Units.  Phase I feasibility demonstration will show that the particle filter formulation of the engine performance monitoring system can overcome the limitations of previously employed approaches. Phase II research will develop a prototype implementation for hardware-in-loop simulations and eventual flight test.* [An Approach to Health Management and Sustainability for Critical Aircraft Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fz6u-am26) - Impact Technologies, in collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology and its industrial partners, proposes to develop and demonstrate innovative technologies to integrate anomaly detection and failure prognosis algorithms into automated fault mitigation strategies for advanced aircraft controls. Traditional reactive fault tolerant control approaches fail to provide optimal fault mitigation over a long period of time to guarantee the integrity of the platform for the mission duration. We will create a generic simulation environment to demonstrate fault detection and progression at the component level, using electromechanical actuators as a testbench.  The proposed Anomaly Detection/Mitigation system accepts sensor inputs, extracts features from raw data and employs an anomaly detection module to determine the presence of an anomaly with performance guarantees; a prognostic routine, built on Bayesian estimation (particle filtering) techniques to estimate the remaining useful life of the component; finally, a mitigation strategy trades off between performance and control authority to extend the life of the failing component until the mission is completed. This innovative prognostics-enhanced approach to fault mitigation uses Model Predictive Control techniques running in real time. Core algorithms will be implemented on embedded systems and used in hardware-in-the-loop demonstrations.* [Doppler Lidar for Measurement of High-Altitude Aircraft Wake Vortices](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9aei-ybvm) - <p>We are developing a Doppler lidar technology for detecting and measuring wake vortices of aircraft. This lidar has been largely developed for meteorological applications, and we are exploring its adaptation to use in this aeronautics application. Wake vortex considerations are important in preventing harmful turbulence encounters in our nation's airspace.<p/><p>While ground-based Doppler lidar has been used to probe wakes of landing aircraft for many years, these lidars are of a low pulse energy (a few millijoules) that limits their use to short ranges and low altitudes within the atmospheric boundary layer. With NASA's advancement of high pulse energy (250-millijoules) lidar, aircraft wakes could now be measured at long ranges and high altitudes. A ground-based lidar could be used to measure wakes of overflying aircraft to altitudes as high at 20,000 feet. Furthermore, the high-energy lidar could be installed in an aircraft to measure the wakes of other aircraft in flight. The Airspace Systems Program (ASP) is committed to the development of Super Density Operations (SDO) concepts for NextGen. Wake vortices are a fundamental physical limitation that will need to be resolved to enable these SDOs. Understanding wake vortices is a crucial step in the path to NextGen. Under ASP, NASA's wake vortex prediction model development is world-class and is actively involved in both development and validation of these wake models. Access to previously unavailable enroute wake data that would result from this effort represents a huge opportunity to help enable the NextGen goals by providing the ability to conduct robust model validation critical to enabling SDO concepts. To start the development of measuring aircraft wakes from a distant location, we are having an aircraft fly over the lidar in such a way that the aircraft's wakes will drift over the lidar's beam. By placing the target wakes at a known location, we will capture the signal's indicative of a wake vortex. An automated algorithm could then be developed to automatically scan for and lock onto a wake vortex signature. We are also making preliminary designs of adapting the lidar's operation in an aircraft for currently-used meteorological wind measurements to wake vortex measurements. These changes are in the scan pattern of the lidar beam and signal processing.</p>* [Novel 3D C-SiC Composites for Hot Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/usch-2kaa) - Future NASA hypersonic vehicles offer a potential to incorporate advanced ceramic matrix composites (CMC).  The key characteristics include excellent mechanical properties, excellent thermal shock resistance  and ability to survive cyclic oxidation environments.  Among the CMC composites carbon fiber-SiC matrix composites offer excellent high temperature capabilities.  The highest specific strength C-SiC composites are fabricated via conventional Chemical Vapor Infiltration (CVI) SiC method.  There are several limitations to SOTA CVI SiC technology.  First, fixturing is required during the processing.  Secondly, transverse mechanical properties are quite often design limiting criteria, thirdly manufacturing times are very long and fourth the fabrication of very large parts is limited due to huge capital investments required for very large equipment needed to operate at very low pressure.  This proposal addresses all the above stated limitations of classical CVI.  First it offers unique 3-D preform capable of increasing transverse properties with minimum degeneration of the in plane properties.  Secondly the proposed processing eliminates the need of fixturing.  Thirdly, modified CVI SiC significantly reduces processing time.  And fourth, Phase II will extend to incorporate extremely novel atmospheric pressure CVI SiC, offering a paradigm shift in CVI SiC by allowing to utilize conventional, low cost atmospheric pressure furnaces routinely used in heat treating applications.* [A Diagnostic Approach for Electro-Mechanical Actuators in Aerospace Systems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sz6n-f9rn) - Electro-mechanical actuators (EMA) are finding increasing use in aerospace applications, especially with the trend towards all all-electric aircraft and spacecraft designs. However, electro-mechanical actuators still lack the knowledge base accumulated for other fielded actuator types, particularly with regard to fault detection and characterization. This paper presents a thorough analysis of some of the critical failure modes documented for EMAs and describes experiments conducted on detecting and isolating a subset of them. The list of failures has been prepared through an extensive Failure Modes and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) reference, literature review, and accessible industry experience. Methods for data acquisition and validation of algorithms on EMA test stands are described. A variety of condition indicators were developed that enabled detection, identification, and isolation among the various fault modes. A diagnostic algorithm based on an artificial neural network is shown to operate successfully using these condition indicators and furthermore, robustness of these diagnostic routines to sensor faults is demonstrated by showing their ability to distinguish between them and component failures. The paper concludes with a roadmap leading from this effort towards developing successful prognostic algorithms for electromechanical actuators.* [Integrated Health Monitoring and Fast on-Line Actuator Reconfiguration Enhancement (IHM-FLARE) System for Air Vehicles, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w67i-in5m) - SSCI proposes to develop innovative algorithms for the integration of Health Monitoring (HM) subsystem with the existing FLARE (Fast on-Line Actuator Reconfiguration Enhancement) system that achieves rapid stabilization of the closed-loop flight control system in the presence of flight-critical failures. While both systems generate on-line estimates of the failure-related paramaters, the HM system can generate false failure information, while the FLARE system may result in poor performance in subsequent flight regimes if its parameter estimates are far from their true values. The main idea is to combine the failure parameter estimates from the HM and FLARE systems to assure robustness to false alarms, missed detections and detection delays in the HM system, and to use the combined estimate in the adaptive reconfigurable control law to assure the desired closed-loop performance. In order to achieve the project objectives, we plan to carry out the following tasks in Phase I: (i) Modify F/A-18 aircraft simulation to test the feasibility of the proposed approach; (ii) Develop the IHM-FLARE architecture and algorithms; and (iii) Evaluate the performance of the flight control system under false failure information. Phase II will result in algorithm enhancements, and implementation and testing using high-fidelity and piloted F/A-18 simulations. Boeing Phantom Works (Mr. James Urnes, Sr.) will provide technical and commercialization support throughout the project.* [SMEX03 Regional Ground Soil Moisture Data: Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f3ue-xv3k) - This data set comprises gravimetric soil moisture and soil bulk density data collected during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03), which was conducted during June and July of 2003 in northern Alabama and southern Tennessee, USA.* [Cold-Lightweight Imagers for Europa (C-LIFE)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qf9r-9wh8) - Europa and other Ocean Worlds may possess extant life; sending a lander has become a high priority. Several types of imaging are needed to advance the science and operations. Cold-Lightweight Imagers for Europa (C-LIFE), is an instrument suite containing a stereoscopic color imager (SI) and a uniocular microscopic polarizing imager (MI). The SI achieves resolutions of 1 mm/pixel from a range of 3m in 3 color filters, while the MI illuminates samples with filtered LEDs and characterizes ice grains and non-ice materials down to plate scales of 10 microns/pixel. C-LIFE objectives are to: (1) Search for evidence of biomarkers and/or life, particularly with the microscopic imager; (2) Characterize surface properties and local geologic context; and (3) Guide surface activities for sample collection.

Small cameras on landed missions represent a mature technology for missions to Mars, but not in the thermal and radiation environments of Europa and other Ocean Worlds, especially given severe mass and power limitations. For example, mass and power limitations drive us to use small pixel format CMOS detectors that lack adequate testing. We expect electronics inside the shielded lander will have a high TRL, but the external camera components require development to meet the challenging requirements such as very low mass and power, radiation tolerance, and planetary protection protocols.

The University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (UA LPL) plans to propose such an instrument concept for a Europa lander and other Ocean-World landers in the future. The UA team has extensive relevant experience, including Phoenix SSI and RAC, Cassini-Huygens DISR, Mars Pathfinder IMP and, most recently, OSIRIS-REx OCAMS.  In this COLDTech effort, we advance the qualification of several key elements of C-LIFE in readiness for flight opportunities to Ocean Worlds by: (1) Developing a detector testbed capable of down-selecting candidate CMOS devices, (2) Testing CMOS detectors, filters and micro-polarizing arrays in relevant environments, (3) Measuring the refractive indices of rad-hard lenses at ocean-world temperatures, (4) Fabricating and testing a Sample Transport Mechanism to deliver samples to the MI and (5) Constructing engineering models of the MI and SI and testing in relevant environments.

We expect the key subsystems to progress from TRL 3 or 4 to TRL 5 or 6 via this proposed effort. To achieve these goals we are partnering with the Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL), which provides some key capabilities and facilities to complement those at UA. Together with our SDL partners, we will thermal and radiation test a number of promising new commercial off-the-shelf CMOS detectors to identify the best candidate for C-LIFE. We will also collaborate with industrial partners such as e2v and ONSemi for detectors, 4D Technology for micropolarimeter arrays and PIXELTEQ for filters.  Prototypes of the successful SI and MI design will be fabricated and tested under relevant environments at UA to achieve TRL 5/6.

  Increasing the technical readiness of C-LIFE directly addresses COLDTech objectives to develop and advance the maturity of science instruments focused on understanding habitability and the detection of evidence of life in the ocean worlds of the outer Solar System. Recommendations of the upcoming Europa Lander Science Definition Team Report will be folded into our design to the extent possible when the report becomes available.* [Rapid Electrochemical Detection and Identification of Microbiological and Chemical Contaminants for Manned Spaceflight Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/etez-iz7e) - &lt;p&gt;A great deal of effort has gone into the development of point-of-use methods to meet the challenge of rapid bacterial identification for both environmental monitoring and clinical applications.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, most of the methods developed rely on Preliminary Chain Reaction (PCR) and face inherent limitations because of the requirement for enzymatic components and thermal control.&amp;nbsp; Other methods based on surface plasmon resonance, quartz crystal microbalance, and fluorescence has been reported with good detection limits, but, these methods are immunological and cannot provide genetic-level information.&amp;nbsp; Further, they require labeled markers, complicated fluid handling systems, and sensitive optics that drive up cost and complexity and preclude them from outside the laboratory.&amp;nbsp; Recent work by a group at the University of Toronto has focused on developing an electrochemical platform that combines ultrasensitive detection, straightforward sample processing, and inexpensive components to create a cost-effective, user-friendly device for detection and identification of microorganisms.&amp;nbsp; The platform combines an electrical cell lysis chamber, and electrochemical reporter system, and nanostructured microelectrodes (NMEs) to detect specific nucleic acid sequences.&amp;nbsp; The nucleic acid sequences are unique to a given type of microorganism and can be used to identify the microorganisms present in a sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of the anticipated prototype device &amp;nbsp;(Lam, et al. 2012. &lt;em&gt;Polymerase Chain Reaction-Free, Sample-to-Answer Bacterial Detection in 30 Minutes with Integrated Cell Lysis&lt;/em&gt;.

The overall project will focus on optimization of the individual aspects of the detection platform in preparation for construction of a prototype for a flight experiment.&amp;nbsp; The scope of the work in this proposal is limited to characterization and optimization of the lysis step/sample preparation, probe selection, and NME structure.&amp;nbsp; Lysis conditions will be optimized by evaluating parameters associated with the oscillation frequency and lysis time for ultrasonic techniques and applied voltage for the electrochemical techniques.&amp;nbsp; Cell viability, as determined by fluorescent detection of DNA or R* [Precise Automatic Image Coregistration Tools to Enable Pixel-Level Change Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nab4-t3ug) - Automated detection of land cover changes between multitemporal images (i.e., images captured at different times) has long been a goal of the remote sensing discipline.  Most technology in this area has focused on methods for detecting and identifying land cover or surface object changes in two or more images, but precise co-registration of images remains a key challenge. In fact, image-to-image registration and image-based change detection are intricately related, as the success of conducting both relies on the precision of the other; software that supports these functions should do so in an integrative manner. Image registration is the key factor influencing the success of detecting land cover changes at or near pixel scale.  We will develop tools in the form of a "software development kit" (SDK) specifically optimized for precise co-registration of two or more images with minimal user interaction, with the primary motivation to enable change detection algorithms to focus on salient changes rather than highlight image registration errors.  The SDK will be available to NASA at no cost, after which we will build user applications based on the SDK for commercial offering.* [Advanced Physical Models and Numerical Algorithms to Enable High-Fidelity Aerothermodynamic Simulations of Planetary Entry Vehicles on Emerging Distributed Heterogeneous Computing Architectures](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9jg2-fj2y) - The design and qualification of entry systems for planetary exploration largely rely on computational simulations. However, state-of-the-art modeling capabilities introduce substantial limitations in providing accurate and reliable predictions for aerothermodynamic flow environments of such entry, decent, and landing vehicles. These challenges are attributed to (i) the complexity of coupled multiphysical processes; (ii) limited experimental data for model validation; and (iii) the absence of advanced numerical algorithms and physical models for the accurate and efficient simulation of aerothermodynamic flows. By addressing these issues, the overall objective of this research is the development of advanced high-order numerical methods and high-fidelity physical models for the reliable prediction of aerothermodynamic flows that are relevant to hypersonic and atmospheric entry vehicles. Novel programming paradigms will be used for accelerating multiphysics simulation codes on emerging heterogeneous computing architectures. Combined, these modeling capabilities will provide improved predictions of heat-transfer, particle-laden reacting flows, and hypersonic environments to support the development of next-generation entry, descent, and landing systems.* [Tensegrital Wheel for Enhanced Surface Mobility, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gavm-dr2f) - ProtoInnovations introduces the "tensegrital wheel" an inventive concept for wheeled locomotion that exploits the geometric and mechanical attributes of a tensegrity structure to engage with the terrain in an effective and efficient manner. The tensegrital wheel emulates the behavior of a variable pressure tire without the need for an inflation system. The construction of the tensegrital wheel is such that it absorbs and diffuses ground forces fairly evenly. The stiffness of the tensegrital wheel can be tuned to match the demands of a given environment that the wheel is to operate in or can be adjusted on-the-fly. These attributes allow for better adaptation to the terrain thus increasing the amount of thrust that can be generated at the wheel/ground interface, and improving a vehicle's dynamic response and obstacle negotiation abilities. We assert that the tensegrital wheel can be designed to achieve a very high strength-to-weight ratio and exceptional capacity for long-life specifically in the context of planetary exploration. For the Phase I of this SBIR project we aim to prove the feasibility of the tensegrital wheel and quantify its capabilities and limitations through analysis, prototyping, and testing.  The technology proposed here is of particular value to planetary missions involving mobility over various terrain geometries and ground compositions.* [Adverse event detection, monitoring, and evaluation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bcbg-ye6c) - This SBIR project delivers a single-sensor structural health-monitoring (SHM) system that uses the impedance method to monitor structural integrity, wave propagation methods to assess surfaces, and acoustic SHM to detect adverse events (impacts). This Adverse Event Detection (AED) unit supports nondestructive evaluation (NDE) systems and evaluates advanced composite structures.
Implications of the innovation
Increasingly demanding weight and performance needs encourage widespread use of composite materials. New systems are needed to detect incipient flaws in composites before damage becomes critical. Health analyzers that actively examine structures across several length and time scales in an autonomous fashion greatly reduce the number of sensors required and lower system complexity and cost; however, no practical system exists. We address this deficiency by building on our existing SHM system.
Technical objectives
AED leverages our previous NASA SHM research. Our initial Phase 1 prototype takes the form of a single custom printed circuit board, and is a TRL 5 unit. We have demonstrated both the impedance method and wave propagation SHM as implemented by a single sensor. Phase 1 will focus on performing similar demonstrations for acoustic SHM using the same single sensor element.
Research description
We have established feasibility for a chip-level approach that combines the impedance method and wave propagation, and demonstrated damage detection on a model composite. Phase 1 will validate chip-level feasibility for acoustic operation, and demonstrate this additional capability in a laboratory prototype.
Anticipated results
Phase 1 attacks the problem of monitoring structural integrity across multiple time and distance scales and completes a TRL 5 prototype that can be deployed wirelessly. Phase 2 delivers a TRL 6 unit that autonomously senses damage across several length and time scales by integrating impedance based, wave propagation, and acoustic SHM.* [Wearable Beat to Beat Blood Pressure Monitor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/izxw-8qga) - A key component of NASA's human exploration programs is a system that monitors the health of the crew during the space missions. The wearable physiological monitor proposed by Linea Research Corporation can be used to continuously observe the beat to beat blood pressure. The monitor can be used to observe the physiological effect of various countermeasures against prolonged exposures to reduced gravitational environments. The proposed device will allow the monitoring of the pharmacological effect on blood pressure over prolonged periods. Currently, beat to beat monitoring of blood pressure is done primarily in hospital settings through invasive procedures involving percutaneous insertion of catheters into the radial or brachial arteries. While non-invasive beat to beat blood pressures based on either the Penaz method or arterial applanation tonometry are currently available, they each have limitations. In addition, all monitors are based on large stationary equipment that requires the subject to be immobile. Successful implementation of the proposed program will result in an accurate wearable beat to beat blood pressure measurement.* [Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) as an Analogue of Post-flight Sensorimotor Dysfunction](https://data.nasa.gov/d/aisg-3uje) - Aim 1A (complete): Tolerance to GVS. Dilda, V, MacDougall HG, Moore, ST. Tolerance to extended Galvanic vestibular stimulation: optimal exposure for astronaut training. Aviat Space Environ Med. 2011 82:770-774.     
Aim 1B (complete): Cognitive effects of GVS. Dilda, V, MacDougall HG, Curthoys IS, Moore, ST. (2012) Effects of Galvanic vestibular stimulation on cognitive function. Exp Brain Res, 216:275-285.    
Aim 2 (complete): GVS as an analog of post-flight spatial disorientation. Moore ST, Dilda V, MacDougall HG (2011) Galvanic vestibular stimulation as an analog of spatial disorientation after spaceflight. Aviat Space Environ Med, 82; 535-542.     
Aim 3 (complete): Adaptation to repeated exposures to GVS. Postural and locomotor function recovered in an exponential pattern over 12 weeks of weekly 10-min GVS exposures, and this improvement was maintained at week 18 and 36 follow-ups. The exponential pattern of postural recovery was similar to that observed in shuttle astronauts post-flight. GVS adaptation did not occur at the vestibular end-organs or involve changes in low-level vestibulo-ocular or vestibulo-spinal reflexes. Faced with unreliable vestibular input, the CNS reweighted sensory input to emphasize veridical somatosensory and visual information to regain postural and locomotor function. After a period of recovery subjects exhibited dual adaptation and the ability to rapidly switch between the perturbed and natural vestibular state for up to 6 months, analogous to veteran astronauts. GVS trained subjects performed significantly better than untrained controls (p=0.01) on a visuomotor task in a full motion simulator during unpredictable motion, suggesting a protective effect of GVS exposure in novel vestibular environments.* [Self-Regulating Capillary Flow Networks for Electrospray Micropropulsion Devices](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gjvy-wsq2) - Advances in miniaturization of electronics and MEMS devices enable microsatellites and CubeSats to perform tasks that previously required massive satellites. Low launch costs of these microsatellites will make existing applications cheaper and revolutionize access to space, leading to an explosion of diversity in orbital systems. But a reliable micropropulsion system is needed to allow CubeSats to perform the same orbital maneuvers as traditional satellites, and even be used for swarming and deep-space missions.

One promising technology is electrospray micropropulsion. Traditional large-scale electrospray propulsion induces an electric field with a negative electrode above the surface of a conductive propellant, causing emission of ions or droplets. It has been tested successfully in space on the LISA Pathfinder mission. Electrospray micropropulsion miniaturizes this technology; the thrusters are so small and light that you could easily fit five or six in the palm of your hand. A leading design is external-flow microfluidic electrospray propulsion (MEP).

Emission technology is advancing steadily, but a key roadblock is the development of a propellant management device (PMD) to regulate flow from storage to the emitters. The laws of fluid dynamics prevent large-scale PMDs with their pumps, valves, and pipes from working at the micro scale. Development of effective micro PMDs is the final technological step required for the electrospray micropropulsion. We propose a novel self-healing microfluidic PMD, and the results of our research will be easily adaptable to other microfluidic projects such as lab-on-a-chip devices for extraplanetary or medical uses, focus beam spectrometers, electron microscopes, and milling devices. 

An earlier approach to micro PMDs relied on internal wicking, precluding fine control of the design or self-regulatory flow characteristics. Our proposed PMD will consistently and robustly feed propellant to the emitter, automatically adjust for varying emitter conditions, self-heal and resist perturbations, and avoid clogging. This can be accomplished by using external wicking instead of internal flow.

Although internal and external capillary wicking are both related to surface tension, they are fundamentally different processes. Internal wicking (flow through a narrow pipe) is well understood. The enclosure forces the flux to be constant in space, so the fluid dynamics are governed by a single parameter (the distance the fluid has wicked) and local flow control is impossible.

	External wicking (capillary flow with a free surface, e.g. in a groove) is not well understood, but its complexity increases the possibilities for flow control. The existence of a free surface allows flux and local pressure to vary dynamically. And external groove flow is automatically self-healing: fluid avoids regions with too much propellant and flows to underfilled regions, making it a natural fit for PMDs.

	External flow is also controllable. Unlike internal flow, the free surface can couple both to the geometry of the substrate and external electromagnetic fields; hence flow can be precisely controlled at every point from start to end. This potential for extremely fine fluid control is not trivial; the highly nonlinear partial differential equations governing the dynamics are very difficult to solve. But with thorough analysis and numerical modeling, the power of free surface control can be unlocked.

We have proposed designing an external-flow PMD specifically for the MEP. But rather than stop at designing a single PMD for a particular application, we also propose developing a comprehensive analytical and computational toolkit for self-regulating external flow networks. This toolkit will contain analogues of electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) so that fluid management systems for various situations can quickly and easily be developed by considering analogous electronic circuitry.* [Robust Multicore Middleware, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9khk-yp7b) - Current and emerging spaceflight processors are leveraging heterogeneous multicore/co-processor architectures to satisfy the ever increasing onboard processing demands required by planned NASA missions. These architectures can provide increased processing bandwidth, power efficiency, and fault tolerance for onboard processing applications. However, these advantages come at the cost of increased hardware and software complexity. As software development is a major cost driver for missions, this increased complexity has the potential to significantly increase cost for future missions. To address this risk, Troxel Aerospace Industries, Inc. proposes to develop a robust middleware management technology for spacecraft-focused multicore/co-processor architectures. The proposed middleware technology will enable a fault tolerant computing environment that is agnostic to the underlying hardware and is largely transparent to mission applications executing upon the middleware to provide a standardized, intelligent resource, fault, and power management interface.* [Application of Advanced Electromagnetic Arrays to High Efficiency, High Bandwidth, Redundant Linear Actuators, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y6b7-884p) - The proposed SBIR effort will employ a systems approach to develop motor/controller/screw element systems adequate for demanding launch thrust vector control and control surface actuator applications.  This approach will utilize high bandwidth, high efficiency, redundant motor systems coupled with appropriately paired motor controls.   The actuator system will consist of a high efficiency permanent magnet motor with a high number of current channels for system redundancy, an H-bridge based controller with a high number of parallel current channels and sufficient current capability to enable high system response, and conventional screw-based linear actuator elements.  The linear actuation elements will be designed with corrosion resistance, increased resistance to nut jamming, and inherent features preventing incorrect installation of the device.  These innovations are necessary to overcome the inherent limitations of today's actuator systems, which were developed based on the limitations of traditional motors, power electronics, and available actuator hardware. Phase I of this project will focus on the design requirements, key features, and suggested solutions for thrust vector control actuator systems.  The Phase II portion of the project will deliver a working prototype actuator.* [NUE - Novel Universal Ensemble Capability for Overset Grids, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3p4d-jr42) - Intelligent Light makers of the FieldView CFD/CAE Post-processing tool, proposes to develop NUE (pronounced noo-ae) - a Novel and Universal capability that manages an Ensemble of overset grid tools. NUE's assembly, flow solver and post-processing components accept grids from ANY grid generation package of ANY grid type to facilitate the ease of use of the overset grid methodology. Its components are coupled through an API or a Python Software Interface Framework (SIF) and utilize a standardized output based upon an extended version of pyCGNS. The Grid Assembly utilizes components from FieldView via a python wrapped server process that allows the user to launch grid assembly, flow solvers and to detect flaws in the overset grid system such as orphans points or by using FieldView advanced post-processing features to identify regions in need of grid refinement. FieldView can then create objects, such as CAD Surfaces, which the user can readily load into their grid generator to assist in overset grid modification or refinement. The user would be able to launch the flowsolver from within FieldView and then have automated reports available in a browser window. NUE represents a novel and standardized capability that allows all the components of the overset ensemble of tools to interact in a consistent manner - reducing the overall time that practitioners must spend in managing their simulations.* [An Affordable Autonomous Hydrogen Flame Detection System for Rocket Propulsion, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fmgw-qj3u) - NASA has long used liquid hydrogen as a fuel and plans to continue using it in association with their advanced nuclear thermal propulsion technology. Hydrogen fire detection is critical for rocket propulsion safety and maintenance. A significant fire at a rocket test or launch facility could be catastrophic to infrastructure or even worse, to human life. Detection monitoring is problematic as hydrogen flames can be nearly invisible during the day. Non-imaging, non-visible fire detection technology has limited range and can suffer from false alarms from sources outside the region of interest. Low-cost visible imagers, commonly used for wide-scale routine surveillance, have limited utility detecting hydrogen fires. Although it has been known for decades that multispectral imaging outside the visible range can be used to detect fires with low false alarm rates, the price of such systems and the lack of processing algorithms and the ability to implement them in real-time has largely prohibited their use. During this project we will develop a low-cost imaging capability that fuses data collected from sensors operating in the (1) solar blind ultra-violet, (2) thermal infrared and (3) visible spectrum, using advanced spectral, spatial and temporal processing techniques optimized to detect and generate alerts associated with hydrogen fires in real-time. This multi-sensor, multi-processing approach will enable us to automate flame detection with extremely low false alarm rates. In addition to control room alerts, we will make use of the wireless communication capabilities found within smart phones and other mobile devices to build an App to alert key decision makers and first responders of a fire detected in real-time. This multi-sensor imaging research could also support NASA's important cool flame microgravity research occurring on the International Space Station.* [Software Bus Network Message Routing Protocol](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sqvw-9nbz) - <p>The Software Bus Network (SBN) is a software application that enables seamless flight software communication between multiple processors or spacecraft.&nbsp; The SBN is an application that depends on the Core Flight Software (CFS) developed by Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).&nbsp; A version of the SBN application currently exists, but is limited by the fact that processors or spacecraft must be directly connected in order to make use of the SBN.&nbsp; This effort proposes to remove that limitation by implementing a router capability that will be able to send messages between processors or spacecraft that are not directly connected by relaying them through intermediate nodes.</p><p>The Core Flight Software (CFS) is a framework of reusable flight software services and applications.&nbsp; A key component of the CFS is a message bus that allows different software applications to send messages to one another using a publish/subscribe method.&nbsp; The message bus connects applications that are running on the same processor.&nbsp; As flight software becomes more complex, it becomes necessary to use multiple processors or even multiple spacecraft.&nbsp; The Software Bus Network (SBN) application makes it easier to use CFS software on multiple processors or spacecraft by providing a way for applications to communicate over a variety of interfaces.&nbsp; The SBN acts as a kind of bridge between the message buses on different processors.&nbsp; This allows communication to take place in a way that is transparent to all of the other software applications being used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>* [Data driven modeling of the simultaneous activities in ambient environments](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nazp-bdea) - Resident of a smart home, who may be an old person or an Alzheimer patient needing permanent assistance, actuates the world by realizing activities, which are observed through the embedded sensors of smart home. Typically, this person may sometimes forget completion of the activities; may realize the activities of daily living incorrectly, and may enter to dangerous states. In order to provide automatic assistance for the smart home resident through the embedded electronically controllable actuators and make the smart home resident able to live independently at home we propose to calculate a possibilistic logical space for correct realization of activities, which may be represented in form of a multivariable problem. Regardless from the physical entity (modality and location) of the intelligence source and the quantity of individuals who perform the activities; per each possible goal or activity, we consider a unique source of intelligence (for example a social mind) who directs the order of fuzzy events that occur in the ambient environment, then the plan behind world actuations is modeled applying extensions of the fuzzy logic. The main key point that we deal with is the analysis of the observations in order to make inferences about possible simultaneous activities that may be planned and realized by one or more individuals; so that we can reason in the cases the parallel activities are interrupted.* [Modeling of Activities as Fuzzy Temporal Multivariable Problems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hyv5-k2pu) - Smart Home resident may be an Alzheimer patient needing continuous assistance and care giving. Because of forgetfulness, this person may realize activities of daily living erroneously. In order to assist this person automatically in Smart Home, all his performed actions and activities are observed through the embedded sensors of Smart Home, and applying the data mining techniques his activities are analyzed. Then information about his activities is provided and in the consequence, comparing learned correct patterns and current observations the Smart Home may infer provision of assistance to this person at the appropriate moment. In this paper we propose a data-driven activity modeling approach, which supports reasoning in correct realization of the activities. Activities are presumed as the series of fuzzy events that occur shortly one after another. Per each activity, we calculate a fuzzy conceptual structure, and the model of activity is represented in form of a multivariable problem.* [Lunar Health Monitor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/crmd-cpcq) - Orbital Research has successfully demonstrated a dry electrode (no electrolyte or gel required) for heart rate and ECG monitoring.  Preliminary data has indicated that the electrode can be incorporated into a garment that does not require an adhesive for successful data collection.  Further preliminary data indicates that respiration rate can be deduced from the ECG waveform captured from the dry electrodes. The Orbital Lunar Health Monitor (LHM) will incorporate the patented dry electrode with other commercially available sensors in a garment resulting in fully wearable monitor of Astronaut Health.  The data from each of the sensor is processed, yielding a comprehensive image of overall health. Environment sensors are also incorporated to detect longer term health threats.  The LHM is comfortable and non-inhibiting. The Orbital Lunar Health Monitor is intended to enable continuous monitoring of health status of Astronauts both in  intra- and extra-vehicular sorties.* [NACP Regional: National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Aggregated Gridded Model Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/stn9-87jb) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides two products that were derived from the recently published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis 1-degree terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs (Gridded 1-deg Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et al., 2013). The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional Synthesis - Description of Observations and Models.* [Rapid Development of Flight Software for a Complete Guidance, Navigation, and Control Subsystem Using Simulinkâs Auto-coding Capabilities](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8yqb-e8h3) - <p>The proposed task will create new processes and tools for automatically generating flight code for the entire Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) subsystem&nbsp;using the approach of&nbsp;translating GNC models generated by commercially available modeling and simulation tool(s) into multiple&nbsp;software applications for&nbsp;the standard&nbsp;flight software (FSW) architecture used by the Goddard Space Flight Center.

Anxiety-Management Countermeasure](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9rgt-r3c9) - <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
                      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<p>1. Original Project aims/objectives: Stress and anxiety-related
  problems are some of the most common and costly behavioral health
  problems in society. For those working in operational environments
  (i.e., astronauts, flight controllers, military), stress and
  anxiety-related problems before, during, or after missions can
  seriously compromise efficiency, safety, and performance. To address
  behavioral health issues like stress, it is important to maximize the
  privacy, validity, and acceptability of the countermeasures used. Our
  project had two specific aims: 1) to develop an evidence-based,
  autonomous, multimedia program to train users to manage stress and
  build resilience; 2) to evaluate the program in a randomized
  controlled trial (RCT). The program is called SMART-OP (Stress
  Management and Resilience Training for Optimal Performance). The
  six-session cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based program includes
  education about stress, and interactive training exercises that teach
  users to monitor stress, regulate emotions and relax, think flexibly,
  be realistic, and take effective action to deal with stressors. The
  content of the program can be modified to target different populations
  who work in challenging environments (e.g., astronauts, military, and
  flight controllers) and could be disseminated widely via computer,
  tablet, or smartphone. 2. Key Findings: We recently evaluated SMART-OP
  in an RCT with a sample of stressed but otherwise healthy University
  of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Law and Business School students
  (N=66). SMART-OP was compared to an attention control (AC) group that
  received marketed stress management information (i.e., videos and
  reading material). Interested participants were screened to ensure
  they met study eligibility criteria (no medical or psychiatric
  conditions, were stressed based on a self-report stress score, and a
  UCLA graduate student). Two hundred and thirty individuals expressed
  interest in the study, 169 were screened, and 80 were eligible.
  Participants (N = 66) were randomized to SMART-OP or AC and were
  evaluated on self-report measures and performance on The Trier Social
  Stress Test (TSST). Participants also evaluated the program for
  usefulness and usability. Fifty-nine participants completed all
  training sessions and assessments. The SMART-OP group reported
  significantly less stress, more perceived control over stress, and
  rated the program as significantly more useful than the AC group.
  During the TSST, the SMART-OP group showed a more adaptive within-task
  recovery at post-assessment based on a-amylase data (a biomarker of
  stress). SMART-OP received an excellent score on a measure of
  usability. 3. Impact of key findings on hypotheses, technology
  requirements, objectives, and specific aims of the original proposal:
  Our RCT key findings indicate that SMART-OP is highly usable and is a
  more effective and useful stress management training program than an
  educational comparison. These findings support our initial hypotheses
  that the self-guided interactive multimedia stress management and
  resilience training program would be a useful and acceptable method of
  training to the user, and an effective stress management
  countermeasure. Our findings are consistent with the growing
  literature on technology-based behavioral health interventions which
  report that such programs are effective and acceptable forms of
  treatment. SMART-OP only requires a computer for use so it can be used
  confidentially at a time and place of the user's choosing. The program
  can also be modified for use by nearly any population as well as
  tablet or smartphone platforms. We also met our two main aims and
  objectives of our original proposal-- to develop an evidence-based
  autonomous,* [Biosensors for Exploration Medical System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/78hr-6r2q) - The current International Space Station (ISS) ECG (electrocardiogram) system for donning the biomedical sensors is time consuming and inconvenient, requiring shaving, application of electrodes, and signal checks. A more efficient ECG system will save crew time and reduce the overhead of stowing additional supplies. Additionally, the current ECG hardware requires dedicated ISS power and significant volume, but advances in microelectronics has significantly reduced the volume and power required for ECG applications.  The Biosensors-EMSD (Exploration Medical System Demonstration) will demonstrate the integration of small, battery powered, easy to use biomedical sensors and data acquisition devices that will have the ability to measure, store, and transmit physiologic parameters during operational and ambulatory scenarios.    
Specific Aims:     
1. Demonstrate that commercial off the shelf (COTS) and emerging technologies satisfy exploration physiological monitoring requirements and operational requirements    
2. Reduce the time required of an on-orbit crew and ground personnel to store, access, transfer, and process physiological data    
3. Provide a mechanism for interfacing biomedical sensor technology with a common data management framework and architecture to enable the EMSD objectives.    
The functionality of the ECG system will be verified through a ground demonstration and an ISS flight demonstration, both as part of the Exploration Medical System Demonstration.  The project will begin with a market survey of available COTS ECG systems that meet physiological monitoring requirements followed by a direct COTS procurement.  The ECG system will then be tested and verified for proper capabilities by CMO analogs.  Ground testing will require CMO analogs to don the ECG system and execute a series of predetermined tasks while a variety of ECG data and video is collected.  ECG data and video will be examined to ensure data quality, appropriate data routing, and to demonstrate system efficiency.  Flight testing will be similar to ground testing, but may not be as comprehensive given in-flight resource limitations.  The availability of more varied medical condition simulations, more extensive supply of power, fewer time and space limitations, and enhanced system characterization capabilities will allow the ground demonstration to expand the on-orbit objectives by assessing system effectiveness and performance.* [Autonomous Melt-Probe Penetration of Dirty Ice with Clean Sampling for Life Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c7pf-2ivu) - Access to subsurface material and oceans through water-ice crusts is a goal common to exploration of all ocean worlds. Probes that melt their way through ice are, thus far, the only technology demonstrated to penetrate ice autonomously to depths on the order of kilometers, as will be required to reach an ocean on, e.g., Europa. Moreover, melt probes operate in ice at all relevant temperatures, with internal temperatures for electronics and instrumentation near 273K. Such probes are thus strong candidates for subsurface access and life detection on ocean worlds.

However, an ocean worlds melt probe will have to penetrate ice laden with particulates from, e.g., meteoritic or comet dust infall, which accumulate in front of the probe, insulate the melt head, and arrest progress. At the same time, the probe must acquire melt- or ocean-water samples and deliver them without contamination to life-detection instruments. These functions must be accomplished under more severe constraints on power (in foreseeable landed systems) than previous melt probes can meet.

Melt probe power requirements decrease rapidly with decreasing size. We show that a probe with dimensions near those of our small, newly field-tested probe could attain meter-per-hour descent speeds on ocean worlds, even at 100K temperature, using thermal power comparable to that generated radiogenically in a General Purpose Heat Source. Such speeds are sufficient to reach kilometers-deep subglacial water within a nominal 30-day lander life time.

Such an approach would entail major commitments of engineering effort and national resources of plutonium. Precisely because the commitments would be large, it is critical to establish first that essential, component-level functions of subsurface exploration can actually be demonstrated in sufficiently small probes. Primary technical risks on a path to flight hardware therefore entail simplification and size-reduction of hardware to penetrate ‘dirty’ ice, and to acquire ‘clean’ samples for life-detection. The objective of this project is retirement of those risks.

We bring to this work unique experience in each component. Two members of our team have developed a simple, robust probe, which has reached 400 m depth in Greenland and demonstrated penetration rates of 6.6 meters per hour (these are the second-greatest depth and highest speed achieved by melt probes on Earth to date). We have demonstrated autonomous descent based on the geometry and power-balance in our probe, rather than computationally intensive control algorithms. Our third team member has developed and tested in Antarctica a melt-probe based, microbiologically and geochemically clean sampling system, the size and complexity of which we will reduce.

Our specific objectives are thus: (1) to develop a simplified pump and jetting mechanism (currently TRL 3), integrate it with our field-tested melt probe (TRL 4), and to quantify in the laboratory, the characteristics of particle-laden ice that the system can penetrate as a function of jetting parameters; (2) to develop, initially also in the laboratory, clean acquisition and transfer of water samples (currently TRL 3-4 based on Antarctic field experience); and finally (3) to demonstrate dirty ice penetration and clean sampling in an integrated system small enough to be powered radiogenically on ocean worlds, and in a relevant environment (to a depth of 50 m on a dusty alpine glacier in Washington State, with our exit TRL at or approaching TRL 5).

We presently envision the next step toward mission implementation to be testing in ice simulating that on ocean-worlds surface at relevant temperatures. We are in active conversation with the JPL Space Technology Program Office on mission implementation.* [STARwatch to Deliver Objective Sleep Measures for Spaceflight Operations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8frb-eu93) - This project will achieve a wrist-worn actigraphy device called STARwatch, designed specifically for space exploration environments. It will provide a minimally obtrusive, objective measure that evaluates astronaut sleep-wake activity and light exposure. This project will leverage our second generation actigraphy device that has already been validated in controlled laboratory experiments against gold-standard polysomnography. The compact wrist-worn device includes sensors to collect sleep metrics and will also serve as a wireless hub to collect real-time physiological data from other body-worn sensors (e.g., heart rate, EEG). It will use standardized wireless communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth) to automatically uplink data to the ISS network (no astronaut time required). Data will automatically be integrated into medical operations support systems (e.g., BHP-Dashboard) to provide immediate feedback to astronauts and flight surgeons to aid in decision-making relative to astronaut medical, behavioral health and performance issues. During Phase I, we will develop an enhanced STARwatch, integrate data from other body worn sensors (e.g., heart rate sensor), demonstrate automatic data streaming using approaches compatible with the ISS network environment, and develop a plan for operational validation and spaceflight certification that will be implemented during Phase II (Phase I TRL of 4-5).* [Non-Invasive Transcranial Doppler Sonogram Device for Detection of Embolic Air in Cerebral Arteries, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2bpv-jz6p) - Technology is needed to provide real-time assessment and evaluation of hematological parameters during prolong space flights and planetary missions.  A key hematological parameter is the monitoring and measurement of emboli in the brain especially during Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) on planetary surfaces as well as orbital flights. A non-invasive, compact Transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurement device will provide monitoring of flight crew blood physiology during extended duration missions and deliver this data to onboard flight surgeons.  

To address this need, GeneXpress Informatics (GXI) and Leonid Bunegin and Dr. Claudia S. Miller of the University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSC) at San Antonio proposes to develop a non-invasive, portable TCD sonogram based diagnostic system for real-time monitoring and detection of cerebral artery air embolisms.   The detection system uses intensity audio signals and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to detect and locate the TCD audio signals of air bubbles in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). 

In Phase I, GXI proposes to develop and demonstrate the non-invasive use TCD measurements for the determination of air emboli.  In Phase II, GXI will proceed to a prototype development which will include construction and fabrication of a handheld field portable frequency-domain TCD measurement system.* [Drill Embedded Nanosensors for Planetary Subsurface Exploration](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q4uy-cbfr) - <p>We have developed a carbon nanotube (CNT) sensor for water vapor detection under Martian Conditions and the miniaturized electronics can be embedded in the drill bit for collecting sensor data and transmitting it to a computer wirelessly. This capability will enable the real time measurement of ice during drilling. With this real time and in-situ measurement, subsurface ice detection can be easy, fast, precise and low cost.<p/><p>Current methods for sensing icy deposits on Mars or the moon include volume hydrogen measurements in a 1m3 volume from a surface neutron spectrometer, optical spectral measurements to identify water spectral lines, or direct analysis of samples using mass spectroscopy. The latter two methods require samples to be on the surface or fed into an instrument. The detection limit of optical spectroscopy is ~1% water ice in a cuttings mixture. In contrast CNT sensor's detection limit is 10-6 – 10-9 and the sensors are tiny with significantly lower power usage compared to other instruments. The drill mounted CNT sensor can also detect ice as it is encountered by the drill bit at very low concentrations, obtaining fine scale information on the vertical structure of the icy material. Potentially, CNT sensors combined with drilling afford a new approach for detection and measurement of volatiles. With CIF support in 2013, we started with CNT sensors that operate under Earth conditions optimized to sense organic volatiles and developed a CNT sensor capable of detecting water vapor, requiring special coatings applied to the CNT.  We characterized the sensor performance under Mars pressure (~6mbar) and temperature (-45oC) conditions, showing that it could detect small quantities of water vapor introduced into its vicinity. We compared our CNT sensor with commercially available RH sensors. The test results show that commercial sensors do not work under vacuum conditions. So, our CNT sensors exceed the performance of these commercial sensors for Martian conditions.   We miniaturized the sensor, and constructed data acquisition and wireless communication electronics to fit inside a drill string.  The wireless communications allows us to transmit the CNT sensor signal from the borehole without bringing wires through the rotating interface. We then constructed a simulated borehole and drill string and tested sensor performance detecting small quantities of water vapor under Martian conditions. The wireless communication board can transmit the sensor data to a USB receiver plugged into a computer for data streaming. The work remaining is to complete sensor installation into a drill string and test it drilling into icy material in a Mars environment, which requires a Mars chamber that requires use of unique Mars drill testing facilities at Honeybee Robotics.  Possible applications of CNT sensors for water detection include prospecting for buried ice on the Moon, and characterizing feedstocks for ISRU on the moon or Mars.  An ISRU demonstration proposal to the Mars 2020 rover has expressed interest.  CNT borehole instruments that detect volatiles like methane should interest the fuels industry.</p>* [High Efficiency Hybrid Energy Storage Utilizing High Power Density Ultracapacitors For Long Duration Balloon Flights, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gieh-iq9z) - FastCAP proposes to develop an ultra-high power density and high frequency ultracapacitor capable of surviving over the wide temperature range of -60C to 130C and exhibiting peak gravimetric and volumetric power density of 120kW/kg and 150kW/L respectively. FastCAP is planning to design and prototype a hybrid system comprised of the proposed ultracapacitor in parallel with a high energy density, rechargeable, lithium ion battery showing at least 50% volume reduction and 100% lifetime increase compared to stand-alone lithium batteries, meeting long duration research balloon requirements. During Phase I, FastCAP will evaluate both novel under-development and off-the-shelf lithium chemistries utilized in aerospace applications. The resulting hybrid battery-ultracapacitor (HBU) system combines the benefits of both technologies and will meet NASA's scientific balloon requirements of energy density, power density, shelf life, temperature, reliability and cycle life. This ultracapacitor can also be coupled to a piezoelectric generator, thanks to a high cut off frequency greater than 500Hz. The proposed HBU system will enable significant improvements in the design of power storage for terrestrial and planetary balloons, reducing their weight, volume, and complexity, while improving performance and relaxing design constraints on scarce candidate battery technologies. Compared to today's high-rate reserve and rechargeable battery technologies, the proposed hybrid system will provide much higher power and higher energy density, show tremendous improvement in cycle lifetime, and show reduced risk of explosion and thermal runaway associated with high-rate discharge, thanks to the power buffering role of the ultracapacitor within the HBU system. In applications where batteries are currently oversized for power handling, dramatic reductions in total energy storage system weight will be achieved by complementing those batteries with ultracapacitors.* [MOPITT Gridded Daily CO Retrievals (Thermal Infrared Radiances) V006](https://data.nasa.gov/d/emms-45mp) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals.

These AVHRR data contain two main sets of data: site extracts of SAFARI core sites (Mongu, Etosha, Kasungu, Maun, Skukuza, and Tshane), and regional 15-day composites from sets of single-day images. These AVHRR data contain four main sets of data:1.5 km daily site extracts of SAFARI core sites (2000)1.5 km 15-day composites of SAFARI core sites (1998-2000)1.5 km 15-day composites of the southern African region (Mar, Sept 2000)6 km 15-day composites of the southern African region (1998-2000)The primary data layers for site extracts and regional composites are fire pixel counts and maximum NDVI. The fire product is different for the daily and for the composited products (see readme file) and a fire product is not included in the 1.5 km regional data set.  NDVI composite-associated data layers for the regional data sets include land surface temperature, reflectance, solar zenith angle, view zenith angle, and relative azimuth angle. NDVI composite-associated data layers for the site extracts include these same variables as well as brightness temperature, fire mask composite, latitude, and longitude. The data are stored in binary image format files. There is a metadata file for each site and date/compositing period, in ASCII format.* [Poverty Mapping Project: Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gte3-q924) - The Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition dataset consists of estimates of the 

percentage of children with weight-for-age z-scores that are more than two standard deviations below the median of the NCHS/CDC/WHO 

International Reference Population. Data are reported for the most recent year with subnational information available at the time of 

development. The data products include a shapefile (vector data) of percentage rates, grids (raster data) of rates (per thousand in 

order to preserve precision in integer format), the number of children under five (the rate denominator), and the number of 

underweight children under five (the rate numerator), and a tabular dataset of the same and associated data. This dataset is produced 

by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [PHOBOS 2 MARS TERMOSCAN THERMAL/VISIBLE IMAGING EDR V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n5eg-j4iz) - In February and March, 1989, the Termoskan instrument on board the Phobos '88 spacecraft of the USSR acquired a limited set of very high resolution simultaneous observations of the reflected solar flux (hereafter referred to as the visible channel) and emitted thermal flux (thermal infrared (IR)) from Mars's equatorial region. These are, so far, the highest spatial resolution thermal data ever obtained for Mars. Four slightly overlapping thermal panoramas (also called scans or swaths) cover a large portion of the equatorial region from 30 deg.S to 6 deg.N latitude. Simultaneous visible panoramas were taken during each of the four observing sessions; due to spacecraft memory limitations, visible channel processing was stopped early relative to the thermal channel for 2 of the sessions (2 and 4). Thus, the visible channel panoramas are shorter than the thermal panoramas for these sessions. These data are saved for historical reasons; they are not considered to be of archival quality.* [Distributed Leak Detection System Using Structure-Borne Noise, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jz98-3stw) - Manned spacecraft are vulnerable to air leaks caused by micrometeorite
and space debris impact.  The ability to detect and quickly locate and
mitigate a pressure vessel breach is critical to the safety of any long
duration spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or a
proposed lunar base or mission to Mars.  Current NASA protocol for
finding a spacecraft leak uses a handheld ultrasonic directional
microphone, similar to those widely deployed industrially, to detect the
40 kHz airborne ultrasonic hiss generated by the downstream leak
turbulence.  However, known limitations exist regarding the use of
airborne ultrasonic emissions for locating leaks in the spacecraft
environment because the downstream side of the leak occurs into the
vacuum of space, creating reduced leak noise inside the pressure vessel.
Blockages of the transmission of airborne ultrasonic energy by
structural components, avionics, and equipment racks also limit the
detection range of such systems.  An alternative approach that we
propose is to monitor the spacecraft structure itself---the pressure
vessel skin---for leak-generated surface-borne ultrasound by means of a
flexible and modular electronics package with fully integrated surface
sensor arrays, data acquisition electronics, and radio frequency
communication capabilities.* [Plug Load Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q9cy-stcj) - We provide MATLAB binary files (.mat) and comma separated values files of data collected from a pilot study of a plug load management system that allows for the metering and control of individual electrical plug loads. The study included 15 power strips, each containing 4 channels (receptacles), which wirelessly transmitted power consumption data approximately once per second to 3 bridges. The bridges were connected to a building local area network which relayed data to a cloud-based service. Data were archived once per minute with the minimum, mean, and maximum power draw over each one minute interval recorded. The uncontrolled portion of the testing spanned approximately five weeks and established a baseline energy consumption. The controlled portion of the testing employed schedule-based rules for turning off selected loads during non-business hours; it also modified the energy saver policies for certain devices.

Three folders are provided: “matFilesAllChOneDate” provides a MAT-file for each date, each file has all channels; “matFilesOneChAllDates” provides a MAT-file for each channel, each file has all dates; “csvFiles” provides comma separated values files for each date (note that because of data export size limitations, there are 10 csv files for each date). Each folder has the same data; there is no practical difference in content, only the way in which it is organized.* [Privacy Preservation through Random Nonlinear Distortion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ugj6-i2sw) - Consider a scenario in which the data owner has some private or sensitive data and wants a data miner to access them for studying important patterns without revealing the sensitive information. Privacy-preserving data mining aims to solve this problem by randomly transforming the data prior to their release to the data miners. Previous works only considered the case of linear data perturbations - additive, multiplicative, or a combination of both - for studying the usefulness of the perturbed output. In this paper, we discuss nonlinear data distortion using potentially nonlinear random data transformation and show how it can be useful for privacy-preserving anomaly detection from sensitive data sets. We develop bounds on the expected accuracy of the nonlinear distortion and also quantify privacy by using standard definitions. The highlight of this approach is to allow a user to control the amount of privacy by varying the degree of nonlinearity. We show how our general transformation can be used for anomaly detection in practice for two specific problem instances: a linear model and a popular nonlinear model using the sigmoid function. We also analyze the proposed nonlinear transformation in full generality and then show that, for specific cases, it is distance preserving. A main contribution of this paper is the discussion between the invertibility of a transformation and privacy preservation and the application of these techniques to outlier detection. The experiments conducted on real-life data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.* [LBA-ECO LC-39 MODIS Active Fire and Frequency Data for South America: 2000-2007](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gumw-g2hg) - This data set provides active fire locations and estimates of annual fire frequencies for South America from 2000-2007. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2003-2007) satellite platforms were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal patterns in satellite fire detections. The analysis considered a high-confidence subset of all MODIS fire detections to reduce the influence of false fire detections over small forest clearings in Amazonia (Schroeder et al., 2008). The number of unique days on which the active fire detections were recorded within a 1 km radius was estimated from the subset of active fire detections and the ArcGIS neighborhood variety algorithm. There are 14 data files with this data set: 7 GeoTIFF (.tif) files of fire frequency at MODIS 250 m resolution, where each grid cell value represents the number of days in that year on which active fires were detected, and 7 shape files of active fire locations for the years 2001-2007.* [IRAS MINOR PLANET SURVEY ASTEROIDS V5.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s5mh-xmjd) - Derived diameters and albedoes of asteroids, plus associated data on sighting and non-sightings, extracted from the IRAS archives.* [SMEX03 AMSR-E Daily Gridded Soil Moisture and Brightness Temperatures, Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2hi7-36tu) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.

This data set contains Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) Level-3 daily measurements of surface soil moisture and vegetation/roughness water content interpretive information, as well as brightness temperatures and quality control variables.

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.

The experiment was conducted from March through July 2003 via the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument on board the European Space Agency's (ESA) Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT). Cross-polarized C-band ASAR images were acquired in order to obtain a backscatter coefficient measurement over a range of natural vegetation types. However, the images provided here are only browse images and therefore cannot be used to derive backscatter coefficient values. Researchers interested in backscatter coefficient values must obtain the ASAR data. The total volume for this combined data set is approximately 65 megabytes. Data are available via FTP and are provided as JPEG image files and JGW georeference files. Also included and available via FTP are the following types of header files: HAN files, ASCII text files, and INI files.

A single-axis gasless ACS experiment was successfully flown on a sounding rocket. The single-axis system is being expanded to three axes to provide gasless attitude control with greater accuracy than is presently achievable.</p><p>Sounding rocket payload attitude is currently controlled by a system of cold gas thrusters. The gas released by the thruster has the potential to interfere with science instruments that are sensing matter in the local environment. There is interest in the sounding rocket science community in an ACS that can provide fine attitude control without releasing gas. A three-axis reaction wheel assembly (RWA) can provide gasless fine attitude control during science operations. Large maneuvers and coarse control would still be provided by the standard cold gas thrusters, but the gas would be shut off and control would be handed over to the RWA during portions of the flight critical to sensitive science instruments. In addition to being gasless, a RWA ACS can also provide more precise attitude control than can be achieved through pulsed thrusting of a cold gas system.</p><p>A single-axis gasless ACS proof of concept experiment was flown March 1, 2016.</p><p>The scope of the project is to expand the single-axis system used for the proof of concept flight into a three-axis ACS. Existing software for the controller and software-in-the-loop (SWIL) simulation testing will need to be expanded to include pitch and yaw axes. Maneuver limits and wheel saturation rates with typical disturbances will be estimated to create a trade space of hardware requirements, and hardware that meets those requirements will be identified. Potential processors will be evaluated. Wheels will be sized for the pitch and yaw axes and re-evaluated for the roll axis. Capability for spinning attitude control will also be added. Performance estimates will be made for both the LN-200 and the more accurate LN-251 IRU.</p><p>The overall objective of the project is to mature the three-axis design to the point that it will represent a minimal schedule risk when included in either a Sounding Rocket Program Office (SRPO) development mission or a science mission willing to take a risk on a developmental system, and to develop an accurate cost estimate to aid in securing funding for a flight demonstration. Project deliverables will include controller software for both spinning and non-spinning payloads, a set of hardware requirements for the system, and performance and cost estimates for the system.</p>* [Compact High-Power Widely Tunable Mid-IR Light Source for Planetary Exploration, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hw28-g8cc) - Los Gatos Research, Inc. (LGR) and Professor Martin Fejer and his group at Stanford University propose to develop and demonstrate a compact, monolithic, efficient, high-power, narrow-linewidth tunable laser source operating in the 3.2-3.4 um wavelength region. LGR's mid-infrared (mid-IR) light source, based on a fiber-laser pumped monolithic optical parametric oscillator (OPO) developed at Stanford, will assist NASA in completing its trace-gas-detection objectives by supplying NASA with a critical, difficult-to-obtain laser source suitable for continuous-wave (cw) spectroscopy. During Phase I, LGR and Stanford will manufacture a monolithic OPO crystal, using techniques established by Stanford, generating between 1-2 W of single-frequency radiation between 3.2-3.4 um. At the end of Phase I, the OPO system will be used to measure transmission through a 50-cm-long methane cell (manufactured by LGR) at wavelengths corresponding to the C-H stretch vibrational resonance, 3.3 um. Technology readiness level (TRL) 4 will be reached at the completion of Phase I. During Phase II, remote detection of methane will be performed using a methane cell and measuring the backscattered light from the cell as the OPO mid-IR frequency is scanned ~5 GHz. The size of the housing for the monolithic OPO will be designed to reduce the overall size and weight of the mid-IR-laser head. Fiber-coupling for the incoming pump and the outgoing mid-IR radiation will be added to the OPO housing enabling simple fiber delivery. Modeling of the system sensitivity in ppm of methane will be performed for the final remote sensing system for ground-, air-, and space-based operation.* [Scotch-Tape Mirror for Hard X-rays Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/39pm-6xrw) - <p>The Scotch-Tape Mirror for Hard X-rays project is to test the possibility of building a grazing incidence mirror for hard X-rays (E&gt;20 keV) using a &ldquo;scotch-tape&rdquo; design, in which a thin plastic tape with a specific thickness profile and a multilayer reflective coating is tightly wound into a roll. The goal is to find a low-cost way of building a telescope for hard X-rays with a very large effective area.<br />&nbsp;</p> <p>The project is to build a grazing incidence mirror for hard X-rays (E&gt;20 keV) using a &ldquo;scotch-tape&rdquo; design, in which a thin plastic tape with a specific thickness profile and a multilayer reflective coating is tightly wound into a roll. Key challenges are (a) to find a suitably smooth tape substrate (this has been done), (b) to wind a large number of tape shells onto the smooth metal centerpiece without introducing and accumulating shape irregularities, and (c) to give the tape the variable thickness profile in order to achieve the desired optical figure. Our immediate goal is to demonstrate the idea feasibility by building a crude conical X-ray concentrator. If successful, we will aim at building and flying a mirror prototype on a balloon and then proposing for an Explorer mission or MOO. The ultimate goal is a telescope with 1 m^2 effective area at E=30 keV.<br />&nbsp;</p>* [Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.nasa.gov/d/x78a-qqtv) - Research at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) emphasizes a broad study of global change, which is an interdisciplinary initiative addressing natural and man-made changes in our environment that occur on various time scales from one-time forcings such as volcanic explosions, to seasonal and annual effects such as El Nino, and on up to the millennia of ice ages and that affect the habitability of our planet.* [Enabling closed-loop control of high degree-of-freedom soft robotic structures](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sbx8-cz6z) - To expand the nation’s capabilities for space exploration, a new approach to robotic manipulation is proposed. The approach utilizes soft materials to create an extremely dexterous manipulator which can accurately control its pose without use of an external sensor. This enables safe interaction between robotic systems, tools, and humans in cluttered spacecraft. Unlike more conventional robots made out of hard plastics and metals, the robot can be manufactured, expanded, and repaired onboard spacecraft. During launch, the majority of the robot’s materials can be stored as a liquid in jars. When the mission requires a robot, the standardized modules can simply be cast inside a standardized mold, combined with their circuitry, and assembled into the desired configuration. Training of the robot is done in a shape-agnostic fashion, allowing the approach to be applied to arbitrary manipulator configurations, in addition to broader classes of objects including robotic fabrics.* [High-Density Diffraction Imaging and Non-Imaging Grating Elements for EUV and X-ray Spectroscopy Fabricated by DUV Reduction Photolithography, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bgfe-6rv3) - There is a need for lightweight high-density (4000+ lines/mm) novel diffraction grating elements in modern telescopes to advance EUV and X-ray astrophysics.  Current grating technologies (ruling and holographic beam interference) do not provide optimal solution for all grating requirements.  In response to NASA request, we propose to apply state-of-the art DUV reduction photolithographic tools developed for modern semiconductor industry and LightSmyth's proven design expertise in the application of this technology to the development of grating devices with constant and varying line spacing (VLS).  The proposal will focus on four major areas:  
(i) Development and demonstration of constant and VLS reflective diffraction grating elements for EUV and X-ray spectroscopy at glazing angle of incidence with straight lines. 
(ii) Development and demonstration of VLS reflective diffraction grating elements for EUV and X-ray spectroscopy at glazing angle of incidence with curved lines to produce focusing diffraction grating elements on a plane substrate. 
(iii) Design of in-plane and off-plane reflective diffraction grating elements for NASA's Constellation-X.

Edition1-CV data are for instrument validation purposes only and not suited for science publications.Each Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data product contains twenty-four hours of Level-1b data for each CERES scanner instrument mounted on each spacecraft. The BDS includes samples taken in normal and short Earth scan elevation profiles in both fixed and rotating azimuth scan modes (including space, internal calibration, and solar calibration views). The BDS contains Level-0 raw (unconverted) science and instrument data as well as the geolocated converted science and instrument data. The BDS contains additional data not found in the Level-0 input file, including converted satellite position and velocity data, celestial data, converted digital status data, and parameters used in the radiance count conversion equations.      CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful  Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002. The newest CERES instrument (FM5) was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011.* [Fault Detection and Isolation of Satellite Formations using a Ground Station, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j3r3-hrcc) - This proposal is for the development a fault detection and isolation (FDI) algorithm for a formation of satellites but processed at a ground station.  The algorithm will be capable of operating when measurement data is available on an intermittent basis.  An FDI algorithm for faults in the three translational and rotational modes of 4 satellites flying in formation in a highly elliptical orbit will be designed during the Phase 1 effort.  The satellites will carry a limited suite of instruments, just sufficient to determine faults in the three translational and rotational modes and include a GPS receiver.  Communication with a ground station will only be available near perigee.  The measurement data is not stored and transmitted in bursts, so these communication blackouts represent a break in the time history of measurements.  The proposed development will mitigate these breaks so that fault detection and isolation can be performed faster than in a simple, cyclical restart implementation.  Furthermore, their elliptical orbit will carry the satellites beyond the GPS constellation.  The proposed development will account for the loss of GPS coverage as well investigate ways of extending the useful of GPS (when signals are weak) for fault detection and isolation.* [Multi-Fidelity Multi-Strategy and Multi-Disciplinary Design Optimization Environment, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sqyp-pvta) - Multidisciplinary design and optimization (MDO) tools developed to perform multi-disciplinary analysis based on low fidelity computation methods have been used in aircraft conceptual design for decades.  These tools have been proven very effective for simple problems and mostly have been developed as a single codes.  However, as analyses have become more complex and the need to consider more design factors crucial, such codes have grown so large as to be inconceivable and difficult to maintain.  Nowadays, the design optimization process of a modern airplane must account for all failure modes and behavior constraints.  In addition, it should cover manufacturing constraints and limitations on available resources, such as power, weight, and cost, simultaneously.  This has to be done in an integrated way, so that the effects of any change in the design on all constraints and behavior measures are accurately modeled, and all interactions and trade-offs among design variables and disciplines are allowed to affect the design.
ZONA Technology (ZONA) and its team member (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University), hereinafter referred to as "the ZONA team", propose in Phase I to develop a multi-fidelity, multi-strategy and multi-disciplinary design optimization environment, called the M3 Design Optimization Environment (M3 DOE) that consists of a three-layer optimization strategy, a multi-fidelity aerodynamic discipline, and a finite element analysis including outer mold line morphing and topology re-meshing capability.  The M3 DOE allows the designer to select an appropriate optimization strategy and an aerodynamic method with an appropriate fidelity to obtain an optimum design with desired accuracy within the allowable time constraint.* [Comparative Analysis of Data-Driven Anomaly Detection Methods](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ydqx-nujt) - This paper provides a review of three different advanced machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection in continuous data streams from a ground-test firing of a subscale Solid Rocket Motor (SRM). This study compares Orca, one-class support vector machines, and the Inductive Monitoring System (IMS) for anomaly detection on the data streams. We measure the performance of the algorithm with respect to the detection horizon for situations where fault information is available. These algorithms have been also studied by the present authors (and other co-authors) as applied to liquid propulsion systems. The trade space will be explored between these algorithms for both types of propulsion systems.* [SMEX03 Regional Ground Soil Moisture Data: Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f3ue-xv3k) - This data set comprises gravimetric soil moisture and soil bulk density data collected during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03), which was conducted during June and July of 2003 in northern Alabama and southern Tennessee, USA.* [Cold-Lightweight Imagers for Europa (C-LIFE)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qf9r-9wh8) - Europa and other Ocean Worlds may possess extant life; sending a lander has become a high priority. Several types of imaging are needed to advance the science and operations. Cold-Lightweight Imagers for Europa (C-LIFE), is an instrument suite containing a stereoscopic color imager (SI) and a uniocular microscopic polarizing imager (MI). The SI achieves resolutions of 1 mm/pixel from a range of 3m in 3 color filters, while the MI illuminates samples with filtered LEDs and characterizes ice grains and non-ice materials down to plate scales of 10 microns/pixel. C-LIFE objectives are to: (1) Search for evidence of biomarkers and/or life, particularly with the microscopic imager; (2) Characterize surface properties and local geologic context; and (3) Guide surface activities for sample collection.

Small cameras on landed missions represent a mature technology for missions to Mars, but not in the thermal and radiation environments of Europa and other Ocean Worlds, especially given severe mass and power limitations. For example, mass and power limitations drive us to use small pixel format CMOS detectors that lack adequate testing. We expect electronics inside the shielded lander will have a high TRL, but the external camera components require development to meet the challenging requirements such as very low mass and power, radiation tolerance, and planetary protection protocols.

The University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (UA LPL) plans to propose such an instrument concept for a Europa lander and other Ocean-World landers in the future. The UA team has extensive relevant experience, including Phoenix SSI and RAC, Cassini-Huygens DISR, Mars Pathfinder IMP and, most recently, OSIRIS-REx OCAMS.  In this COLDTech effort, we advance the qualification of several key elements of C-LIFE in readiness for flight opportunities to Ocean Worlds by: (1) Developing a detector testbed capable of down-selecting candidate CMOS devices, (2) Testing CMOS detectors, filters and micro-polarizing arrays in relevant environments, (3) Measuring the refractive indices of rad-hard lenses at ocean-world temperatures, (4) Fabricating and testing a Sample Transport Mechanism to deliver samples to the MI and (5) Constructing engineering models of the MI and SI and testing in relevant environments.

We expect the key subsystems to progress from TRL 3 or 4 to TRL 5 or 6 via this proposed effort. To achieve these goals we are partnering with the Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL), which provides some key capabilities and facilities to complement those at UA. Together with our SDL partners, we will thermal and radiation test a number of promising new commercial off-the-shelf CMOS detectors to identify the best candidate for C-LIFE. We will also collaborate with industrial partners such as e2v and ONSemi for detectors, 4D Technology for micropolarimeter arrays and PIXELTEQ for filters.  Prototypes of the successful SI and MI design will be fabricated and tested under relevant environments at UA to achieve TRL 5/6.

  Increasing the technical readiness of C-LIFE directly addresses COLDTech objectives to develop and advance the maturity of science instruments focused on understanding habitability and the detection of evidence of life in the ocean worlds of the outer Solar System. Recommendations of the upcoming Europa Lander Science Definition Team Report will be folded into our design to the extent possible when the report becomes available.* [Europan Molecular Indicators of Life Investigation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4kk9-yw3c) - The Europa Lander mission represents an enormous opportunity to capitalize on scientific discoveries at Europa by enhancing its planned exploration, toward a direct search for signs of life. The full understanding of Europa’s habitability will be established by the Europa Multiple Flyby Mission (EMFM). The EMFM payload, including highly capable imagers, spectrophotometers, mass spectrometers, and particle and wave sensors, will make critical observations of Europa’s subsurface ocean, its complex icy surface, and its surface-bounded exosphere to produce a clear picture of the extent and cycling of its water and chemical inventories. With this foundation, a follow-up lander will then be able to address hypotheses about key astrobiological markers in the icy surface. If deep plume activity is confirmed, the lander could potentially sample fresh, ocean-borne surface deposits for biosignature detection.
With these ambitious objectives, relative to the timeframe for lander payload selection, it is absolutely imperative to focus attention on instrument technologies that both (1) address expected complex molecular detection and characterization requirements with exquisite sensitivity and specificity, and (2) are on a realistic technical path to compatibility with the extreme payload resource and environmental constraints of a Europa surface mission. We propose to mature a Europa-specific implementation of the Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (LITMS) investigation to meet these dual requirements in the search for signs of extant life.
LITMS is a dual-ion source precision molecular analyzer derived from the substantial heritage of the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) investigation under development in our lab for the ExoMars rover. LITMS brings the power of both gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) of solid samples to fine spatial scales (sub-mm) with its precision analyses. As on Mars, detection of complex organics at fine scales offers significant advantages in examining features key to distinguishing biogenic and abiogenic molecules, compared to bulk analysis. LITMS further provides enhanced capabilities, compared to MOMA, including detection of both positive and negative ions, a wider range of molecular weights (to over 2 kDa), and direct evolved gas analysis – all of which substantially increase the sensitivity of LITMS to the widest possible range of molecular organic biosignatures within their geochemical context. LITMS has been developed for the past three years with support of the MatISSE program, and will achieve TRL 6 for Mars surface operations at the end of this year.
To re-achieve TRL 6 for a Europa lander mission focused on extant life, we will focus our COLDTech effort in three critical areas: (1) Refinement and validation of the precision sampling GCMS + LDMS operational modes for characterization of trace complex molecular biosignatures in cryogenic Europan samples; (2) Analysis, testing, and optimization of the appropriate LITMS hardware and operational mitigation approaches for the intense penetrating radiation at Europa; and (3) Design and development of a flight-like LITMS brassboard for Europa that (3a) rigorously meets PDR-level TRL 6 criteria, and (3b) enables a flight design demonstrably compliant with the most stringent planetary protection and contamination control requirements of the mission.
Lacking a requirement to redesign the core LITMS analyzer, which has already been developed at flight scale and meets extremely challenging measurement requirements for Mars missions, our proposed COLDTech development is able to devote significant and necessary attention to the Europa-specific features to minimize technical and cost risk of an eventual flight model. With COLDTech support we anticipate that LITMS could be among the few investigations that would be fully ready for the challenge of contributing to direct detection of life on Europa.* [Rapid Electrochemical Detection and Identification of Microbiological and Chemical Contaminants for Manned Spaceflight Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/etez-iz7e) - &lt;p&gt;A great deal of effort has gone into the development of point-of-use methods to meet the challenge of rapid bacterial identification for both environmental monitoring and clinical applications.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, most of the methods developed rely on Preliminary Chain Reaction (PCR) and face inherent limitations because of the requirement for enzymatic components and thermal control.&amp;nbsp; Other methods based on surface plasmon resonance, quartz crystal microbalance, and fluorescence has been reported with good detection limits, but, these methods are immunological and cannot provide genetic-level information.&amp;nbsp; Further, they require labeled markers, complicated fluid handling systems, and sensitive optics that drive up cost and complexity and preclude them from outside the laboratory.&amp;nbsp; Recent work by a group at the University of Toronto has focused on developing an electrochemical platform that combines ultrasensitive detection, straightforward sample processing, and inexpensive components to create a cost-effective, user-friendly device for detection and identification of microorganisms.&amp;nbsp; The platform combines an electrical cell lysis chamber, and electrochemical reporter system, and nanostructured microelectrodes (NMEs) to detect specific nucleic acid sequences.&amp;nbsp; The nucleic acid sequences are unique to a given type of microorganism and can be used to identify the microorganisms present in a sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of the anticipated prototype device &amp;nbsp;(Lam, et al. 2012. &lt;em&gt;Polymerase Chain Reaction-Free, Sample-to-Answer Bacterial Detection in 30 Minutes with Integrated Cell Lysis&lt;/em&gt;. Anal.

The overall project will focus on optimization of the individual aspects of the detection platform in preparation for construction of a prototype for a flight experiment.&amp;nbsp; The scope of the work in this proposal is limited to characterization and optimization of the lysis step/sample preparation, probe selection, and NME structure.&amp;nbsp; Lysis conditions will be optimized by evaluating parameters associated with the oscillation frequency and lysis time for ultrasonic techniques and applied voltage for the electrochemical techniques.&amp;nbsp; Cell viability, as determined by fluorescent detection of DNA or R* [Precise Automatic Image Coregistration Tools to Enable Pixel-Level Change Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nab4-t3ug) - Automated detection of land cover changes between multitemporal images (i.e., images captured at different times) has long been a goal of the remote sensing discipline.  Most technology in this area has focused on methods for detecting and identifying land cover or surface object changes in two or more images, but precise co-registration of images remains a key challenge. In fact, image-to-image registration and image-based change detection are intricately related, as the success of conducting both relies on the precision of the other; software that supports these functions should do so in an integrative manner. Image registration is the key factor influencing the success of detecting land cover changes at or near pixel scale.  We will develop tools in the form of a "software development kit" (SDK) specifically optimized for precise co-registration of two or more images with minimal user interaction, with the primary motivation to enable change detection algorithms to focus on salient changes rather than highlight image registration errors.  The SDK will be available to NASA at no cost, after which we will build user applications based on the SDK for commercial offering.* [SMEX03 Vegetation Data: Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nzqf-4hyv) - This data set includes data collected over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) area of northern Alabama, USA between 22 June and 1 July 2003. The parameters measured were plant height, plant stand density, phenology, wet biomass, dry biomass, row spacing, and row direction. Data were collected at crop, pasture, and forested sites. Those sites are part of the Alabama MesoNet (ALMNet), which is run by Alabama A&M University's Center for Hydrology, Soil Climatology and Remote Sensing (HSCaRS). Data are provided in an ASCII text file and a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and are available via FTP.

These data were collected as part of a validation study for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). AMSR-E is a mission instrument launched aboard NASA's Aqua Satellite on 04 May 2002. AMSR-E validation studies linked to SMEX are designed to evaluate the accuracy of AMSR-E soil moisture data. Specific validation objectives include assessing and refining soil moisture algorithm performance; verifying soil moisture estimation accuracy; investigating the effects of vegetation, surface temperature, topography, and soil texture on soil moisture accuracy; and determining the regions that are useful for AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Ultra-Rapid Earth Rotation Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tjrv-s8r2) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Ultra-Rapid Earth Rotation Product (ERP) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure.  Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce GNSS Earth Rotation products. The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS ultra-rapid combined ERP products. The ultra-rapid ERP combination is a sub-daily solution, released four times per day, at 03:00, 09:00, 15:00, and 21:00 UTC (prior to GPS week 1267 they were released twice daily). IGS ultra-rapid ERP files are to be used with the IGS ultra-rapid orbit solution files. All ERP solution files utilize the IGS ERP format.* [Tissue-Equivalent Radiation Dosimeter-On-A-Chip, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/saym-9rpx) - Available digital dosimeters are bulky and unable to provide real-time monitoring of dose for space radiation.  The complexity of space-flight design requires reliable, fault-tolerant equipment capable of providing real-time dose readings during a mission, which is not feasible with the existing thermo-luminescent dosimeter (TLD) technology, especially during extravehicular activities (EVA).  Real-time monitoring is important for low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and interplanetary space flight to alert the crew when Solar Particle Events (SPE) increase the particle flux of the spacecraft environment.  
The Phase-II project will design and fabricate a prototype Dosimeter-on-a-Chip (DoseChip) for personal dosimetry comprised of a tissue-equivalent scintillation crystal coupled to a solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM).  The ubiquitous nature of CMOS technology provides a standardized development platform, and the ability to integrate the supporting electronics into a miniature, lightweight design.
The DoseChip provides a tissue-equivalent response to the relevant energies and types of radiation for low-Earth orbit and interplanetary space flight to the moon or Mars and will be sensitive to the dose rates and particle fluxes of ambient Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) to the higher rates of major SPE.  The DoseChip will complement the existing Crew Passive Dosimeters by providing real-time dosimetry and as an alarming monitor for SPE.* [SMEX03 Two-Dimensional Synthetic Aperture Radiometer (2D-STAR) Brightness Temperatures, Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/h7hp-r5ie) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.

This data set includes dual-polarized L-band brightness temperatures measured by the Two-Dimensional Synthetic Aperture Radiometer (2D-STAR) instrument. An aircraft carrying the instrument was flown over Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma USA as part of the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03).* [Poverty Mapping Project: Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gte3-q924) - The Global Subnational Prevalence of Child Malnutrition dataset consists of estimates of the 

percentage of children with weight-for-age z-scores that are more than two standard deviations below the median of the NCHS/CDC/WHO

These AVHRR data contain two main sets of data: site extracts of SAFARI core sites (Mongu, Etosha, Kasungu, Maun, Skukuza, and Tshane), and regional 15-day composites from sets of single-day images. These AVHRR data contain four main sets of data:1.5 km daily site extracts of SAFARI core sites (2000)1.5 km 15-day composites of SAFARI core sites (1998-2000)1.5 km 15-day composites of the southern African region (Mar, Sept 2000)6 km 15-day composites of the southern African region (1998-2000)The primary data layers for site extracts and regional composites are fire pixel counts and maximum NDVI. The fire product is different for the daily and for the composited products (see readme file) and a fire product is not included in the 1.5 km regional data set.  NDVI composite-associated data layers for the regional data sets include land surface temperature, reflectance, solar zenith angle, view zenith angle, and relative azimuth angle. NDVI composite-associated data layers for the site extracts include these same variables as well as brightness temperature, fire mask composite, latitude, and longitude. The data are stored in binary image format files. There is a metadata file for each site and date/compositing period, in ASCII format.* [High Efficiency Hybrid Energy Storage Utilizing High Power Density Ultracapacitors For Long Duration Balloon Flights, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gieh-iq9z) - FastCAP proposes to develop an ultra-high power density and high frequency ultracapacitor capable of surviving over the wide temperature range of -60C to 130C and exhibiting peak gravimetric and volumetric power density of 120kW/kg and 150kW/L respectively. FastCAP is planning to design and prototype a hybrid system comprised of the proposed ultracapacitor in parallel with a high energy density, rechargeable, lithium ion battery showing at least 50% volume reduction and 100% lifetime increase compared to stand-alone lithium batteries, meeting long duration research balloon requirements. During Phase I, FastCAP will evaluate both novel under-development and off-the-shelf lithium chemistries utilized in aerospace applications. The resulting hybrid battery-ultracapacitor (HBU) system combines the benefits of both technologies and will meet NASA's scientific balloon requirements of energy density, power density, shelf life, temperature, reliability and cycle life. This ultracapacitor can also be coupled to a piezoelectric generator, thanks to a high cut off frequency greater than 500Hz. The proposed HBU system will enable significant improvements in the design of power storage for terrestrial and planetary balloons, reducing their weight, volume, and complexity, while improving performance and relaxing design constraints on scarce candidate battery technologies. Compared to today's high-rate reserve and rechargeable battery technologies, the proposed hybrid system will provide much higher power and higher energy density, show tremendous improvement in cycle lifetime, and show reduced risk of explosion and thermal runaway associated with high-rate discharge, thanks to the power buffering role of the ultracapacitor within the HBU system. In applications where batteries are currently oversized for power handling, dramatic reductions in total energy storage system weight will be achieved by complementing those batteries with ultracapacitors.* [MOPITT Gridded Daily CO Retrievals (Thermal Infrared Radiances) V006](https://data.nasa.gov/d/emms-45mp) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals. The averaging kernels associated with each retrieval are also gridded and included in the L3 files. For a description of the file contents, refer to the File Spec Document. Please see the MOPITT L2 Data Quality Statement for additional information about the quality and the limitations of the retrievals. [From the MOPITT V3 Level 3 Data Quality Summary]Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) was successfully launched into sun-synchronous polar orbit aboard Terra, NASA's first Earth Observing System spacecraft on December 18, 1999. The MOPITT instrument was constructed by a consortium of Canadian companies and funded by the Space Science Division of the Canadian Space Agency.* [Versatile Attitude Control Actuators for Sub-Milliarcsecond Precision Pointing, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/iein-vmfn) - Growing scientific and practical needs exist for precision spacecraft pointing at milliarcsec (mas) levels. Present state-of-the-art reaction wheels, or similar, actuators introduce vibrational jitter and can ultimately drive pointing error. Busek electrospray thrusters aboard the ESA LISA Pathfinder mission have recently demonstrated nm scale position control. The proposed system will provide vibration-free sub-mas pointing control through integration of follow-on innovations and new deployable boom technologies. Recent thruster innovations have dramatically increased maximum thrust, while retaining control resolution, and reduced propellant loads through increased specific impulse. These gains will be applied in this work to replace reaction wheel actuators for both precision control and slew maneuvers. Accordingly, actuator induced vibrations are virtually eliminated while body pointing will be dramatically improved; resulting in major reductions in ACS SWaP and in the complexity of vibration compensating controllers/active sensors. With applications to, for example, observation and laser communication missions these benefits would both enable high-capability but reduced cost spacecraft and pave the way for new, presently, unobtainable levels of control authority on large spacecraft. Phase I will emphasize acquisition and analysis of precision thrust control measurements using the BET-1mN thruster-head which, uniquely, can be operated in either a high thrust, low Isp, or low thrust, high Isp configuration. The associated complex performance map will be analyzed in the context of highly quiescent ACS needs. These data will then be applied to define necessary control, circuitry and mechanical requirements needed to realize the full-attitude control potential of the technology. A conceptual system level design performed in collaboration with ROCCOR will outline strategies to overcome required developments and produce a complete system demonstration in Phase II.* [SMEX03 Surface and Soil Temperature Measurements: Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ungv-b9yv) - This data set contains land surface temperature and soil temperature data collected during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) in northern Alabama and southern Tennessee* [System for Acquisition and Analysis of Energy-Based Acoustic Data for Rocket Noise, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hjsy-izeb) - Accurate estimates of the vibroacoustic loading placed on space vehicles and payloads during launch require knowledge of the rocket noise source properties.  Given the extreme nature of acoustic environments near the plume, data sufficient to characterize the noise source region have been difficult to acquire.  Without these data, structures may be designed to handle an insufficient or excessive vibroacoustic loads, resulting in either an overbuilt structure (and extra weight), or an under-designed vibration isolation system that could result in damaged cargos.
Current energy base acoustic probe designs have limited frequency bandwidth due to physical limitations.  A new set of probe designs is proposed that incorporate both a new physical probe design but also a more advanced signal processing methodology that will significantly increase the usable frequency bandwidth of the probes while reducing the manufacturing and maintenance costs of the probes.
The probe system will also include the design of a complete data acquisition system capable of recording data under the harsh conditions present in typical rocket motor test firings.* [Ares I-X Ground Diagnostic Prototype](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gj6b-2xem) - The automation of pre-launch diagnostics for launch vehicles offers three potential benefits: improving safety, reducing cost, and reducing launch delays. The Ares I-X Ground Diagnostic Prototype demonstrated anomaly detection, fault detection, fault isolation, and diagnostics for the Ares I-X first-stage Thrust Vector Control and for the associated ground hydraulics while the vehicle was in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and while it was on the launch pad. The prototype combines three existing tools. The first tool, TEAMS (Testability Engineering and Maintenance System), is a model-based tool from Qualtech Systems Inc. for fault isolation and diagnostics. The second tool, SHINE (Spacecraft Health Inference Engine), is a rule-based expert system that was developed at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We developed SHINE rules for fault detection and mode identification, and used the outputs of SHINE as inputs to TEAMS. The third tool, IMS (Inductive Monitoring System), is an anomaly detection tool that was developed at NASA Ames Research Center. The three tools were integrated and deployed to KSC, where they were interfaced with live data. This paper describes how the prototype performed during the period before the launch, including accuracy and computer resource usage. The paper concludes with some of the lessons that we learned from the experience of developing and deploying the prototype.* [Comparison of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Methods](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gp8b-j5x2) - Several different unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been applied to Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) data to serve the purpose of developing a comprehensive suite of Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) tools. As the theoretical bases for these methods vary considerably, it is reasonable to conjecture that the resulting anomalies detected by them may differ quite significantly as well. As such, it would be useful to apply a common metric with which to compare the results. However, for such a quantitative analysis to be statistically significant, a sufficient number of examples of both nominally categorized and anomalous data must be available. Due to the lack of sufficient examples of anomalous data, use of any statistics that rely upon a statistically significant sample of anomalous data is infeasible. Therefore, the main focus of this paper will be to compare actual examples of anomalies detected by the algorithms via the sensors in which they appear, as well the times at which they appear. We find that there is enough overlap in detection of the anomalies among all of the different algorithms tested in order for them to corroborate the severity of these anomalies. In certain cases, the severity of these anomalies is supported by their categorization as failures by experts, with realistic physical explanations. For those anomalies that can not be corroborated by at least one other method, this overlap says less about the severity of the anomaly, and more about their technical nuances, which will also be discussed.* [Highly Adaptive Primary Mirror Having Embedded Actuators, Sensors, and Neural Control, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cziz-kepq) - Xinetics has demonstrated the technology required to fabricate a self-compensating highly adaptive silicon carbide primary mirror system having embedded actuators, sensors, and neural control with an areal density less that 10Kg/m2. The system architecture complete with feedback sensors, and neural algorithm was conceived, modeled and tested, and appears scaleable to 10-30meter class deployable systems. Highly adaptive telescopes require self-compensating telescope components to enable autonomously optimized optical trains to achieve very low total system wavefront error. High sensitivity semiconductor strain gages were shown to have adequate resolution for shape control. Resistance RTD sensors were shown to provide more than adequate temperature sensitivity. Analysis of strain gage placement conducted during this Phase I showed that the strain sensors required for neural control will require very high precision strain measurement (less than 1 microstrain), potential sensors were tested and characterized. Phase I data acquisition system limitations prevented full closed loop hardware demonstration. As a result Xinetics demonstrated the closed loop function using FEA analysis to provide simulated data to train the MATLAB based neural control algorithm. Phase I results show very encouraging performance and provide design information for a solid technical plan for full hardware demonstration in a phase II.* [Efficient Quantification of Uncertainties in Complex Computer Code Results, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3ae6-qwkf) - Propagation of parameter uncertainties through large computer models can be very resource intensive. Frameworks and tools for uncertainty quantification are generally geared to individual codes, are research codes, or are single-purpose tools such as LHS matrix generators. The Reduced-Order-Clustering-Uncertainty-Quantification (ROCUQ) methodology discussed in this proposal is specifically designed to circumvent many of the issues associated with uncertainty quantification of large simulation codes. The ROCUQ methodology has been applied in several different physical disciplines with good results. The computational methodology is a combination of reduced-order modeling, stratified sampling (Latin Hypercube Sampling -- LHS), statistical clustering of results (K-means clustering) and a few (five to ten) full-physics runs of the high-fidelity model under investigation. The method should be applicable to hundreds of uncertain variables when required. ROCUQ enables estimates of system response quantities (SRQ) uncertainty distributions for situations where it is not feasible to use purely sampling, collocation, or other techniques where many runs would be required. For some organizations, uncertainty analysis has never been possible due to resource limitations, and thus is not part of the organizational culture. Many analysts know that uncertainties can be important, but have no way to expend sufficient resources (money, CPU cycles, time) to do the work needed to quantify uncertainties. A methodology such as ROCUQ promises to open doors in organizations that know that they have the need, and may now be able to actually perform the analyses. Successful completion of the Phase II project will produce not only new software that will be able to be used by researchers and industry, but will assemble insights on the use of reduced order models in a variety of disciplines, and provide guidance and rules for the use of ROCUQ for the estimation of SRQ uncertainty distributions.* [Advanced Physical Models and Numerical Algorithms to Enable High-Fidelity Aerothermodynamic Simulations of Planetary Entry Vehicles on Emerging Distributed Heterogeneous Computing Architectures](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9jg2-fj2y) - The design and qualification of entry systems for planetary exploration largely rely on computational simulations. However, state-of-the-art modeling capabilities introduce substantial limitations in providing accurate and reliable predictions for aerothermodynamic flow environments of such entry, decent, and landing vehicles. These challenges are attributed to (i) the complexity of coupled multiphysical processes; (ii) limited experimental data for model validation; and (iii) the absence of advanced numerical algorithms and physical models for the accurate and efficient simulation of aerothermodynamic flows. By addressing these issues, the overall objective of this research is the development of advanced high-order numerical methods and high-fidelity physical models for the reliable prediction of aerothermodynamic flows that are relevant to hypersonic and atmospheric entry vehicles. Novel programming paradigms will be used for accelerating multiphysics simulation codes on emerging heterogeneous computing architectures. Combined, these modeling capabilities will provide improved predictions of heat-transfer, particle-laden reacting flows, and hypersonic environments to support the development of next-generation entry, descent, and landing systems.* [Chromatid Painting for Chromosomal Inversion Detection, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ubcw-du7d) - We propose a novel approach to the detection of chromosomal inversions.  Transmissible chromosome aberrations (translocations and inversions) have profound genetic effects, such as disrupting regulatory sequences that control gene expression, or creating genetic chimeras.  These chromosome aberrations play a causative role in cancer, and they are induced by radiation.  As such, chromosome aberrations are relevant to three NASA needs, biodosimetry, analysis of astronaut lymphocytes for cumulative radiation damage, and space radiation risk modeling.  Of all structural chromosomal anomalies, inversions -- a reversal of orientation of material within a chromosome -- are the most difficult to detect.  This is especially true of small inversions, most of which are invisible to all current cytogenetic techniques.  Yet small inversions are likely the most transmissible (nonlethal) form of chromosomal damage, so they persist, a feature which lends credence to their use in retrospective biodosimetry.  This Phase 1 project is intended to provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of a new method of molecular cytogenetics that will permit highly sensitive inversion detection.  The project will help us to perfect our bioinformatics strategy for probe design, optimize probe labeling reactions, refine hybridization conditions, and establish a procedure for cost analysis.  In Phase 2, we will scale-up probe production to make whole chromosome analysis possible.  This next step, although conceptually simple, relies entirely on the processes devised and tested in Phase 1.  Moreover efficient, cost-effective probe-making will be essential to commercialization (Phase 3).  The technology readiness level at the end of the Phase 1 contract is expected to be 4-5, i.e. validated in laboratory and relevant environments.* [Multifunctional Shielding and Self-Healing HybridSil Smart Composites for Space, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/grz3-i34g) - NanoSonic has recently developed multifunctional shielding and self-healing HybridSil&#63720; (HS) smart composites via the inclusion of innovative nanoshell inclusions.  These lightweight yet high-strength rapidly self-healing materials combined with NanoSonic's Metal Rubber&#153; (MR) shielding nano-additives and are offered herein as protection systems for NASA vehicles, habitat modules, and pressure vessel structures.  The conductive aspect of Metal Rubber also enables damage detection.  This technology may overcome the current bottleneck of damage tolerance for current composites that form nearly undetectable cracks upon impact that impart drastic effects on the structural survivability.  HS-MR self-healing composites offer both self-healing and damage detection, as well as the added functionality of very high levels of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) without the need for additional heavy layers.

During Phase I, TRL 5 shall be reached upon demonstration of damage tolerant, self-healing structural composites with assistance from our radiation expert STTR partner, CSU, and commercial space partner.  During Phase II, TRL 7 shall be achieved upon demonstrated damage detection and self-healing in a representative flight environment with our defense prime partner.* [Nanotechnology for Advanced Imaging and Detectors](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9eqy-f9dz) - <p>The goal of this IRAD is to apply nanotechnology to create new devices to enhance both the imaging and detection of light.  We have demonstrated the capability to fabricate nanostructured metallic devices to create "artificial molecules" which allow interaction with electromagnetic waves in novel ways.  Our goal is to design and build a protoype metamaterial device and characterize its properties for use in imaging and detector applications.<p/><p>Our first objective is that of nanostructured devices for advanced light detection.  Our periodic structures exhibit absorptive (nano-antenna) and reflective (magnetic mirror) resonances across the visible to near infrared wavelength range.  Fabrication of these "nano-antennae" can be utilized for enhanced detection and imaging of light and the toolbox of design and fabrication tools we have developed will be applied to making proof of concept devices.  Our goal will be to build a superconducting single photon counting detector.  While superconducting nano wire single photon counting detectors have been built before, ours will be designed to do integral spectroscopy In our second objective; metamaterials for advanced imaging, we are in the process of completing an impedance matched and nanowire edged absorber devices for diffraction suppression.  We will refine our designs based on observed performance of these types of devices with the goal of performing suppressing higher orders of the Airy pattern by apodizing the edge of our test optic.  To reiterate, essentially the same periodic metallic nanowire pattern as designed and fabricated for our detector use can selectively absorb light at the edge of our device to prevent the high order "ringing" observed in the Airy pattern.</p>* [Scotch-Tape Mirror for Hard X-rays](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jukb-nat5) - <p>The Scotch-Tape Mirror for Hard X-rays project is to test the possibility of building a grazing incidence mirror for hard X-rays (E>20 keV) using a "scotch-tape" design, in which a thin plastic tape with a specific thickness profile and a multilayer reflective coating is tightly wound into a roll. The goal is to find a low-cost way of building a telescope for hard X-rays with a very large effective area.<p/><p>The project is to build a grazing incidence mirror for hard X-rays (E>20 keV) using a "scotch-tape" design, in which a thin plastic tape with a specific thickness profile and a multilayer reflective coating is tightly wound into a roll. Key challenges are (a) to find a suitably smooth tape subatrate (this has been done), (b) to wind a large number of tape shells onto the smooth metal centerpiece without introducing and accummulating shape irregularities, and (c) to give the tape the variable thickness profile in order to achieve the desired optical figure. Our immediate goal is to demonstrate the idea feasibility by building a crude conical X-ray concentrator. If successful, we will aim at building and flying a mirror prototype on a balloon and then proposing for an Explorer mission or MOO.

Beyond sensing and controls challenges, there has been little work done exploring the application of transformative reconfigurations that deviate from traditional wheeled-rover design. Investigation of real-time repeatable, reversible changes in physical configuration will yield solutions capable of significant changes to system form. Outcomes from this work will include identifying technologies that facilitate reconfigurability, assessing their strengths and limitations, and developing proof-of-concept prototypes. (This is a project within the NASA Innovative Advanced, NIAC, program.)</p>* [The Enceladus Organic Analyzer](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wdya-7y6v) - Quantitative compositional and chiral organic molecule analysis is key to understanding an extraterrestrial location including its history, habitability and potential for past or present life. Few high-TRL instruments exist that can achieve this important goal. The advancement of the Enceladus Organic Analyzer (EOA) to TRL 6 will enable a powerful new approach for characterizing carbon chemistry in our solar system including the non-statistical distribution of organic molecules and optical isomers that tell us about the presence of extant or extinct life.
EOA is an innovative microchip capillary electrophoresis (μCE) system with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. The µCE electrophoretically separates molecules with high resolution, and is very effective for analysis of organics having a wide range of sizes and complexity from a variety of solid, ice or liquid sources. The integrated Programmable Microfluidic Analyzer (PMA) enables reliable, flexible fluidic processing. LIF is highly sensitive with picomolar concentration limits of detection (the equivalent of only attomoles detected).
EOA SCIENCE OBJECTIVES
Detect and quantify amines, amino acids, carboxylic acids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with parts-per-million sensitivity from samples as small as a few micrograms.
Separate multiple (>20) amine-containing species (including amino acids) that differ in isomer or carbon chain-length with baseline resolution. Perform similar analyses on carboxylic acids and polycyclic aromatics.
Separate chiral enantiomers of any observed amino acids.
EOA MISSIONS
Enceladus Plume Fly-By/Orbiter. The organic composition of the Enceladus plume is a high-priority science objective in the NASA Science Plan and the Decadal Survey prioritized an Enceladus orbiter.
Comets. The EOA could be used to sample and analyze organics from comets and their coma that are beyond sample return to answer questions about primordial sources of organic matter and current synthesis.
Icy Moon organic analysis. The core EOA analyzer instrument could also be deployed in orbiters, fly-by or lander missions that acquire solid/ice samples.
TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
Raise TRL of the PMA. This technology is at a high TRL (5) having been extensively tested in lab and challenging field applications. Our objective is to fully demonstrate the PMA in a relevant environment as an integrated prototype raising TRL to 6.
Raise TRL of LIF. LIF laser and optical detection systems have over a decade of development for space flight beginning with the Urey instrument for the ExoMars rover to the MOA instrument proposed for Mars 2020. This subsystem will be built and tested to elevate its TRL from 5 to 6.
Raise TRL of the Capture Plate System from 3 to 6. When samples for the EOA are acquired from plumes or ejecta, a capture plate collects material during a fly by. An efficient soft impact capture has been developed that obviates the confounding problem of organic contamination found with other soft impact strategies like aerogels.
Raise TRL of the integrated system including all peripheral hardware and control electronics. The TRL of most EOA components and subsystems is as high as 5. We will build and test an integrated technology demonstration unit with flight-like component subsystems raising the TRL of the whole instrument to 6.
RELEVANCE
The proposed work seeks to “develop and demonstrate” the EOA as a “planetary and astrobiology science instrument to the point where it may be proposed in response to future announcements of opportunity without additional extensive technology development (TRL 6).”
The EOA is an “innovative technology that improves instrument measurement capabilities” in a “small, low mass, low power” package, and is poised to “address significant scientific questions relevant to stated NASA goals.”
DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN is not required because this proposal is for instrument development only.* [Transport, Chemistry, and Energetics of Water in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere and Implications for Polar Mesospheric Cloud Occurrence](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7c89-a6q2) - <p>The overall goal of this proposal is to study the time-dependent neutral chemistry and transport of water in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) and to determine the resultant impact on the local temperature and ice cloud formation. To reach this goal, we will answer three science questions: 1. What is the energetic and chemical response of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere to water deposited in the lower thermosphere? 2. How does the injection of large amounts of water vapor change the thermodynamics and impact the physics of PMC formation? 3. How is the water vapor that gets injected into the lower thermosphere, redistributed vertically to the PMC region near 82 km? To answer these questions we propose to release a plume of water vapor at high latitudes from a rocket payload and observe how the atmosphere responds both during and after the release. We will observe the evolution of the plume of water with lidar measurements from Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR). The lidar is capable of tracking both the optical emissions from the region and measuring the temperature profiles. In addition, an Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM) instrument will be deployed at PFRR to observe the upper mesosphere (~87 km) before and during the water release to provide quantitative information on any dynamics/wave activity and changes in mesospheric temperature. The combination of the lidar and mapping imager thus provides strong ground-based diagnostics for the launch. The launch will be at twilight so that any formation of PMCs from the plume will be visible from the ground. Trimethyl aluminum (TMA) trails will be released in addition to the water from a separate payload canister. The TMA is chemi-luminescent and can be tracked optically from the ground with cameras and the naked eye. The movement of the TMA trails will thus provide a direct indication of how the water is moving since both will be transported by the background winds. The TMA measurements will be helpful both for real-time waater cloud tracking and for post-flight analysis. Our ground-based observations will be supported by observations from the NASA TIMED and AIM missions and modeling result from the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics General Circulation Model (TIMEGCM). We will interpret the observations of PMCs and temperature variations from the TIMED satellite that are driven by the plume chemistry with our TIMEGCM model. The TIMEGCM will be augmented to include all heating and cooling contributions from the plume water vapor, any resultant ice formation as well as vertical transport and heating of the ambient atmosphere by the ice. Model results will be compared with observed PMC data from AIM and corresponding TIMED/SABER temperatures to elucidate and understand the relationship between PMCs and bulk thermodynamics. Perceived significance: The proposed project deals with a science investigation that can be carried out with instruments flown on suborbital sounding rockets. It contributes to the science goal of &ldquo;understanding the fundamental physical processes of the space environment&rdquo; (2010 Science Plan for NASA SMD). The proposal is also relevant to the NASA Heliophysics Roadmap, including two out of three overarching objectives: (Open the Frontiers to Space Environment Prediction, and Understand the Nature of our Home in Space) and their associated Research Focus Areas. It also complements work performed under the NASA AIM and TIMED missions.</p>* ["Compact Color Biofinder" for fast, non-contact detection of bio-markers, biomolecules and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in Ocean Worlds](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fnma-pgh3) - We have developed a prototype instrument called “Standoff Biofinder” which is able to detect biomolecules and bio-markers from a collection of rocks and minerals in a large area with detection time of 0.1 s. The Standoff Biofinder takes advantage of the short lifetime of bio-fluorescent materials to obtain real-time images showing the locations of biological materials among luminescent minerals in a geological context. The instrument works in daylight as well as nighttime conditions and bio-detection capability is not affected by the background light. The Standoff Biofinder instrument will be suitable for locating fluorescent polyaromatic hydrocarbons, amino acids, proteins, bacteria, biominerals, photosynthetic pigments, and diagenetic products of microbial life both on dry landscapes as well as on Ocean Worlds of the outer Solar System (e.g., Enceladus, Europa, and Titan).
	At present, the images provided by the prototype biofinder are black and white images displaying the morphology and concentrations of biological molecules. In this proposal, we propose to develop the next generation of the instrument, “Compact Color Biofinder” (CoCoBi) which will provide color fluorescent images of biological species in a target area.  One of the advantages of the color biofinder over the present biofinder system would be ability to differentiate multiple biological materials in a target area which may contain a mixture of biological species in various concentrations. CoCoBi will be helpful in identifying the biological materials based on their fluorophore colors, along with morphologies and concentrations.  In addition, the color-biofinder will be significantly miniaturized in size and will be an ideal “search for life” future mission instrument. CoCoBi will be designed to look for ppm levels of biomaterial from a standoff distance of several centimeters in a geological setting, as well as in water and ice, with detection time less than 1 s. An important feature of the Standoff Biofinder instrument is its capability to detect biomolecules which are deeper in water and ice, without sample collection. The CoCoBi instrument will be useful for locating a biological material during future NASA rover, lander, and crewed missions to Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, Enceladus, Europa, Titan, asteroids etc. Additionally, the instrument can be used for non-contact, non-destructive detection of biological materials in priceless samples obtained from sample return missions from other planets and asteroids.
	Under this project, the TRL of the proposed compact color biofinder instrument will advance from TRL 2 to TRL 4.* [Development of Nanopore Sequencing for Automated Ocean World Life Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/x39w-j4qz) - In this COLDTech project, a solid-state nanopore instrument will be developed for the detection and study of biomarkers for microbial life in ocean world environments. The Sequencing of Life on Ocean Worlds (SeqLOW) instrument is a solid-state nanopore platform designed for the detection and characterization of polyanionic and polycationic polymers. SeqLOW heritage is derived from Oxford Nanopore’s MinION instrument, a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product. The MinION is a small, portable DNA sequencing platform that consists of protein nanopores embedded in an electrically resistant polymer material. The MinION is third generation sequencing technology and is robust enough for in situ field analysis here on Earth. The system is slated to be tested on the International Space Station in the summer of 2016. However, the integrity of the current protein nanopore membrane used in the MinION is not sufficiently robust to survive long duration space missions. The SeqLOW solid-state nanopore platform will advance current state-of-the-art nanopore sensing technology as a life detection instrument for use in future NASA missions.
SeqLOW COLDTech development goals are:
1) Development and fabrication of robust solid-state nanopore membranes with arrays of different pore diameters for detection of multiple types of biomarkers (i.e. DNA, charged proteins, amino acids, etc.).
2) Integration of the SeqLOW membranes into a microfluidic platform for in situ life detection. Microfluidics will be used to carry out sample processing, concentration, and delivery of the sample material to the solid-state membrane for analysis. Technologies and methods will be developed for sensor operation during deep space missions that eliminate: a) loss of analyte integrity, b) disruption of nanopore aperture, or c) disruption of pore current by sample interferences.
SeqLOW directly addresses the goals of the COLDTech program and NASA by “development of spacecraft-based instruments and technology for surface and subsurface exploration of ocean worlds such as Europa, Enceladus, and Titan.” SeqLOW also will address the NASA Planetary Science Division’s strategic goals and objectives and is focused on the detection of extant life in the “Ocean Worlds” of the outer Solar System.* [Raising the Technology Readiness Level of 4.7-THz local oscillators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w6rn-2xyh) - <p>The 63-&mu;m (4.744 THz) [OI] fine-structure line is the dominant cooling line of warm, dense, neutral atomic gas. Because of its great intensity in high UV photodissociation regions (PDRs) and shocks, the [OI] 63-&mu;m line is superior in probing regions of massive star formation and the centers of galaxies. It is a unique probe of PDRs, shock waves from stellar winds/jets, supernova explosions, and cloud-cloud collisions. These radiative and mechanical interactions shape the interstellar medium of galaxies and drives galactic evolution. The size scale of the interactions can excite [OI] emission over many parsecs. Moreover, the emission regions are often complex, with multiple energetic sources processing the environment. Spectrally resolved observations of the [OI] line with a heterodyne receiver array will allow users to disentangle this convoluted interaction and permit the study of the energy balance, physical conditions, morphology and dynamics of these extended regions. In this way, such a receiver array will provide new, unique, insights into the interrelationship of stars and gas in a wide range of galactic and extragalactic environments. Despite the great potential, however, astrophysical observation of the OI line has rarely been performed because the frequency (4.744THz) is beyond the reach of most of the implemented local oscillators (LOs) in sensitive heterodyne receivers involving cryogenic mixers. In this proposed 3-year project, we plan to raise the TRL of THz QCLs for local oscillator applications to 5 or beyond, so that we will bridge this &ldquo;mid-TRL gap&rdquo; between a promising and enabling technology and a mission-ready component. Such a development will significantly reduce the risk of several proposed suborbital projects such as GUSTO (The Gal/Xgal U/LDB Spectroscopic/Stratospheric THz Observatory) which is a long-duration balloon flight. The proposed systems includes a 9-element heterodyne receiver array for the 4.744-THz OI line. Those heterodyne receiver arrays will require a large LO power level in a good beam pattern. Specifically, by end of the proposed project, we will develop single-mode DFB lasers with frequency to be within 10 GHz of the target 4.744 THz line, cw output power of ~5 mW with a wall-plug power efficiency of ~0.5% at an operating temperature of ~40 K, and beam patterns narrower than 10&times;10 degrees. This proposed project mainly addresses NASA&#39;s Strategic Subgoal 3D, Discover the origin, structure, evolution, and destiny of the universe, and search for Earth-like planets. It also addresses NASA&#39;s Strategic Subgoal 3A, Study planet Earth from space to advance scientific understanding and meet societal needs; and NASA&#39;s Strategic Subgoal 3C, Advance scientific knowledge of the origin and history of the solar system, the potential for life elsewhere, and the hazards and resources present as humans explore space.</p>* [MISR Level 3 FIRSTLOOK Component Global Land Product covering a day V002](https://data.nasa.gov/d/suv3-tgge) - The MISR Level 3 FIRSTLOOK Component Global Land Product contains a daily statistical summary of directional hemispherical reflectance (DHR), photosynthetically active spectral region (DHR-PAR), DHR for near-infrared band (DHR-NIR), fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), DHR-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface bidectional reflectance factor (BRF) model parameters, classified into six vegetated and one non-vegetated types. This data product is a global summary of the Level 2 land/surface parameters of interest averaged over a day and reported on a geographic grid, with resolution of 0.5 degree by 0.5 degree. The data are for distinct regions associated with associated field campaigns. The FIRSTLOOK processing uses the new time dependence of the Atmospheric and Surface Climatology (TASC) from the same month/previous year. The TASC data set now contains snow-ice and ocean surface wind speed values that are updated on a monthly basis therefore, these data sets cannot be generated until the end of the month. Products generated are distinguished by the presence of FIRSTLOOK in the file names.The MISR instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras which measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global coverage is achieved in nine days. The cameras are arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir, four cameras pointing forward and four cameras pointing aftward. It takes 7 minutes for all ninecameras to view the same surface location. The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid, are 0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees. The spectral band shapes are nominally gaussian, centered at 443, 555, 670, and 865 nm.* [Data Reduction Techniques for Real-time Fault Detection and Diagnosis, and Multiple Fault Inference with Imperfect Tests, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9ujg-ifqj) - Limited downlink data rate constrains the amount of data that can be sent to earth from a spacecraft. Data from the onboard health monitoring sensors needs to be accommodated within a small fraction of this downlink bandwidth. The problem is more acute for interplanetary missions, where the downlink data rate is significantly lower than the low earth orbit missions. Such constraint prohibits transmission of the complete set of health monitoring data. 

This proposed Phase-II effort is geared towards providing enhanced remote diagnostics using limited telemetry bandwidth. Diagnostic accuracy of health management system depends more on the information content of the monitored data, than on its sheer volume. We propose accommodating more information within the allocated downlink bandwidth for health monitoring by performing intelligent data reduction. The onboard data reduction process employs sensor fusion, dimensionality reduction and temporal fusion techniques.* [MOPITT Gridded Monthly CO Retrievals (Near and Thermal Infrared Radiances) V006](https://data.nasa.gov/d/quug-jjpg) - The MOPITT L3 files contain daily and monthly mean gridded versions of the daily L2 CO profile and total column retrievals.

	We propose a three-year effort to upgrade our existing sub-arcsecond Lyman-alpha telescope payload to improve the observing cadence by a factor of 2, increase the signal-to-ratio by a factor of 4, and launch the payload twice. With this upgraded performance, we will be able to investigate a number of scientific questions regarding the structure and heating of the solar atmosphere that address NASA&amp;rsquo;s Strategic Goal to understand the Sun and its effects on Earth and the Solar System. Specifically, the ultra-high resolution and high-temporal cadence VAULT2.0 science program and associated launch campaigns will answer the following five questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;What is the role of Type-II spicules in the transfer of energy and mass across the chromosphere-corona interface? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;Does neutral plasma absorption of the EUV emission from active region moss explain the discrepancies in the models of coronal loop heating? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;Where are the photospheric footpoints of coronal loops? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;What is the structure of coronal holes in the Lyman-alpha temperature range? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	? &lt;em&gt;What is the absolute abundance of H I at the base of the solar wind? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite decades of ground-based observations, the chromosphere remains one of the least understood layers of the solar atmosphere because of our limited understanding of the physical processes that govern it. In the last few years, the chromosphere has been propelled to the forefront of solar physics research thanks to spectacular new observations from space (Hinode/SOT and VAULT), and ground (e.g., SOUP, IBIS, DOT, SST), and the advent of sophisticated numerical simulations which are beginning to address the complex physics of the optically thick chromospheric plasmas and are opening up the interpretation of the observations. With these new capabilities come exciting new ideas regarding the role of the chromosphere in supplying the mass and energy to heat the corona, the nature of filaments, and the contribution of chromospheric jets to the solar wind. These ideas are challenging our traditional views of coronal heating (a long-standing mystery of solar physics), the existence of the &amp;lsquo;transition region&amp;rsquo;, the role of neutral plasmas in coronal emission and even the dominance of magnetic fields at coronal heights. The recent SMEX selection of a chromosphere-oriented mission, IRIS, is further evidence for the renewed importance of chromospheric physics. Observational limitations, however, are impeding further development and validation of these ideas. &lt;strong&gt;Both theoretical and observational considerations point to the importance of tracing the mass and energy on &lt;em&gt;small spatial scales through the upper chromosphere and transition region &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(e.g., De Pontieu et al. 2007a, 2009, 2011; Vourlidas et al. 2010). This layer corresponds roughly to the temperature range from 10,000K (ground-based H&amp;alpha;) to 80,000K (space-based HeI). The requirement for high spatial- and temporal-resolution observations in this temperature range cannot be met fully by current instrumentation. Narrow-band, high-resolution images from TRACE, Hinode, STEREO and SOHO have inadequate temperature coverage or poor resolution. The SDO/AIA observations are skewed towards higher temperature plasmas. The SOHO spectrometers CDS and SUMER have good temperature coverage and fidelity, but limited spatial and temporal resolution and more importantly, limited operational lifetime. Hinode/EIS observations are mostly confined to the upper solar atmosphere while SOT observations are confined to the lower chromosphere (&amp;le; 10,000K). The forthcoming IRIS satellite will partially cover the gap between chromosphere and transition region by obtaini* [VIIRS/NPP Active Fires 6-Min L2 Swath 375m NRT](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gudv-u89p) - The VNP14IMG_NRT is a Near Real Time (NRT) S-NPP/VIIRS 375 m active fire detection data product (Schroeder 2014). The product is built on the EOS/MODIS fire product heritage [Kaufman et al., 1998; Giglio et al., 2003], using a multi-spectral contextual algorithm to identify sub-pixel fire activity and other thermal anomalies in the Level 1 (swath) input data. The algorithm uses all five 375 m VIIRS channels to detect fires and separate land, water, and cloud pixels in the image. Additional 750 m channels complement the available VIIRS multispectral data. Those channels are used as input to the baseline active fire detection product, which provides continuity to the EOS/MODIS 1 km Fire and Thermal Anomalies product.

The VIIRS 375 m fire detection data is a Level 2 product based on the input Science Data Record (SDR) Level 1 swath format. The NRT product is currently available through NASA?s the Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE). The data are formatted as HDF4 files. Complementary ASCII files containing the short list of fire pixels detected are also available through LANCE processing systems.

However, poor software reliability is a major impediment to the success of these mission-critical systems. Testing, formal verification, and code synthesis techniques have been proposed to achieve more reliable software, with automated code synthesis being the most promising method. But synthesizing a complex system from scratch is costly.  A more practical approach is to synthesize systems from existing components, i.e., component-based system synthesis (CBSS).  Existing research in CBSS focuses on synthesizing systems bottom-up, which has severe limitations.  We propose to achieve CBSS by combining the top-down and bottom-up approaches. Specifically, we develop techniques to achieve automated system decomposition and semi-automated system architecture synthesis.  The IDEAL decomposition technique decomposes a system into ``IDEAL'' units that are mathematically composable and can be developed and evolved independently.  Consequently, the technique assures system reliability and enables on-the-fly feature/technology upgrades. The QoS-based architecture synthesis technique seeks to assure system QoS properties by synthesizing an architecture that optimizes QoS objectives.  It also facilitates on-board system adaptation due to resource and power constraints. Combined with bottom-up techniques, such as Amphion and pattern-based code synthesis, a dramatic leap in automated CBSS capability can be achieved. The proposed research will lead to sophisticated automation for synthesizing highly reliable, multi-mission capable avionics and exploration systems.* [HELIX: The High Energy Light Isotope Experiment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vaef-dbnm) - This is the lead proposal for a new suborbital program, HELIX (High-Energy Light Isotope eXperiment), designed to make measurements of the isotopic composition of light cosmic-ray nuclei from ~200 MeV/nuc to ~10 GeV/nuc. Past measurements of this kind have provided profound insights into the nature and origin of cosmic rays, revealing, for instance, information on acceleration and confinement time scales, and exposing some conspicuous discrepancies between solar and cosmic-ray abundances. The most detailed information currently available comes from the ACE/CRIS mission, but is restricted to energies below a few 100 MeV/nuc. HELIX aims at extending this energy range by over an order of magnitude, where, in most cases, no measurements of any kind exist, and where relativistic time dilation affects the apparent lifetime of radioactive clock nuclei. The HELIX measurements will provide essential information for understanding the propagation history of cosmic rays in the galaxy. This is crucial for properly interpreting several intriguing anomalies reported in recent cosmic-ray measurements, pertaining to the energy spectra of protons, helium, and heavier nuclei, and to the anomalous rise in the positron fraction at higher energy.

HELIX employs a high-precision magnet spectrometer to provide measurements which are not achievable by any current or planned instrument. The superconducting magnet originally used for the HEAT payload in five successful high-altitude flights will be combined with state-of-the-art detectors to measure the charge, time-of-flight, magnetic rigidity, and velocity of cosmic-ray particles with high precision. The instrumentation includes plastic scintillators, silicon-strip detectors repurposed from Fermilab's CDF detector, a high-performance gas drift chamber, and a ring-imaging Cherenkov counter employing aerogel radiators and silicon photomultipliers. 

To reduce cost and technical risk, the HELIX program will be structured in two stages.  The first stage, which is the subject of this proposal, will focus on the design and construction of the main HELIX instrument, and the measurement of key light isotope ratios from ~200 MeV/n to ~3GeV/n.  A future stage 2 will build on this work, incorporating evolutionary enhancements to the instrumentation to extend the energy reach into the challenging ~10 GeV/n range.  The stage 1 instrument achieves a maximum detectable rigidity of ~800GV and charge range from Z=1 to Z=10. The high field of the HEAT magnet will make it possible to reach the required mass resolution dm/m = 2.5% over the energy range of concern with very small systematic limitations due to multiple Coulomb scattering in the thin tracker. This is a decisive advantage over the current AMS-02 instrument which employs a permanent magnet with an average field ~7 times smaller than that of HELIX.

The primary scientific goals of the full HELIX program are:

- a high-statistics measurement of the 10Be/9Be 'clock ratio' to ~10 GeV/nuc

- a high-statistics measurement of the 3He/4He ratio to ~12GeV/nuc

- the first measurements of 22Ne/20Ne above 1 GeV/nuc

- the first measurements of 7Li/6Li, and 10B/11B above 1 GeV//nuc

A number of secondary goals will also be pursued including the measurement of several other isotopic and elemental abundance ratios and fluxes, as well as the primary Helium flux to ~125 GeV/nuc, where there is currently disagreement between AMS-02 and PAMELA on the shape of the energy spectrum.

The proposed work will be conducted by a team of US scientists and engineers with extensive experience in cosmic-ray observations on balloons or in space, and, specifically in magnet spectroscopy, with the SMILI, P-BAR, and HEAT programs.  Significant participation from a crew of more than 10 graduate and undergraduate students forms an important educational element of the program.* [A Multiscale Approach to Magnesium Intercalation Batteries: Safer, Lighter, and Longer-Lasting](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mgy7-kmy8) - Lithium-ion batteries are the gold-standard for electrochemical energy storage; however, the ceiling for their storage potential is constrained by the most fundamental of limits: each lithium-ion only supplies one electron. Safety issues associated with lithium-ion batteries caused by uncontrollable growth of lithium-metal spikes that cause shorts the batteries and can lead to overheating and explosions of the battery as well as the flammability of many lithium-ion battery components are of great concern for the development of space technology and in particular the development of deep-space EVA suits. Broadly, my proposal is to move from lithium and towards magnesium-ion battery technology, by further developing a novel cathode material (one of only a handful in existence), Z-V2O5 which we have previously synthesized in our lab. This material is remarkable, and is capable of reversibly intercalating Mg at room temperature up to a high volumetric capacity. My primary objective is to further develop the nanostructuring of this material and optimize the battery chemistry in order to realize a fully functioning prototype magnesium-ion battery. Furthermore, I will use a variety of characterization and modeling techniques to evaluate this incredible material and inform principles for the intelligent and directed discovery of additional Mg-ion battery cathode materials. 

To accomplish these goals, I plan to utilize hydrothermal synthesis techniques coupled with structure-directing agents to optimize to optimize the nanostructuring of these materials. I plan to use a diverse palette of topochemical transformations to stabilize the desired empty host structures as well as facile techniques for chemically evaluating magnesium insertion behavior. I will quantify and evaluate the behavior of each phase using DFT+U and Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations to determine expected operating voltages and diffusion barriers. Finally, to evaluate the effects of phase segregation during magnesiation, I will utilize Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) to map electronic structure domains. 

Not only does moving from magnesium to lithium theoretically double the amount of charge per unit volume attainable in a cell, but it also allows for the use of Mg metal as an anode, eliminating the need for heavy anode components found in lithium ion batteries (Sn, C) inherently improving the weight of the overall battery. Most importantly, making the switch to magnesium makes batteries inherently safer because magnesium anodes do behave in the same way, forming metal spikes and so avoid the risk of thermal runaway. For these reasons, my proposed research addresses NASA interest in nanostructuring of cathode materials,  the development of safer batteries for human life-support systems, and the development of batteries pack more energy into lighter devices (TABS: 10.2.1.4, 3.2.1.1, and 3.2.1.4).* [Turbine Engine Performance Estimation using Particle Filters, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gsku-u4jr) - Development of a nonlinear particle filter for engine performance is proposed. The approach employs NASA high-fidelity C-MAPSS40K engine model as the central element, and addresses the issue of lack of observability of some of the engine health parameters in previous Kalman filter formulations. Proposed approach does not require linearity of the dynamics or Gaussian noise assumptions for satisfactory operation. The feasibility of real-time implementation of the proposed approach will be demonstrated using commercial, off-the-shelf General Purpose Graphical Processing Units.  Phase I feasibility demonstration will show that the particle filter formulation of the engine performance monitoring system can overcome the limitations of previously employed approaches. Phase II research will develop a prototype implementation for hardware-in-loop simulations and eventual flight test.* [An Approach to Health Management and Sustainability for Critical Aircraft Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fz6u-am26) - Impact Technologies, in collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology and its industrial partners, proposes to develop and demonstrate innovative technologies to integrate anomaly detection and failure prognosis algorithms into automated fault mitigation strategies for advanced aircraft controls. Traditional reactive fault tolerant control approaches fail to provide optimal fault mitigation over a long period of time to guarantee the integrity of the platform for the mission duration. We will create a generic simulation environment to demonstrate fault detection and progression at the component level, using electromechanical actuators as a testbench.  The proposed Anomaly Detection/Mitigation system accepts sensor inputs, extracts features from raw data and employs an anomaly detection module to determine the presence of an anomaly with performance guarantees; a prognostic routine, built on Bayesian estimation (particle filtering) techniques to estimate the remaining useful life of the component; finally, a mitigation strategy trades off between performance and control authority to extend the life of the failing component until the mission is completed. This innovative prognostics-enhanced approach to fault mitigation uses Model Predictive Control techniques running in real time. Core algorithms will be implemented on embedded systems and used in hardware-in-the-loop demonstrations.* [EUR-L4UHFND-MED-V01:1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rbdg-nyf3) - See the description of the EUR-L4UHRfnd-MED-ODYSSEA product* [LBA-ECO LC-03 SAR Images, Land Cover, and Biomass, Four Areas across Brazilian Amazon](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g6iu-2mfe) - This data set provides three related land cover products for four study areas across the Brazilian Amazon: Manaus, Amazonas; Tapajos National Forest, Para Western (Santarem); Rio Branco, Acre; and Rondonia, Rondonia.

The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products.KNOWN PROBLEMS: The data providers note that due to limited resources, these data have been neither validated nor quality-assured for general use. For that reason, extreme caution is advised when considering the use of these data.Any use of the derived data is not recommended because the results have not been validated. However, the DEM and vectors (related data set), and orthorectified SAR data can be used if the user understands how these were produced and accepts the limitations.* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vuh9-8uvt) - The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. FASIR-NDVI data are also used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface. There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.* [Global Soil Texture and Derived Water-Holding Capacities (Webb et al.)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jshw-bg9i) - A standardized global data set of soil horizon thicknesses and textures (particle size distributions).* [Continuous Electrode Inertial Electrostatic Confinement Fusion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4gjy-qz4d) - NASA recognizes within its roadmaps (specifically TA 3.1.6) that development of aneutronic fusion (such as p-11B) reactors with direct energy conversion (>80%) would be an enabling technology to achieve low specific mass (kg/kW) through the elimination of shielding and potentially the need for dedicated radiators. In addition, material activation due to neutron capture could be avoided. The challenge is of course to develop a plasma confinement system that is far less massive than the current leading (magnetic/inertial) approaches, but consumes less power than is generated by the fusion process – a feat that has yet to be achieved even terrestrially. Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) techniques offer the possible advantage of considerably lower mass, however they suffer from limitations that have hampered their development, just as plasma instabilities have hampered the development of magnetic systems. The difference is that considerable time, effort and funding have gone into the engineering of solutions to the plasma instability problem, whereas the limitations of IEC have always been viewed as “too fundamental”. The objectives of the proposed research are therefore two-fold: 1) To retire the broad fundamental criticisms of IEC devices by demonstrating feasible engineering solutions, and 2) To develop a comprehensive system-level performance model to support parametric scaling.

The impact of successfully achieving the target specific mass of 2 kg/kW can be seen in the context of the previously proposed JIMO spacecraft. The full dry mass was about 24 metric tons, with 12 metric tons of Xe propellant. The fission reactor module mass was estimated at just over 6 tons, not including roughly 2 tons of radiator mass. At a power output of 200 kWe, the specific mass of the full power system (reactor+radiators) would have been about 40 kg/kW. At a target specific mass of ~2kg/kW, the same power system would have a mass of only 400 kg, saving 7.5 tons of dry mass and 3.5 tons of propellant. This is just over 30% reduction in total mass to orbit, at a savings of $220M. It is also worth noting that the fuel mass (assuming p-11B @ = 80%) for the entire 20 year mission design life, if operating continuously at 200 kWe, would amount to ~2.3 kg.

Phase I of the research will be primarily dedicated to the development of the performance model to help motivate the efficacy of the approach in advance of Phase II. However, some effort in Phase I will address the key criticism of IEC devices, namely that of thermalization, through numerical simulation. In Phase II, more detailed modeling and numerical simulation of electron confinement within the device core, energy loss paths, and direct energy conversion of the fusion products will be done. The results of the Phase II effort would then be incorporated into a technology development plan.* [Familiarization and Detection of Green Monopropellants](https://data.nasa.gov/d/49sb-nd4s) - <p>Ammonium dinitramide (ADN) and hydroxyl ammonium nitrate (HAN) are &quot;green&rdquo; monopropellants which will be appearing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for processing in the next few years. These are relatively safe replacements for hydrazine as a monopropellant; however, little is known about methods of leak detection, vapor scrubbing, air emissions, or cleanup that will be required for safe and environmentally benign operations at KSC.&nbsp;</p> <p>ADN was developed by the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), while HAN was developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory to be a propellant. Alliant Techsystems Inc (ATK) is predominantly evaluating ADN for future use, while Ball Aerospace was awarded a NASA Technology Demonstration Mission (TDM) to use HAN as a monopropellant to be launched from KSC/Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

Simulants are employed on earth to verify the performance of equipment, mechanisms, structures and processes to be used on the lunar surface.  One of the significant limitations of current simulants is the lack of constituents, such as agglutinates and spherules, which often contain nano-phase iron (Fe0).  These constituents are needed in any high fidelity simulant.  Recently, Plasma Processes, Inc. (PPI) has developed a process to create simulated agglutinates and volcanic glasses from JSC-1A lunar regolith simulant.  Microstructural characterization has shown that these components contain an appreciable amount of nano phase Fe0.  However, current production of these simulant additives is limited.  The ultimate objective of this Phase I effort is to develop an economical, large scale manufacturing process to produce simulant agglutinates and volcanic glasses.  This production process promises to be a viable route for significantly enhancing the fidelity of existing and future lunar regolith simulants.* [Doppler Lidar for Measurement of High-Altitude Aircraft Wake Vortices](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9aei-ybvm) - <p>We are developing a Doppler lidar technology for detecting and measuring wake vortices of aircraft. This lidar has been largely developed for meteorological applications, and we are exploring its adaptation to use in this aeronautics application. Wake vortex considerations are important in preventing harmful turbulence encounters in our nation's airspace.<p/><p>While ground-based Doppler lidar has been used to probe wakes of landing aircraft for many years, these lidars are of a low pulse energy (a few millijoules) that limits their use to short ranges and low altitudes within the atmospheric boundary layer. With NASA's advancement of high pulse energy (250-millijoules) lidar, aircraft wakes could now be measured at long ranges and high altitudes. A ground-based lidar could be used to measure wakes of overflying aircraft to altitudes as high at 20,000 feet. Furthermore, the high-energy lidar could be installed in an aircraft to measure the wakes of other aircraft in flight. The Airspace Systems Program (ASP) is committed to the development of Super Density Operations (SDO) concepts for NextGen. Wake vortices are a fundamental physical limitation that will need to be resolved to enable these SDOs. Understanding wake vortices is a crucial step in the path to NextGen. Under ASP, NASA's wake vortex prediction model development is world-class and is actively involved in both development and validation of these wake models. Access to previously unavailable enroute wake data that would result from this effort represents a huge opportunity to help enable the NextGen goals by providing the ability to conduct robust model validation critical to enabling SDO concepts. To start the development of measuring aircraft wakes from a distant location, we are having an aircraft fly over the lidar in such a way that the aircraft's wakes will drift over the lidar's beam. By placing the target wakes at a known location, we will capture the signal's indicative of a wake vortex. An automated algorithm could then be developed to automatically scan for and lock onto a wake vortex signature. We are also making preliminary designs of adapting the lidar's operation in an aircraft for currently-used meteorological wind measurements to wake vortex measurements. These changes are in the scan pattern of the lidar beam and signal processing.</p>* [NONA Cure of Prepreg Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n3fr-ckaj) - CRG's no-oven, no-autoclave (NONA) composite processing technology enables the fabrication of high-performance composite parts without the limitations imposed by autoclaves and ovens. The NONA infusion and cure of autoclave prepreg materials allows the manufacture of large primary composite structures without the expensive and energy-intensive capital equipment currently required for fabrication. The NONA process enables the remote fabrication of complex, integrated structures, dramatically shifting the composites manufacturing paradigm. Qualified autoclave or OoA prepreg tapes can be applied simultaneously with dry unidirectional (UD) tapes in an automated process. The presence of dry fibers throughout the layup before infusion allows improved breathing, removal of volatiles from prepreg, and improved compaction with only atmospheric pressure, mimicking the double vacuum debulk (DVD) process without the added equipment. NONA resin is then introduced to the evacuated layup at ambient temperature to wet out all available contact surfaces and cure itself and the prepreg in place. The NONA epoxy resin uses its own chemical energy to propel itself through a complete cure with no external heat required. With a high degree of crosslinking, the baseline NONA resin provides good strength, chemical resistance, and thermal performance up to 350 degrees F. Pairing NONA resin with a compatible prepreg, such as IM7/Cycom 977-3 or Hexcel IM7/8552-1, a cure of both systems can be achieved at room temperature. Because the cure occurs at room temperature, the NONA resin locks in its shape near room temperature, thus allowing the use of low-cost tooling materials, typically avoided because the of high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).* [High-Performance Warm-Gas Thrusters for Micro/Nanosatellites, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gj69-73xc) - The current push to develop small satellites, referred to as microsatellites (<100 kg) and nanosatellites (<10 kg), has resulted in the need to miniaturize several key technologies, including the propulsion system. Trade studies have been performed for these small satellites, and optimization of the propulsion system with respect to mass shows that cold-gas systems will result in the lowest overall system mass despite their low specific impulse. One way to improve the overall performance of a cold-gas propulsion system without suffering a weight penalty is to use Tridyney instead of helium or nitrogen cold gas. Tridyne, a non-explosive mixture of nitrogen (or helium), hydrogen, and oxygen, offers a 20-28% increase in specific impulse over nitrogen. The limitation of Tridyne for small satellites is that the particle size of commonly used granular catalysts is unsuitably large for use in a micronewton thruster. Coarse particles will result in propellant channeling with little reaction taking place, and a loss of performance. In this project, Ultramet proposes to build upon its experience with monolithic catalyst beds and develop a small, low pressure drop, monolithic catalyst bed optimized for use with Tridyne.* [Development of Advanced Detonation Modeling Methods for Hydrocarbon Propellants, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qz3i-5p4q) - Many modern liquid rocket propulsion systems are utilizing hydrocarbon propellants (e.g. methane, RP-1). Testing of these new rocket systems will inherently involve the potential for large energy explosions. Current engineering methods do not address the probability of a detonation occurring and they are extremely conservative by attempting to equate the propellant vapor cloud explosion to a high-density explosive. The current project is leveraging CIF FY15 work done by NASA-SSC in which a validated tool for modeling hydrogen detonation and blast wave propagations in test facilities by following on to validate engineering level approaches for modeling the potential and associated blast environments for explosions of these hydrocarbon propellants.* [Propulsive Descent Technology (PDT) Original Content](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gj28-293x) - Current technology does not support Mars human missions due to limitations in capability to land high mass support hardware.  If we want to send people to Mars, we need to provide a new propulsive descent capability that extends to supersonic speeds and is applicable to human missions.* [RIDES: Raman Icing Detection System, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rnac-b4qp) - Inflight icing of engines and airframe presents a significant hazard to air transport, especially at lower flight elevations during take-off or on approach.  Ice accretions on the wings affect the smooth flow required for proper lift. A thin layer of coarse ice can reduce the lift by 30 percent and increase drag by up to 40 percent.  In addition, accretions can also reduce the air intake in engines and affect readings from a (heated) Pitot tube. Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) proposes to continue the development of an integrated LIDAR instrument capable of identifying icing conditions while also allowing for air data sensing as well as other hazard detection capabilities.  The resulting Raman Icing Detection System (RIDES), when coupled with MAC's optical air data solution, will provide unprecedented situational awareness and aircraft safety. The proposed solution will operate without protrusions into the flow, behind a common flush-mounted window on the skin of the aircraft, mitigating the risk of ice build-up during operation and therefore providing a critical redundancy through dissimilar measurement of air data parameters while greatly enhancing a pilot's awareness of potential icing hazards.  MAC will build on its successful Phase I trade-study and design effort through the fabrication and demonstration of a Phase II prototype in an icing wind tunnel.* [SEDIMENT ANALYSIS NETWORK FOR DECISION SUPPORT (SANDS) LANDSAT GEOTIFF V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n7xc-tf8u) - The Sediment Analysis Network for Decision Support (SANDS) analyzes Geotiff images for sediment redistribution after a hurricane on the Gulf coast and then creates a product based on the analysis.

Despite the uncertainties inherent to the nuclear disruption approach, disruption can become an effective strategy if most fragments disperse at speeds in excess of the escape velocity of an asteroid so that a very small number of fragments impacts the Earth. Thus, the proposed HAIV system will become essential for reliably mitigating the most probable impact threat: NEOs with warning times shorter than 10 years. It offers a potential breakthrough or great leap in mission capabilities for mitigating the impact threat of NEOs. The proposed Phase II study further develops the HAIV-based mission architecture and explores its potential infusion options within NASA and beyond.</p>* [AES Modular Power Systems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vhp4-mc74) - <p>The AES Modular Power Systems (AMPS) project will demonstrate and infuse modular power electronics, batteries, fuel cells, and autonomous control for exploration ground system demonstrations; assess and provide recommendations for improvements of proposed power systems for other Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) projects/HEOMD&nbsp;demonstration systems; and develop modular power design concepts that will guide the ground system demonstrations and modular component and assembly development for the duration of this project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The goals of this project are to develop modular power design systems and components for human exploration flight vehicles; &nbsp;assess, develop, and/or improve power system designs for AES/HEOMD ground/flight demonstrations; demonstrate modular power design systems, by participating in annual ground demonstrations, infusing power technologies developed by the Space Technology Program Game Changing Development (GCD) Space Power Systems (SPS) project, Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR), and other government agencies as practicable; demonstrate and verify the operation of the modular power systems in a relevant, end-to-end, ground test environment; and develop modular power units which, when combined with standardized interfaces can provide commonality across a variety of exploration vehicles and guide AES ground system demonstrations.

This architecture integrats Flush Air Data System (FADS) with Reconfigurable Generalized Predictive Control (RGPC) technologies.  The Phase 1 effort includes identification and description of all supporting modules, their functionality and associated algorithm structures, connectivity, and final simulations using a specific aircraft for system performance evaluations.  Proof-of-concept study will include demonstrating the capability using selected aircraft health degradation and/or failure situations.  The concept innovation is derived from the prognostic nature of the system feedback used by the controller for applying corrective aircraft control.  In traditional controllers the errant transients possessing loss of control potential are detected after the fact and corrective actions for recovery are commanded by controller posteriori. The proposed system performs a real-time autonomous monitoring of aircraft surface pressure fields that contain precursor information for prediction of incipient errant transient motions.  The proposed system will enable reconfiguration of control based on measured pressure field anomalies that indicate standard control system equipment malfunctions.* [Neural Network Enhanced Structure Determination of Osteoporosis, Immune System, and Radiation Repair Proteins, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/k6us-47ff) - We propose a dual objective innovation that has valuable NASA applicability and tremendous commercial potential.  The first innovation is the structure determination of osteoporosis, immune system diseases, and radiation damage repair proteins utilizing proprietary neural network based algorithms.  The long-term results from this innovation could provide effective medical countermeasures for bone loss, immune system compromise and harmful radiation effects seen in astronauts upon long-duration space missions. The second innovation is a commercial grade multipurpose neural network based informatics system configurable for automated, real-time sensory data input and automatic correlation identification applicable to autonomous astronaut health monitoring and environmental correlation.  This innovation also has significant commercial applications in the health care industries as a hospital wide health monitoring and environmental correlation system.* [Virtual Sensor Test Instrumentation, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/m8r8-ynv7) - Mobitrum has started the development of virtual sensor test instrumentation in Phase I for characterization and measurement of ground testing of propulsion systems.  It is clear that future wide availability of smart sensors will significantly reduce the cost and time required to design, repair, or modify sensor systems through modular and re-configurable capability.  The Phase II effort will complete the development of: 1) common sensor interface, (2) microprocessor, (3) wireless interface, (4) signal conditioning and ADC/DAC, and (5) on-board EEPROM for metadata storage and executable software to create powerful, scalable, re-configurable, and reliable distributed test instrument. The transducer senses the physical quantity being measured and converts it into an electrical signal. Then the signal is fed to an A/D converter, and is ready for use by the processor to execute functional transformation based on the sensor characteristics stored in TEDS. In order to maximize the data efficiency, a plug-and-play is required to interface with traditional sensors to enhance their identity and capabilities for data processing and communications.  Virtual sensor test instrumentation is built upon open-system architecture with standardized protocol modules/stacks easily to interface with industry standards and commonly used software such as IEEE 1451, MATLAB, and LabVIEW.* [Pyramid Nanostructured Coatings for Stray Light Suppression, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yv3r-xaps) - State of the Art In-Space Telescopic imagery suffers from deleterious effects of image quality due to radiation, in the form of stray visible light.  While treatments to reduce the impact of stray light exist, the effectiveness of these treatments have limitations thereby limiting the range and reliability of astrophysical telescopic imagery.  NASA is seeking a scalable, highly effective solution to reduce and/or eliminate the impact of stray light.
Applied Sciences, Inc. (ASI) proposes Applied Sciences proposes a unique solution for stray light suppression in space flight instruments. The innovation utilizes non-reflective/ nano-structured polymer coatings combined with a proven and scalable process that yields a light trapping nano-textured surface.  Stacked-cup carbon nanotubes will provide additional absorptive properties to a currently-used aerospace qualified resin system (legacy material). A non-reflecting surface will be fabricated by plasma etching and replication into pyramidal nanostructures for broadband absorption with efficiency at or better than 99.9%. This new approach comes at a much lower cost, is readily scalable and safer than the competing technology. ASI has previous success formulating spray-able room temperature cured coatings with tailored reflectivity and is working with U.S. Air Force to scale-up the nanomaterial enhanced coatings manufacturing capability.  That separate effort, and the use of a (modified/enhanced-) legacy material, will benefit the proposed effort as it will enable rapid verification, qualification, and transition of the technology.* [Hybrid Heat Pipes for High Heat Flux Applications, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qqei-vg7s) - The thermal transport requirements for future spacecraft missions continue to increase, approaching several kilowatts. At the same time the heat acquisition areas have trended downward, thereby increasing the incident heat flux. Current incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2. This is a severe limitation for axial groove aluminum/ammonia constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs). The maximum heat flux in a CCHP is set by the boiling limit, which typically start at 5 W/cm2 for axial grove wicks, and 20-30 W/cm2 for powder metal wicks. The innovation is to develop CCHPs with either a sintered wick, or a hybrid grooved and sintered wick. A hybrid grooved and sintered wick CCHP will allow operating at higher heat fluxes as compared to axial groove design and can also operate against gravity on the planetary surface, operate in space, carrying power over long distances, act as a thermosyphon on the planetary surface for Lunar and Martian landers and rovers, and demonstrate a higher transport capability than an all-sintered wick.* [Lightweight Pump Technology for Advanced Green Monopropellants, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jeyj-qgde) - Systima will develop an innovative light weight self-pressurizing pump (SPP) technology to provide a constant-pressure supply of monopropellant to a spacecraft or tactical propulsion system. The SPP does not require a helium tank and higher operating pressure have a negligible impact on the system mass.  Since the SPP has a lower weight than comparable propellant pressurization systems, it provides an opportunity for reducing launch costs, increasing spacecraft or tactical system payload capacity and significantly enhancing delta velocity/λV.  This technology can be used with hydrazine, HAN-based, or ADN-based propellants as there are no known limitations on the monopropellant that can be used in the system.  The self-pressurizing lightweight pump for advanced monopropellants offers significant advantages in applications where a large λV is required, such as large spacecraft or in applications where high-pressure is needed, such as liquid ACS or DACS thrusters.   The Phase I and Phase II SBIR will focus on development of the system for operation with the HAN-based monopropellant AF-M315E.* [Consistent Practices for Characterizing the Detection Limits of Fracture Critical Metallic Component Inspection Systems](https://data.nasa.gov/d/26qi-7eef) - <p>NASA-STD-5009 requires that successful flaw detection by NDE methods be statistically qualified for use on fracture critical metallic components using Probability of Detection (POD) studies, but does not standardize practices. This task works towards standardizing calculations and record retention with a web-based tool, the NASA POD Standards Library, or NPSL. Best practices for test methods and specimen storage will also be provided&nbsp;with appendices to NASA-STD-5009, which is currently unded revision.&nbsp;Additionally, this appendix will describe how POD specimens used to qualify NDE systems will be cataloged, stored and protected from corrosion, damage, or loss.</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Flaw detection capability&nbsp;is established for inspection systems on the basis of Probability of Detection (POD).&nbsp; The commonly accepted metric for an adequate inspection system is as follows:&nbsp;for a minimum flaw size which is smaller than the critical defect being sought,&nbsp;there is 90% probability of detection with 95% confidence (90/95 POD). &nbsp;Inspection systems that are incapable of meeting the 90/95 POD requirement at or below the critical defect level for fracture critical components are deemed&nbsp;unsuitable for that inspection. &nbsp;</p><p>To provide an efficient and accurate methodology that yields estimates of POD and confidence bounds for&nbsp;Hit-Miss or signal amplitude testing the directed design of experiments for probability of detection (DOEPOD) method has been developed.&nbsp; In DOEPOD, signal amplitudes are reduced to Hit-Miss data by defining a signal threshold.&nbsp; The directed DOEPOD method uses&nbsp;a nonparametric approach for the analysis of inspection data which, unlike other methods,&nbsp;does not rely on simlifying assumptions regarding&nbsp;the&nbsp;general form of a POD function.&nbsp; This differs with other methods&nbsp;that define a POD&nbsp;curve based on a curve fit and does not assume increasing detection with increasing flaw sizes that can often be proven untrue.&nbsp; For a given sample set, the DOEPOD procedure identifies whether&nbsp;the minimum requirement of 90% probability of detection with 95% confidence is demonstrated for a minimum flaw size and for all greater flaw sizes (90/95 POD).&nbsp; These procedures are sequentially executed&nbsp;to minimize the number of samples needed to demonstrate that there is a 90/95 POD lower confidence bound at a given flaw size and that the POD is monotonic for flaw sizes exceeding that 90/95 POD flaw size.</p><p>This work provides strong experimental and simulation evidence that&nbsp;a 90/95 POD flaw size will be identified by DOEPOD 95% of the time if it exists, and the procedures will yield a determination that the POD is non-monotonic 97% of the time when it is non-monotonic.&nbsp; Based on this evidence, the DOEPOD methodology may be used to reduce mission risk by quantifiably meeting the requirements of NASA-STD-5009, &ldquo;Nondestructive Evaluation Requirements for Fracture Critical Metallic Components.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Approach</strong></p><p>A total of 860 metal specimens have been produced with a selection of fatigue cracks, fastener hole cracks, lack of weld fusion, and electrical discharge machined (EDM) flaws. &nbsp;The metals used in this study are common throughout aerospace, and include aluminum, titanium, nickel-chromium alloy, and stainless steel. &nbsp;Flat plates and tubes with programmed defects are being&nbsp;examined.&nbsp; These specimens are being examined&nbsp;with x-ray radiography with differing film densities, digital radiography, ultrasound (including phased array), eddy current (including automated methods), florescent penetrant testing (L3 &amp; L4), magnetic particle testing, and visual testing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customers</strong></p><p>All NASA centers and missions utilizing failure critical components.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Products</strong></p* [High Capacity, High Efficiency 10 to 20 K Pulse Tube Cryocooler, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ishz-y7jg) - Closed-cycle cryocooler alternatives currently available for space applications in the temperature range of 10 to 20 K are not well suited to the requirements of such applications. In many cases reliability is low and vibration high. In other cases, coolers are too massive and inefficient. However, such coolers are often important components in enabling many of the advanced sensor and detector technologies of the future. This proposal describes a two-stage pulse tube cooler (PTC) that combines a bootstrap staging configuration with an innovative second-stage design to deliver cooling in the range of 10 to 20 K. The proposed cooler contains four innovative concepts that together will overcome the limitations of current cryocooler technologies and improve efficiency while simultaneously reducing mass.* [SAFARI 2000 Surface Irradiance Measurements, Mongu Tower Site, Zambia, 2000-2002](https://data.nasa.gov/d/eqs5-thym) - ABSTRACT: This data set contains the top-of-canopy irradiance in the shortwave (0.3-2.8 micron) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 0.4-0.7 micron) wavebands collected with an Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometer (PSP) and a Skye SKE510 pyranometer, respectively. The instruments were deployed at the top of the 30-m tower in the Kataba Local Forest approximately 20 km south of Mongu in Western Province, Zambia. The data include the hourly mean and maximum values from 0500-1600 GMT (7 a.m. - 6 p.m. local time) and cover the period from September 4, 2000 to December 31, 2002. The data were obtained primarily for EOS validation and energy budget modeling.The Skye SKE510 uses a blue enhanced planar diffused silicon detector and has a fairly even response from 400 to 700 nm. The Eppley PSP is a World Meteorological Organization First Class Radiometer designed for the measurement of sun and sky radiation, totally or in defined broad wavelength bands. It comprises a circular multi-junction wire-wound thermopile. A data logger sampled the sensors at 60-second intervals and recorded the maximum and mean values every 60 minutes throughout the day.The data are contained within a single ASCII text file, in comma-separated-value format, with associated date, time, and QA information.* [AutoNav Mark 4: Autonomous Navigation Software, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/km9m-7fb8) - The growing number of missions in deep space, from Discovery class missions like Psyche and Lucy down to very small spacecraft like Lunar Flashlight, is driving the need for standardized, flexible, full-featured flight software for spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control (GNC). Autonomous GNC allows a spacecraft to perform most of its own navigation activities without the need for ground-based personnel and DSN time, reducing cost and required DSN contact time, saving money, and allowing specialized navigation personnel from different NASA centers to be easily shared among missions.

Autonomous GNC activities include:
  -spacecraft positioning
    absolute and relative (helio, planet, small-body)
    relative to small bodies, other spacecraft for rendezvous
  -orbit determination
  -target tracking of bodies, apertures, spacecraft, ground-based assets
  -trajectory derivation
  -low-thrust maneuvering for Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP)
  -ephemeris calculations

AutoNav from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory implements these functions, and components have flown on Deep Space 1 and Deep Impact. With an appropriate application of software development process to reengineer the code, a new AutoNav Mark 4 could be made available as a commercialized product meeting NASA Class B software standards, thereby enabling its easy inclusion on a wide variety of NASA and non-NASA missions.

AutoNav Mark 4 source code is designed and tested to be compatible with a variety of different CPUs (e.g. SPARC, PPC, Intel), real-time operating systems (VxWorks, RTEMS), and flight software cores like NASA Core Flight System. This approach allows AN4 to be deployed in the widest-possible set of environments:
  -within STRS-compatible space radios (e.g. Iris)
  -in the flight software load of the spacecraft C&DH
  -in a dedicated stand-alone instrument like the Deep Space Positioning System

AutoNav Mark 4 provides highly capable autonomous GNC while saving missions money.* [Follow-On Shaft Seal Evaluation for Future OMS Engine Series Valve Derivations](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xz62-uvh8) - <p>The objective of this project is to characterize/determine the conditions under which propellant vapor migrates/permeates past the Orbital Maneuvering Subsystem Engine (OMS-E) series valve ball valve pinion shaft seals into the series valve actuators.  Initial testing was performed in fiscal year (FY) 2012 and continued in FY 2013.<p/><p>Evidence of nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and monomethylhydrazine (MMH) propellant vapor leakage across the primary and secondary shafts seals of the four OMS-E series valve ball valve pinions have been found on nearly all OMS engines processed at the NASA White Sands Test Facility since 1996. This leakage results in various forms of internal damage to series valve ball valve pinions and actuator assembly components.  Two in-flight anomalies occurred during Shuttle flight history (STS-91 OMS-E serial number [S/N] 107; and STS-101 on OMS-E S/N 111) that were direct results of propellant vapor leakage. Testing was performed in FY 2012 and 2013 to attempt to characterize/determine the conditions under which the vapors migrate/permeate past the redundant (primary and secondary) shafts seals on the ball valve pinions and into the actuator housings.  In FY 2012 a "simple soak" test was performed in which NTO and MMH were introduced into their respective cavities in a flight series valve and vapor break-through monitored downstream of the primary and secondary shaft seals of each of the four ball valves using vapor detection devices.  The follow-on testing performed in FY 2013 focuses on the MMH part of the series valve.  In this test, MMH is introduced into the cavity between the fuel ball valves, the cavity pressurized to 250 pounds per square inch gage (psig), and monitoring performed downstream of the primary and secondary shaft seals using vapor detection devices. FY 2012 soak tests resulted in evidence of NTO vapor permeation past the primary and secondary shaft seals of the oxidizer ball valves in 2.5 and 18.5 hours respectively.  While MMH vapor permeation was measured at the primary shaft seal locations of the fuel ball valves in 1.5 hours, no evidence of permeation past the secondary shaft seal was measured after 6 weeks of data logging.  This resulted in the follow-on test in FY 2013 to add pressurization of the fuel ball valve cavity to determine if this would result in MMH vapor measurements downstream of the fuel ball valve secondary shaft seal locations.  FY 2013 testing will be completed by September 2013 and results compiled in a test report.</p>* [Global Cyclone Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qr4m-czu6) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI) Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation (WASP). Utilizing average monthly precipitation data from 1980 through 2000 at a resolution of 2.5 degrees, WASP assesses the precipitation deficit or surplus over a three month temporal window that is weighted by the magnitude of the seasonal cyclic variation in precipitation. The three months' averages are derived from the precipitation data and the median rainfall for the 21 year period is calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells where the three month running average of precipitation is less than 1 mm per day ae excluded. Drought events are identified when the magnitude of a monthly precipitation deficit is less than or equal to 50 percent of its longterm median value for three or more consecutive months. Grid cells are then divided into 10 classes having an approximately equal number of grid cells. Higher grid cell values denote higher frequencies of drought occurrences. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Development of Optics and Detectors for Advanced CMB Polarization Measurements](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2w4g-93cf) - Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have been essential to the development of modern cosmology. Future observations will provide cosmological constraints from structure formation as well as improved characterization of inflation in the early universe.  Starting in 2008, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) measured the CMB temperature on arcminute scales, discovered galaxy clusters through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and when combined with measurements from NASA's WMAP satellite provided evidence for the existence of dark energy for the first time using CMB measurements alone.  With this NSTRF fellowship I plan to work towards the development of optics and detector technologies for a next generation instrument to be deployed on ACT. ACT is a six-meter telescope located in the Atacama Desert in Chile at an elevation of 5190 m. A polarization sensitive upgrade to ACT, known as ACTPol, is now beginning observations. Throughout the length of the fellowship, we will work to implement and observe with ACTPol. We will be able to study the growth of cosmic structure in our universe via detections of galaxy clusters and gravitational lensing of the CMB and will improve constraints on cosmological parameters that describe the early universe.

With the use of approximately 3,000 superconducting detectors operating at 90 GHz and 150 GHz, ACTPol will enable high precision measurements of the polarization of the CMB.  One of my goals during the fellowship is to help develop a future upgrade to ACT that will provide wider frequency coverage with many more detectors. An important aspect of this project will be research into reading out larger superconducting detector arrays, which could impact technologies for future NASA space missions, such as a next generation X-ray observatory or the Inflation Probe.  This as well as research on silicon optics will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. The optics research is relevant to measurements over a wide range of wavelengths, from far infrared to millimeter wave, and could be used on future NASA missions at these wavelengths. The research conducted under this fellowship will contribute towards improving the technology readiness levels of all the associated technologies for use in future NASA missions.* [Task-Specific Asteroid Simulants for Ground Testing, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/efuk-z4ht) - The project will produce at least four asteroid simulants at high fidelity for mineral content and particle size, created through standardized inputs and documented processes.  In addition to making simulant available at moderate cost compared to duplicative individual efforts, this initial library of pedigreed asteroid simulants will enable researchers and technology developers to compare their results with others using the library, and with their own previous experiments using the library. The downside of uncoordinated, undocumented, dissimilar simulants is the wasting of time and financial resources, as well as the risk of misleading results from the use of inappropriate or low-fidelity materials.* [Hydrocarbon Leak Detection Sensor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wptu-32qn) - FTT is proposing the development of a sensor to detect the presence of hydrocarbons in turbopump Inter-Propellant Seals (IPS).  The purpose of the IPS is to prevent the fuel (RP-2) and oxidizer (LOX) from mixing by using an inert purge gas; however, a major risk of the IPS is RP-2 wicking into the buffer or LOX cavities, threatening ignition with the LOX.  The proposed sensor will detect the presence of hydrocarbons and signal the health management system to safely shutdown.  It will increase the reliability of the IPS, and decrease turnaround time between missions by eliminating the need for manual inspections for hydrocarbons in the IPS.
	There are two main technical objectives for Phase I.  First is to research and test various hydrocarbon indicators to determine which materials can detect the presence of hydrocarbons by either changing color or intensity.  The second objective is to research and test various optical viewing devices and data processing devices to determine which mechanism can adequately capture the color or intensity change of the hydrocarbon indicator and signal that the change has occurred.  The sensor will be comprised of the feasible components determined during Phase I, and tested in a rig in Phase II.* [Activity modeling under uncertainty by trace of objects in smart homes](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cstk-9fa3) - A typical resident of a smart home can be an Alzheimer patient that forgets sometimes to complete the activities that he begins. The key point to assist the smart home resident is to model the activities and discover correct realization patterns of activities. To accomplish this task, we apply sensors to provide primary data about realization patterns of actions, operations, plans, goals and generally any objective that the smart home resident may desire to do. In the consequence, by applying fuzzy clustering techniques, we are able to mine sensor data to retrieve the realization patterns of activities, and so the prediction patterns of intentions are recognizable. Comparing the realization patterns with prediction patterns of activities, we would be able to predict the intention of the resident about the activity that the resident considers to realize. In this way, we would be able to provide hypotheses about the resident goals and his possible goal achievement’s defects. Spatiotemporal aspects of daily activities such as movement of objects are surveyed to discover the patterns of activities realized by the smart homes residents. In this research, uncertainty is considered as a property of activity recognition.* [LBA-ECO LC-03 Hypsography, Rivers, Roads, and DEM, Four Areas across Brazilian Amazon](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nvz7-z46g) - ABSTRACT: This data set provides four related spatial data products for four study areas across the Brazilian Amazon: Manaus, Amazonas; Tapajos National Forest, Para Western (Santarem); Rio Branco, Acre; and Rondonia, Rondonia. Products include vector data showing (1) roads, (2) rivers, and (3) hypsography and (4) digital elevation model (DEM) images that were encoded from the hypsography vectors. There are 15 data files with this data set which includes 12 compressed *.zip files containing ArcInfo shape files and 3 GeoTIFFS.This data set contains vector data showing roads, rivers, and hypsography for each study area in ESRI ArcGIS shapefile format. The vectors were hand-digitized by the Images Company in Brazil from paper maps produced by the Brazilian government. Depending on the scale of the original maps, the digitization errors vary. For some maps, some vectors are missing. Data were manually checked for duplicate or extra vectors. These data sets were derived from several map sheets produced from aerial coverages dating from 1974 to 1978.The DEM images were encoded from the hypsography vectors and are provided in GeoTIFF format. The attribute value associated with each line and point in the vector segment is encoded into the image channel; the image channel is then filled in by interpolating image data between encoded vector data.  For each DEM:  1 image channel with pixel resolution = 25m x 25m.  DEM images are provided for Manaus, Tapajos National Forest, and Rondonia.  The files for Rio Branco were unusable due to a documentation error.DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products. KNOWN PROBLEMS:The data providers note that due to limited resources, these data have been neither validated nor quality-assured for general use. For that reason, extreme caution is advised when considering the use of these data. - Any use of the derived data is not recommended because the results have not been validated.- However, the DEM, vectors, and orthorectified SAR data (related data set) can be used if the user understands how these were produced and accepts the limitations.* [SASSI: Subsystems for Automated Subsurface Sampling Instruments, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3va7-wbue) - Autonomous surface sampling systems are necessary, near term, to construct a historical view of planetary significant events; as well as allow for the identification of materials useful for ISRU activities. Paramount to this is exploration missions capable of in-situ analysis of core samples that deliver the stratigraphy of the target. These sample handling technologies must be developed to meet a broad range of potential requirements, including a variety of rock or subsurface materials, rigorous sample preservation requirements, and the general problem of autonomous operation in the presence of dust and with limited resources. Honeybee seeks to develop critical subsystems for a small, low-mass, low-power Rotary-Percussive Corer (RoPeC) capable of autonomous sample acquisition and delivery from a depth of 5 cm. Specific attention will be given to the tall-pole items including the core break-off, retention, delivery, rotary-percussive drive, and gas flushing subsystems. Near term applications include the Astrobiology Field Laboratory and Mars Sample Return missions. Previous coring tool development has focused on integration and far-horizon proof of concepts; resulting in complete systems designed around specific requirements. The path forward lies in maturing specific aspects of designs quickly. The Phase 1 research has resulted in a survey of existing sampling systems as well as a conceptual design of the RoPeC with a focus on modularity. In Phase 2, Honeybee will mature the design of RoPeC subsystems; including the integration of a percussive voice coil actuator developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Powder Acquisition Drill System. A focus on modularity will ensure that subsystems can be redesigned independently; enabling the acquisition of core samples in targets including MEPAG suggested rocks, MSL Mars analogs and Phoenix analogs. This will lead to the a TRL of 5-6.* [Microplate Heat Exchanger, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3s2i-wrb4) - We propose a microplate heat exchanger for cryogenic cooling systems used for continuous flow distributed cooling systems, large focal plane arrays, multiple cooling locations, and very low vibration cooling systems. Any DC cryogenic flow system such as turbo Brayton, Joule-Thomson (JT), or remote cooling applications require very high effectiveness heat exchangers to reduce input power. The parasitic loads from heat exchangers are a significant fraction of the overall load, and high effectiveness heat exchangers lead directly to improved system efficiencies across a broad range of cryogenic applications.

Microplate heat exchangers have a demonstrated effectiveness over 98% (Marquardt, Cryocoolers 15). While performance is high, they will be difficult to use for larger cryogenic flow systems due to parasitic conduction losses inherent in the materials available for the manufacturing process. A material change will allow more compact heat exchangers with lower parasitic losses. Other limitations of the manufacturing process make yields low, and while it may be possible to push the effectiveness higher, it may be difficult to consistently produce high performing exchangers using the current approach.

We propose a new bi-metal microplate heat exchanger which is unique in that it uses the manufacturing process to control critical heat exchanger dimensions that are inherently similar across all parts, allowing high effectiveness without the need for close inspection of every part and the low yield which results from hand inspection. We further include additional features within the flow channels that automatically balance the mass flows within the heat exchanger to push the effectiveness even higher. This is accomplished in the most compact cryogenic heat exchangers theoretically possible to build using parallel plate flow channels.* [High Frequency Reflective Mesh for Small Aperture Antennas, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yswd-c9ht) - The proposed Phase II program would develop and prototype a high frequency, high performance reflective mesh that is well suited to the emerging small aperture antenna designs. The program will build on the testing knowledge of the Phase I prototyped mesh.  40 OPI gold mesh will be prototyped and integrated to a cubesat Ka-band reflector.  Carbon nanotube yarn will also be knitted into a 30 OPI mesh and tested on a similar antenna.  The Phase II program will move the mesh to TRL 6.  The goal is to make cost effective and robust mesh for the small aperture antenna community.  RF test samples and a complete deployable Ka-band antenna will be delivered to NASA JPL for RF testing.* [Green, Compact Hybrids for Nanosatellite Launchers, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q865-2xia) - Low cost access to space is essential for continued commercial exploitation of near-earth environments, and to support future science missions. A serious limitation on the cost of space access is the available propellants and propulsion system technologies for launch, orbital insertion, maneuvering and orbital reinsertion, and reaction and attitude control.This Phase I STTR program will validate ignition and performance parameters for a volumetrically-optimized, low cost, green, shippable hybrid propellant motor for low cost access to space.  The program is specifically targeted at validating performance via fabrication and delivery of replacements for the current Nihka and PSRM-120 stages (stage 2 and 3) based on the Black Brandt sounding rocket vehicle testbed under the Nanolaunch 1200 program guidelines.* [CER_BDS_TRMM-PFM_Edition1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bxin-j6v5) - CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data in HDF.* [LGM2605 as a mitigator of space radiation-induced vascular damage, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/92ne-bn7v) - LignaMed, LLC is a drug development company with a fast track strategy to approval of LGM2605, an oral small molecule for use as a radiation mitigating agent that reduces harmful effects of radiation exposure of normal tissues. LignaMed aims to evaluate LGM2605 as a mitigator of space-radiation induced vascular damage. NASA missions to Mars will expose astronauts to solar and galactic cosmic mixed radiation including low dose &#947; and proton radiation, but data is lacking on the biological and physiological effects in humans of this mixed source radiation. Research on space radiation effects on cellular systems, molecular targets and ultimately organ systems has identified potential harmful short and long-term effects on the health of astronauts. Work at the University of Pennsylvania identified damage to lungs years after a single exposure to low-dose gamma, 56Fe, 28Si and proton radiation exposure in mice. Acute and chronic radiation effects in organs are closely associated with vascular damage and dysfunction. Multiple studies have confirmed single source radiation side effects associated with significant loss of vascular integrity: increased vascular leakiness (edema), an activated inflammatory phenotype and extensive oxidative damage. However, damage to the vascular network under multiple radiation types simultaneously is not understood. LignaMed will employ gene knockout technology in vascular models exposed to space-relevant mixed radiation regimens to investigate the injury to the vasculature. We hypothesize that LGM2605 will mitigate space radiation-induced vascular damage by inhibiting early events that cause inflammation. This study will confirm that 1) space radiation drives endovascular damage via activation of the endothelial inflammatory phenotype resulting in increased permeability and 2) will validate LGM2605 as an effective mitigator of space radiation-induced vascular damage by inhibiting early events that drive long term adverse sequellae.* [Diagnosis-Driven Prognosis for Decision Making, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4jwb-x9pm) - In Phase II, the QSI-Vanderbilt team seeks to develop a system-level diagnostics and prognostic process that incorporates a "sense and respond capability," which first uses error codes and discrete sensor values to correctly diagnose the system health including degradations and failures of sensors and components, and then invokes appropriate prognostics routines for the assessment of RUL and performance capability. The QSI-Vanderbilt team plans to emphasize advancement in the following five areas: (a) leverage extensive LADEE telemetry data to further enhance and develop online degradation profiles, performance analysis and remaining useful life (RUL) computation algorithms, (b) develop/implement degradation detection algorithms to compute time-to-alarm (TTA) and time-to-maintenance (TTM) predictions and correlate with alarm/maintenance events, (c) develop reusable library of models and tests, (d) verification and validation of the resulting solution, and (e) demonstrate the proposed solution on LADEE's and other spacecraft subsystems. Once fully developed, outcomes of this effort will lower the cost of developing prognostics and provide maximum critical system availability, smarter scheduling of maintenance, overall logistics support cost, and optimal match of assets to missions. The proposed offering will also provide a cost-effective and pragmatic solution to our commercial customers who want to reduce unscheduled downtime by practicing condition based maintenance, but cannot justify the cost of developing prognostic methods in the conventional way.* [Cardiovascular Imaging and Strategies to Mitigate the Risk for Cardiac Events in Astronauts During Prolonged Spaceflight](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qia2-6ac8) - All aims have been accomplished. Because this section will be made publicly available, a modified selection from "main findings" is reproduced here.     
1). DEFINED HOW TO QUANTIFY PROGRESSION OF CAC: The most common clinical definition of >15% per year, which is used by NASA flight surgeons, is too sensitive to the baseline CAC and frequently gives erroneous information, especially in patients with low baseline levels of CAC (for example an increase of 1 to 2, 10 to 11, or 100 to 101 reflect a 100%, 10%, and 1% change, but would still reflect the same absolute change in CAC). Different methods can result in divergent classification in up to 30% of individuals. Although we could not define the "best" score, the Hokanson method, based on the square root of the change in CAC, seemed to be the most robust, and will be utilized in other publications. This paper has been accepted in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC): Imaging; Paixao ARM...Levine BD et al. Disagreement Between Different Definitions of Coronary Artery Calcium Progression. JACC: Imaging, 2014, in press.     
2). MADE THE NOVEL, CLINICALLY IMPORTANT OBSERVATION THAT THE FINAL CAC SCORE, RATHER THAN A MEASURE OF DISEASE PROGRESSION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION FOR PREDICTING CLINICAL EVENTS. So if serial CAC scanning is performed by flight surgeons, the latest scan should be used for risk assessment; knowledge of the change in CAC leading to this subsequent score will provide no independent prognostic information. This new finding obviates the need for complex calculations regarding rate of progression, and emphasizes that risk for future events depends mainly on the overall atherosclerotic burden, not on how fast the diseases progresses.

One critical innovation required is a pulse compression scheme at W-band (95 GHz) with ultra-low range sidelobe levels - on the order of 90 dB. The current space-borne cloud radar flying on CloudSat is an outstanding technical achievement but lacks sensitivity to weakly reflecting low altitude clouds. Because these clouds play a significant role in modulation the Earth's radiation budget follow-on missions will have to address this limitation. Pulse compression (coded) waveforms can maximize transmitter duty cycle usage and thus system sensitivity. However, the reflection from the Earth's surface can easily mask the cloud signal via the coded waveforms range sidelobe response. The requirement for detecting these clouds from space is severe and significant innovations are required to meet them. The proposed research addresses this requirement and is supported by staff who have significant experience in MMW system development, having built and flown the first airborne cloud radar utilizing FM chirp pulse compression.* [A Ground-Based Analog for CNS Exposure to Space Radiation: A System for Integrating Microbeam Technology and Neuronal Culture](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4h7j-xvwv) - Problem Statement: The connection between radiation-induced neuronal damage and deficits in behavior and cellular function is still largely unknown. Previous studies on the effects of space-like radiation have lacked the technology to selectively irradiate individual cells in culture, much less individual cellular structures. Thus there is currently no way to observe how individual neurons respond to radiation-induced damage of specific cellular structures, which is critical to building the mechanistic link between radiation damage and physiological changes. 

Overall Goal: This project aims to develop a system utilizing particle microbeam technology and neuronal cell culture that can serve as a ground-based analog to neuron exposure to space radiation. This neuron-microbeam system will be used to investigate the molecular and cellular effects of high-energy particle radiation on the central nervous system. 

Background: Space radiation poses one of the least understood and least mitigated risks to humans traveling outside the protection of Earth's magnetic field. Previous radiation biology research has primarily focused on DNA damage and the resulting carcinogenesis risk, and this work has been largely concerned with low linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation such as gamma rays and X-rays. However, space radiation includes a variety of high atomic number, high-energy (HZE) ions that transfer large amounts of energy when traversing biological materials. A Mars trip would expose astronauts to a total of about 0.2 Gy of HZE ions. This dose is relatively small for low LET radiation, but HZE ions with a high LET can inflict significant biological damage even at this low dose. The long-standing radiation biology theory that DNA is the primary radiosensitive target in cells may not hold true for the central nervous system (CNS) in the low-fluence, high-energy charged particle radiation environment of space. Because much of the CNS consists of volumes containing mostly cellular processes and relatively few cell bodies, it is plausible that in low dose and dose rate conditions, only a small fraction of cells traversed by a charged particle will suffer damage to the nucleus. Thus the observed radiation-induced deficits are likely caused by the traversal of a particle through some extra-nuclear component of the cell. 

Research Plan: The early stages of this project will focus on developing a cell culture method for neurons that fits the tight constraints of the microbeam system. The new culture method will be evaluated by its ability to replicate previously observed changes in dendritic spine morphology and concentrations of cytoskeletal proteins. The latter stages of this project will focus on integrating this cell culture method with the particle microbeam at Columbia University's Radiological Research Accelerator Facility. A custom imaging and targeting protocol will be developed using fluorescent reporters and the microbeam facility's targeting system to selectively irradiate subcellular structures of individual neurons in neuronal cultures. 

Aim 1: Development of a neuronal culture procedure compatible with the particle microbeam system
Aim 2: Integration of microbeam targeting system and neuronal culture. 
Aim 3: Validation of neuron-microbeam system via selective irradiation of neuronal dendrites 

Impact: This project aims to create the technological capacity to investigate cellular responses to specific, subcellular radiation targets for the purpose of building the mechanistic link between radiation damage and deficits in health and performance. Having this capability will help address the knowledge gaps related to acute central nervous system exposure to space radiation. This work can also be adapted to address the radiation exposure of other tissue types and has the potential to impact earth-side endeavors, namely the treatment of brain tumors with high-energy charged particle radiation.* [Effect of microgravity on brain gene expression in mice](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7bwh-kbdt) - Changes in gravitational force such as that experienced by astronauts during space flight induce a redistribution of fluids from the caudad to the cephalad portion of the body together with an elimination of normal head-to-foot hydrostatic pressure gradients. To assess brain gene profile changes associated with microgravity and fluid shift a large-scale analysis of mRNA expression levels was performed in the brains of 2 weeks control and hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice using cDNA microarrays. Although to different extent all functional categories displayed significantly regulated genes indicating that considerable transcriptomic alterations are induced by HU. Interestingly the TIC class (transport of small molecules and ions into the cells) had the highest percentage of up-regulated genes while the most down-regulated genes were those of the JAE class (Cell junction Adhesion Extracellular Matrix). TIC genes comprised 16% of those whose expression was altered including sodium channel nonvoltage-gated 1 beta (Scnn1b) glutamate receptor (Grin1) voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (Vdac1) calcium channel beta 3 subunit (Cacnb3) and others. The analysis performed by GeneMAPP revealed several altered protein classes and functional pathways such as blood coagulation and immune response learning and memory ion channels and cell junction. In particular data indicate that HU causes an alteration in hemostasis which resolves in a shift toward a more hyper-coagulative state with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Furthermore HU treatment seems to impact on key steps of synaptic plasticity and learning processes. We used brains of four control (C1 C2 C3 C4) and four tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (E1 E2 E3 E4) mice to ensure statistical relevance of the study. 60 ug of total RNA extracted in TRIzol from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences NJ). Differently labeled cDNAs obtained from a pair of biological replicas were co-hybridized overnight at 50C with a microscope slide spotted with ~ 27,000 mouse cDNA sequences produced by the Microarray Core Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the  xef xbf xbdmultiple yellow xef xbf xbd design (i.e.: C1C2 C3C4 E1E2 E3E4) described in Iacobas DA Fan C Iacobas S et al.

Original project aims/objectives: Back pain due to disk-herniation and space-adaptation is a serious concern for the health and wellbeing for astronauts. Current therapeutic drugs and devices to treat space travel related back pain are either systemically and/or cognitively dangerous for mission critical activities, ineffective, and/or non-renewable. The aims of this project were to evaluate long-duration ultrasound therapy as a therapeutic option to non-invasively and non-pharmaceutically effectively treat chronic low-back pain by reducing inflammation, muscle tightness, and modulating neuronal activation at the site of pain. Specifically, the project studied the use of a Food & Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared multi-hour prescription use sustained acoustic medicine device (sam Professional) as a solar-rechargeable therapeutic device to reduce pain, improve range of motion, and increase quality of life for patients with chronic low back pain. Additionally, the project included technology development of other ultrasonic frequencies and device form-factor that could prove useful in the space environment.    
2. Key findings: The sam Professional medical device was determined to reduce pain by approximately 2 points on the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale for patients with moderate to severe low back pain. In 65-subjects meeting study inclusion criteria, back pain was reduced by approximately 30% from baseline when the device was applied 5 times per week over 8 weeks of treatment. Patients in the study reported improved range of motion with less pain, and improved quality of life during daily activities. Analysis of the human subjects' data demonstrated statistically significant (p<0.01) pain reduction for chronic back pain. The multi-hour ultrasound technology was further developed into a coin-sized form factor capable of multi-hour ultrasound delivery, and electronics/transducers were designed and tested for 1 MHz ultrasonic capability. Both clinical and technological project aims and objectives where successfully accomplished.    
3. Impact of key findings on hypotheses, technology requirements, objectives and specific aims of the original proposal: The project found that multi-hour daily ultrasound therapy significantly reduced chronic back pain. This clinical study on 55-subjects provides additional clinical efficacy data on managing the symptoms of lower back pain with sam. When combined with other studies on the sam Professional device for back pain (approximately 120 patients in total) the therapeutic intervention is an available non-surgical/non-drug option for back pain patients. The technology is currently available on the US market for prescription use only. Additional electronic testing and validation of the devices would need to be conducted for space deployment.    
4. Proposed research plan for the coming year: The project was successfully completed and no additional work is scheduled. The project team anticipates preparation of the key findings for clinical dissemination of the outcome data.* [Fuzzy Spatiotemporal Data Mining to Activity Recognition in Smart Homes](https://data.nasa.gov/d/3ydc-zjjc) - A primary goal to design smart homes is to provide automatic assistance for the residents to make them able to live independently at home.  Activity recognition is done to achieve the mentioned goal and then to provide assistance, we would need three sort of information. First, we would need to know the goal of the resident, then the pattern that the resident should obey to achieve its goal and third sort of needed information is the deviations from the previously known patterns.  In the presented paper, spatiotemporal aspects of daily activities are surveyed to mine the patterns of activities realized by the smart homes residents.  Necessary data to model the spatiotemporal aspects of daily activities is provided by embedded sensors in the smart home. We believe that to accomplish daily activities, specific objects are applied and by analyzing the movement of objects and resident(s), we would obtain valuable information to model the daily activities of the Smart Home’s residents.* [Fused Reality for Enhanced Training and Flight Research](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q837-pb54) - <p>An updated, advanced head-mounted display is providing test pilots with unprecedented analysis and evaluation capabilities for aircraft and pilot performance, tasks that until now have been largely evaluated subjectively.

A mission utilizing stellar echo detectors could provide continent-level imaging of exoplanets more readily than interferometric techniques, as high temporal resolution detection is less technically challenging and more cost effective than multikilometer-baseline fringe-tracking, particularly in a photon-starved regime. The concept is also viable for survey missions for detecting exoplanets at more diverse orbital inclinations than is possible with transit or radial velocity techniques.

Under a Phase I NIAC program, we evaluated the feasibility of the stellar echo technique and, while several practical constraints have been identified, we have not identified any fundamental limitations. We determined that the foundational technology already exists and has high TRL in space missions. Furthermore, the measurements required to demonstrate the feasibility of stellar echo detection are complementary to asteroseismology measurements, so a demonstration mission would provide high-value scientific information to other active astrophysics programs.

Under the Phase II program, we will continue to advance the theoretical understanding of stellar echo imaging, improve on the computational methods developed in Phase I, evaluate specific hardware implementations, and ultimately produce a roadmap for the demonstration of stellar echo detection and imaging of exoplanets.* [Dual Use Packaging, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pj9x-unnv) - NASA seeks down-weighted packaging compatible with microwave preparation and perhaps high hydrostatic pressure processing.  New packaging must satisfy NASA's 3-year storage mandate.  Foil laminate containers meet NASA's oxygen, moisture and general shelf life demands; however, their weight, processing and disposal characteristic are not ideal.  A previous NASA SBIR examined nanobarrier-containing packages; but these did not perform to NASA's needs.  
	The current SBIR proposes to remove oxygen electrochemically, control moisture independent of the packaging, and also carefully selecting packaging materials to perform some second generation function.  Using non-packaging-related control of oxygen and moisture allows versatile selection of primary packaging to permit packaging concepts unacceptable under NASA's existing packaging paradigm.  These include edible packaging, soluble pre-weighed reconstitutable  cartridges for beverages, and packages designed for compatibility with mission-grown foods.  Primary food packs would be bundled in an overpack designed to remove oxygen and to manage moisture. The overpack would itself serve a secondary mission function.   Overpack materials might include photovoltaic polymer sheets, light emitting plastics, or might simply serve a a waste or food storage function.  Shifting oxygen and moisture control away from packaging allows package construction from much lighter material with reduced weight, processing and disposal limitations.  A dialog on extravehicular food storage is proposed* [TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Aerosol Index Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid V008](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kwkn-8ir7) - This data product contains TOMS/Nimbus-7 UV Aerosol Index Monthly L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format.

Composite structures for future applications are expected to be larger than 9 meters in diameter and greater than 10 meters in length. Such large composite structures cannot be fabricated by regular autoclaving processes because of limitations of the size of autoclaves and high costs associated with energy consumption. In this Phase I effort, MMI will develop a novel out-of-autoclave processing method for the fabrication of nanostructured polymer matrix composites for fabrication of light weight structural parts of large dimensions. This phase of research will also involve a system analysis of the technology to identify the benefits and target areas of use.  A correlation study based system analyses will provide a path to apply the fabrication methods to fabricate large composite parts used in aircraft structures.

It requires both the detection of a possible collision and deployment of an appropriate maneuver to avoid it, to be done in few seconds or less. NASA Langley and Boston University are engaged in a collaborative effort to design neuromorphic optic flow algorithms to avoid collisions and embed these algorithms in small, low-weight, and low-power customized hardware solutions in UAS.<p/><p>Using biologically-inspired neuromorphic optic flow algorithms is a novel approach in collision avoidance for UAS. Traditional computer vision algorithms rely on solving nonlinear partial differential equation systems to estimate optic flow which is a computationally expensive task. Neuromorphic algorithms instead make use of lessons learned in biology to solve these problems in a more efficient manner. An example is the fly's motion detector, which can be modeled by a system that uses a set of locally calculated, parallel spatio-temporal correlations for a set of velocities determined by the input sampling rates and flying speeds. Correlation results are interpreted as likelihood for a motion direction and speed. Stages of obstacle detection and tracking can temporally and spatially integrate these likelihoods to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and in turn the detection rate. In addition to its computational efficiency, the proposed neuromorphic solution is more stable and noise tolerant than solving a nonlinear optimization problem. Even if single computational nodes get corrupted due to functional or structural failures in the hardware, the performance of appropriately designed parallel, distributed neuromorphic algorithms degrades gracefully. Neuromorphic algorithms are commonly implemented using software running on general-purpose multicore/graphic processing unit systems. This approach, though flexible, can have significant overhead in terms of power, performance, and is not easily portable across platforms, therefore reducing its scope of applicability. In the second phase, we will port the neuromorphic algorithms to field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application specific integrated chips (ASICs). This will allow us to meet demanding performance requirements needed in UAS such as fast processing, low weight, low power consumption, as well as robustness to hardware failure.</p>* [SMEX03 Site Photographs, Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fm7u-pjcp) - The <em>SMEX03 Site Photographs</em> data set includes photographs of the regional study areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA as part of the 2003 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX03).* [SMEX03 QuikSCAT/SeaWinds Backscatter Data, Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/r35y-k4u9) - This data set includes data collected over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA, and Brazil.

The objective is to increase the shielding effectiveness against galactic cosmic radiation (GCR).&nbsp; Active shielding alone requires high power, and passive shielding alone requires high mass.&nbsp; The hybrid shield has the potential to address both these issues. &nbsp;</p> <p>The problem is that we have a vision of landing humans on Mars in the 2030s, but we do not yet know how to protect them from the space radiation.&nbsp; We are developing radiation shielding based on integrating active magnetic fields with passive shielding materials to increase the shielding effectiveness against galactic cosmic radiation (GCR).&nbsp; Active shielding alone requires high power, and passive shielding alone requires high mass.&nbsp; The hybrid shield has the potential to address both these issues of power and mass.&nbsp; The goal is to develop an optimized system of hybrid active-passive radiation shielding.&nbsp; Currently, there is no clear-cut solution to shielding humans from GCR during long duration space travel (more than 6 months from Earth to Mars, one way) and during planetary stays for exploration.&nbsp; Two different approaches exist:&nbsp; (1) choose the right passive materials combinations to slow down the GCR and the secondaries arising out of the interactions of the GCR with intervening matter; or (2) use active magnetic fields to deflect the GCR.&nbsp; These two approaches have limitations, necessitating a new approach like the proposed hybrid shielding.&nbsp; In the new hybrid shield approach, the GCR is bent by the magnetic field, and instead of traveling in a straight path it bends and takes a longer path, thus reducing the required mass of the passive shield component.&nbsp; The passive shielding materials reduce the speed of the incoming particles and thereby reduce the required magnetic field intensity and therefore reduce the power requirements of the active shield component.&nbsp; The combined effects of increased path length and reduced particle speed are two critical controlling factors for realizing improved shielding effectiveness.&nbsp; Preliminary results were obtained by using the Geant (Geometry and Tracking) 4 physics code in two-dimensional and three-dimensional radial simulations.&nbsp; The results show reduction in dose equivalent to human phantoms.&nbsp; Viable radiation shielding against GCR can be an enabler for human exploration of space.&nbsp; The success will have a huge impact on human exploration and operations missions in terms of the protection of humans for space exploration.&nbsp; It will be measured by the increased number of safe days in space.&nbsp; The systematic approach using the best and validated simulation tools to develop and down select viable concepts mitigates the risks of this approach.&nbsp; The effort aims to develop a series of simulations providing for analyses of shielding systems in sufficiently realistic detail to enable comprehensive understanding of the benefits provided and the relative merits of various optimizations.&nbsp; Given that the proposed simulation engine uses a Monte&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Carlo approach, it is generally best initially to go with the simplest configuration that meets requirements, so stable statistical results can be achieved more easily and with less computational time.&nbsp; In later steps of the optimization, it is necessary to invest the required time to ensure that the physical processes are accurately implemented, so all the important features are correctly modeled in order to get accurate and meaningful simulations.&nbsp; The potential payoff is high because the resulting hybrid active-passive shield concept could enable long duration space travel and space exploration for humans.&nbsp; This approach might also be useful for developing radiation protection for ion beam therapies on Earth. The progress will be measured by* [SMEX03 Landsat Thematic Mapper Imagery: Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uhn9-hpz7) - This data set provides imagery developed from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data for use in studying land cover features during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03).

To allow for rapid sample characterization on the Moon and Mars, the in situ non-destructive Raman detection technique is a highly desirable sensing tool for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. However, current Raman systems deployed in the field are inadequate due to deleterious fluorescence interference. Fluorescence is often several orders of magnitude more intense than Raman scattering signals and its broad structures spectrum could be difficult to remove from Raman spectra. We propose to develop a new infrared fiber-optic Raman sensor that can eliminate fluorescence with significantly improved Raman sensitivity for fast field detections.  The proposed concept is based on recent technology advances in fiber lasers, fiber optic Raman probes and infrared detector arrays.  Innovative infrared fiber-optic Raman sensor enables highly sensitive fluorescence-free Raman analysis and offers flexible remote detection, so that the field spectrometer's overall performance would be intact and extremely flexible for planetary missions. No dispersive Raman system today offers the unique fluorescence elimination for rapid in-situ fiber-optic remote detection.* [Integrated Data Assimilation Architecture, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/b5xg-z26c) - The Integrated Data Assimilation Architecture (IDAA) is a middleware architecture that facilitates the incorporation of heterogeneous sensing and control devices into a unifying system with standardized application interfaces.  The architecture is standards-based (IEEE wireless standards) and is an open architecture that can be easily extended.  This system is innovative from several perspectives: (1) the design explicitly supports multiple disparate devices ? to date, wireless middlewares have focused on single device types or single network types; (2) independent development is explicitly supported by means of a published application programmer interface (API) along with system client libraries that provide standard services; and (3) a Development Kit ("DevKit") that includes working examples and source code templates is provided to assist developers in the integration of a new monitoring device and/or the composition of a new application that is a consumer of the data produced by the system.  The proposed system will support the T3.01 Aerospace Communications topic by delivering a hybrid architecture that by design can incorporate multiple heterogeneous wireless devices and networks. Additionally, the IDAA system provides for multi-developer system extensibility, alleviating the problem of a monopolistic single-vendor implementation, where only the original developer of the middleware can efficiently extend the system functionality.* [LBA-ECO LC-23 Characterization of Vegetation Fire Dynamics for Brazil: 2001-2003](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7ciq-6dmh) - Satellite fire detection was determined from two sensors, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA-12 and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on both the Terra and Aqua platforms, for 2001- 2003 to characterize fire activity in Brazil, giving special emphasis to the Amazon region. Active fire data for AVHRR/NOAA-12 was produced using a fixed threshold fire detection technique based on the algorithm developed by the Centro de Previsao do Tempo e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC/INPE) (Setzer and Pereira, 1991; Setzer et al., 1994; Setzer and Malingreau, 1996). Active fire data for MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua was produced using a contextual fire detection technique based on NASA-University of Maryland algorithm (Justice et al., 2003; Giglio et al.2003).Resulting fire counts were compared for major biomes of Brazil (Figure 1), the nine states of the Legal Amazon (e.g., Tocantins, Figure 2), and two important road corridors in the Amazon region (Figure 3). In evaluating the daily fire counts, there is a dependence on variations in satellite viewing geometry, overpass time, atmospheric conditions, and fire characteristics (Schroeder et al., 2005). The data provided are the coordinates of daily active vegetation fires in Brazil for 2001 through 2003 at 1km resolution for both AVHRR and MODIS sensors.  Data are provided in both Arcview (shape file format) and ASCII comma separated file formats. Vector files for the major biomes of Brazil, the nine states of the Legal Amazon, and two important road corridors in the Amazon region are also included.* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI Biophysical Parameter Fields, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/62gr-szyg) - ABSTRACT: The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data set and derived biophysical parameter fields were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. This multiple resolution (1/4, 1/2 and 1 degree in latitude and longitude) biophysical parameter data set contains essential variables for the calculation of photosynthesis, and the energy and water exchange between the Earth's surface (in particular of vegetation) and the lower boundary layer of the atmosphere. The Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) is related to the light absorption and the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation. It also serves as an intermediate variable to calculate vegetation cover fraction (Vcover), total Leaf Area Index (LAI_T), green leaf area index (LAI_G), roughness length (z0), zero plane displacement (d), and snow-free albedo. The biophysical parameters were derived assuming one canopy layer. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Ionosphere Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC) Rapid Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/d7du-3ifp) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Rapid Ionosphere Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC) product (daily files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). The VTEC product files also include Delay Code Bias (DCB) values for GNSS satellites and ground receivers derived during the analysis. GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe’s Galileo, China’s Beidou, Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure. GNSS observations from a global network can be utilized for atmospheric measurements. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International GNSS Service (IGS) retrieve GNSS data on regular schedules to produce independently computed VTEC maps. The IGS Ionosphere Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS VTEC maps. The rapid VTEC maps are computed with a resolution of 2 hours in UT, 5 degrees in longitude and 2.5 degrees in latitude; they have an availability with a latency of 1-2 days.* [Ocean Life Detection on Alien Worlds, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bx98-hakc) - This proposal is in response to NASA's request for technologies that can enhance the detection of life in alien oceans. As stated in the call, the Technologies for Detection of Extant Life subtopic seeks instruments and component technologies that will enable unambiguous determination of whether extant life is present in target environments on other solar system bodies. Because there is no single measurable signature of life, this will require advances in a variety of areas, from those involving sample processing to the detailed components of chemical and optical instruments. Searches for extant life can take place in a variety of environments, including ocean depths, ice sheets, dry deserts, seasonal flows, or even dense atmospheres; technologies are required for handling samples obtained from any or all of these environments. Preprocessing technologies required for those samples may include separation, concentration, dilution, drying, staining, mixing, and many other common processes for laboratory analysis, but which must be done in a remote, autonomous environment. Tests of whether a given sample contains or indicates the presence of extant life include the full range of microbiological and chemical techniques, but those that do not require the addition of potential biomarkers (e.g., complex organics) as part of the test are preferred. We have spent he past 5 years developing a novel means of capturing and concentrating organic molecules onto specialized graphene surfaces, available for later detailed analysis. The adaptation of this technology could offer a new avenue for the detection of key organic elements in ocean environments that contain many background elemental noise sources.* [Fusion of THEMIS and TES for Accurate Mars Surface Characterization, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s6is-zhbe) - In a recent NASA ROSES solicitation, NASA has expressed strong interest in improving surface characterization of Mars using orbital imagers. Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) and Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) are orbital multispectral imagers of Mars. THEMIS has 10 spectral bands in the 6-13 micrometers region and a spatial resolution of 100 m. TES has 143 spectral bands in the 5-50 micrometers range, but with low spatial resolution of 3x3 km. Although both have been used to map out the surface composition of Mars, there are some limitations. First, THEMIS has low spectral resolution that may not provide accurate surface characterization. Second, TES has low spatial resolution that cannot provide fine spatial details of surface characteristics. Roughly speaking, each TES pixel contains about 900 THEMIS pixels. It is therefore very challenging to fuse the two data sets. 

We propose a novel and accurate framework that can deal with the above challenge. The framework is based on the latest development in image registration, image fusion, anomaly detection, pixel classification using hyperspectral images, and concentration estimation. First, a two-step image registration algorithm is proposed to align the THEMIS and TES bands. Subpixel accuracy can be achieved. Second, a novel image fusion algorithm is proposed to fuse THEMIS and TES bands to generate an image cube with 143 bands of 100-m resolution images. Our algorithm has been proven to be better than state-of-the-art fusion algorithms. Third, we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm for detecting interesting regions in the fused image cube. This algorithm is known as cluster kernel Reed Xiaoli (CKRX) and has high performance in anomaly detection. Fourth, a sparsity based approach is proposed to perform accurate rock classification. Finally, a deep learning based algorithm is proposed to estimate the chemical composition of the rocks for better surface characterization.* [Goddard radio-frequency explorer Radio frequency Interference real time Display system](https://data.nasa.gov/d/be4k-nvse) - <p>RFI is an increasingly important factor in the quality performance of radiometer instruments while the quantity of usable microwave measurements is decreasing due to the presence of RFI. Because of the widespread use of wireless communications such as cellphone and satellite TV, the frequencies reserved for the science community are seeing more and more contamination.&nbsp;In particular, no scientific data can be retrieved for the heavily RFI contaminated region. This problem led to the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission implementation of an RFI detection capability on its radiometer digital backend. However, this instrument is limited by the sampling speed and processing resources available. In particular, the digital backend frequency bandwidth is limited to 24MHz. This shows that the spaceflight technology for RFI detection is limited any the higher frequencies for K, Ka band or beyond.</p><p><strong>This effort proposes a game-changing, higher frequency RFI detection and mitigation digital backend for microwave radiometers.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Prototyping a high frequency RFI detection instrument </strong>by combining the GREX system with a new RFI detection algorithm based on information theory and complex-valued signal processing.</p>* [Microgravity Multi-Phase Flow Experiment for Suborbital Testing (MFEST)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s55r-7nx3) - <p>The primary objective is to conduct a pathfinder, suborbital flight experiment for two-phase fluid flow and separator operations.The primary purpose of this test program is to verify functional operations of a multi-phase flow system and unique separator for a relatively long duration suborbital flight, in support of future space vehicle designs and missions. Two-phase flow experimental studies at reduced gravities have been very limited, and primarily conducted using special aircraft modified to fly parabolas. This first suborbital flight would allow longer-duration, continuous operational testing with variable gravity over a wider range, for both the unique separator and two-phase flow design.    <p/><p>The NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), Crew and Thermal Systems Division (CTSD), had previously developed an orbital flight experiment to 1) test the feasibility of a water purifier for use in zero-gravity conditions, and 2) demonstrate sustained operation of a two-phase flow system with a passive gas/liquid separator. By design, the influent fluid was kept under pressure to saturate the water with gas; however, farther downstream, the fluid mixture is returned to near atmospheric pressure and fed into a vortex separator. The separator and overall system function was designed for operation in both Earth-gravity and zero-gravity conditions. The gas within the system is vented off downstream of the separator, and most of the liquid is re-circulated in the processing loop over the duration of operations. MFEST proposes to modify the experiment to test the two-phase flow and separation functions without using simulated or active water processing. This creates the following benefits/features: this project  will test a two-phase flow system and vortex separator concept that continues to be considered for space applications, under the challenging environment conditions of launch, zero-g, and entry, and with sustained operations;  two-phase flow and separator systems are needed in numerous technical areas (e.g., life support, thermal, science) and have been identified as a critical technology; no long-duration testing for variable gravity has been accomplished for this separator concept/design, and it leverages outdated experiment/hardware (has been on the shelf for a decade) for future spaceflight missions. Multi-phase flow systems can be applicable to technologies designated in multiple draft Office of Chief Technologist (OCT) Space Technology Roadmaps: Technical Area TA02, In-Space Propulsion Technologies; TA03, Space Power and Energy Storage; TA06, Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems; TA07, Human Exploration Destination Systems; and TA14, Thermal Management Systems. The experiment was originally designed for the Space Shuttle mid-deck, but was never flown due to mass, crew time, and other mission limitations. For the suborbital flight opportunity, the primary purpose of the test program would be to verify functional operations of the flow system and unique separator for a relatively long duration with variable gravity, in support of future space vehicle designs and missions.</p>* [Evacuated Airship for Mars Missions](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n6f9-wbqa) - We propose to overcome some of the limitations of current technologies for Mars exploration and even extend current operational capabilities by introducing the concept of a vacuum airship. This concept is similar to a standard balloon, whereas a balloon uses helium or hydrogen to displace air and provide lift, a vacuum airship uses a rigid structure to maintain a vacuum to displace air and provide lift.

A vacuum airship made of a homogenous material cannot withstand the atmospheric pressure on Earth for any material humans have yet discovered, which can be proven using the critical buckling load of a sphere. However, from an initial analysis of the vacuum airship structure and relationship to atmospheric conditions, Mars appears to have an atmosphere in which the operation of a vacuum airship would not only be possible, but beneficial over a conventional balloon or dirigible. In addition, a multi-layer approach, in conjunction with a lattice, would circumvent the buckling problems of a single homogenous shell. The lattice used to support the two layers of the vacuum airship shell can be made, using modulation of the lengths of the members, to fit the curvature of the vacuum airship precisely by following an atlas approach to the modulation. The Martian atmosphere has a pressure to density ratio that is very beneficial to the operation of a vacuum airship; this is a result of the high average molecular weight of the atmosphere (relative to other planets in the solar system) and the temperature of the atmosphere, the trend for which can be observed from the ideal gas law. Through a more in-depth analysis of the vacuum airship model, it can be shown that the vacuum airship may theoretically carry more than twice as much payload as a modeled dirigible of the same size, a 40-meter radius, in the Martian atmosphere.

A vacuum airship would be a valuable design for a vehicular probe for Mars. There are far fewer obstacles for an aerial vehicle as compared to a land vehicle such as existing Mars rovers, e.g. one need not worry about the vacuum airship getting stuck in a trench or being unable to traverse terrain. The vacuum airship could be used as a communication relay for other vehicular probes on Mars thereby overcoming line of sight constraints. If the vacuum airship is damaged, it can land, be repaired, and re-evacuated to resume operation, whereas a balloon would need to have gas pumped back into the vessel. Since the vacuum airship does not use a lifting gas, it can perform a near infinite number of compensation maneuvers to adjust or stabilize its altitude in a temperature variant environment. The vacuum airship could use its structure to protect the instruments from solar radiation and high energy particles. The vacuum airship probe would be able to traverse a much greater area of the planet in a smaller amount of time because there is no need to worry about getting stuck, and the vacuum airship can also observe a greater swath of land by rising in elevation. Even though the vacuum airship would be aerially base, the vehicle would still be able to touch down and perform tasks on the ground; it is even possible the vacuum airship could be used to transport ground probes to different locations. As far as energy is concerned, the large surface area of the vacuum airship would provide plenty of area for solar cells which would allow the vehicle to gather a large amount of solar energy without any additional structure, and once the airship is evacuated, the only energy it requires is for propulsion which can be accomplished by electric motors, unlike helicopters and airplanes which require energy to be devoted to lift.* [Open|SpeedShop Ease of Use Performance Analysis for Heterogenious Processor Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y39y-bzeg) - We propose building upon the modular extensible architecture and existing capabilities of Open|SpeedShop to provide seamless, integrated, heterogeneous processor performance analysis. The NVIDIA GPU and Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) processors are increasingly important at high performance computing (HPC) laboratories within NASA for use on NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects because of their ability to accelerate scientific application performance.  In order to understand what impact these accelerators are having on performance, tools must succinctly present heterogeneous processor performance information.

One of the key goals of this work is to develop innovative methods for presenting the performance information extracted from applications running on both traditional CPU and GPU/MIC processors. And, specifically, to provide command line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI) displays of the heterogeneous processor performance information that facilitates the user's understanding of how their application utilizes the accelerator.

For this project, Phase I GPU-related research will include measuring the usefulness of a GPU kernel, including device utilization, data transfer rates, device efficiency metric, internal device tiling factors, device memory hierarchy usage, as well as additional factors outlined in the referenced material. When measuring the performance of an application that contains concurrent processing on both the CPU and GPU processors, attributing time spent to the proper processor can be difficult - a difficulty exacerbated by the potential presence and usage of multiple accelerators concurrently. Accurately measuring the interactions of multiple accelerator devices is necessary in order to accurately report the application's performance to the user, but is difficult with the current set of accelerator interfaces. Developing techniques for mitigating these limitations will be another area of our GPU research.* [SRI CubeSat Imaging Radar for Earth Science: Instrument Development and Demonstration (CIRES-IDD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/r87t-meuj) - Space-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a key change-detection tool in NASA’s Earth Science Division portfolio. InSAR addresses three of the seven major themes summarized by the National Research Council Earth Sciences Decadal Survey: 1) solid-earth hazards and dynamics; 2) human health and security; and 3) land-use change, ecosystem dynamics, and biodiversity. All require global, frequent assessments of solid surface deformation via InSAR measurements.

For maximum impact, InSAR measurements must be precise (sub-cm level) and timely. Frequent acquisitions (sub-weekly) are needed to provide enhanced deformation precision through time series averaging, and ensure that an event is properly captured and characterized. Orbital mechanics prevent single-platform sensors from simultaneously achieving rapid revisit times and wide-area coverage. Multiple platforms are needed to avoid compromising coverage, but traditional InSAR sensors are too expensive (> $300M) to replicate.

Under the NASA ESTO IIP program, SRI International (SRI) and our team of collaborators propose to develop a complete SAR/InSAR instrument for CubeSats. The instrument is called CIRES-IDD (CubeSat Imaging Radar for Earth Science – Instrument Development and Demonstration). We will leverage SRI’s TRL-5 CIRES radar hardware developed under NASA ACT funding, SRI’s TRL 4 image formation software, and a TRL-3 high-gain deployable membrane antenna to form the complete instrument.

CIRES-IDD is a three-year program with ground and airborne unmanned aerial systems (UAS) demonstrations to retire technology risks and raise the CIRES-IDD system TRL from 3 to 6 in preparation for a future orbital demonstration campaign. The planned IIP period of performance is from 9 January 2017 to 8 January 2020. The following points summarize the maturation plan for each technology piece.

We will start by maturing the SAR/InSAR image-processing solution. SRI will apply their extensive set of SAR algorithms and coherent registration techniques to CIRES-IDD. We will test and debug the developed software on the UAS platform, followed by a rigorous calibration campaign. SRI experience with adapting the image formation tools to different systems (e.g., operational TRL-9 airborne radar systems) enables a relatively straightforward algorithm development path based on previously proven techniques.

Our antenna partner, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI), will develop the high-gain deployable membrane antenna (>36 dBi). PSI will iteratively develop and test increasing scales of antenna test articles, focusing on deployment, tensioning, packaging efficiency, and RF performance. Antenna risk reduction tests will include microgravity deployment and folding tests, among others.

Working with NASA Ames Research Center and the NASA Airborne Science Program, we will execute four UAS flight campaigns to validate CIRES-IDD utility at altitude. These flights will demonstrate the full SAR/InSAR performance capabilities (25-m imaging resolution, sub-cm-level InSAR accuracy, SNR >13 dB) and demonstrate scientific relevance. We have partnered with Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Stanford University, and the U.S. Geological Survey to identify local areas of interest and assist with analyzing and assessing the utility of the data for scientific research.

The lessons learned from UAS testing will be used to optimize the CIRES-IDD design features such as thermal resilience, power management, mass, volume, and sensor capabilities, thereby improving system performance and reducing risks for future on-orbit operations. Although the proposed project’s ultimate goal is to prepare and prove CIRES-IDD for future on-orbit CubeSat operations, the UAS SAR system resulting from this effort will become a useful scientific research platform in its own right, a capability also valued in the Decadal Survey.* [Development of Digital Micromirror Devices for Far-UV Applications](https://data.nasa.gov/d/shu3-ud6p) - We propose to develop commercially available digital micromirror devices (DMDs) for use in the far ultraviolet (FUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV) regimes of 100 nm – 400 nm, using recently developed FUV mirror coatings. DMDs can be used as rapidly reconfigurable “slit mask” object-selectors in space-based UV multi object spectrometers (MOS). Currently, DMDs are the only alternative to microshutter arrays, which were developed for the infrared MOS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The need for an efficient UV MOS has been identified as a Priority 1 Technological Gap by the general community, according to the Cosmic Origins 2016 Program Annual Technology Report. There are several missions currently in the planning process, which are developing concepts for multi-object spectrometers. For example both LUVOIR and HabEx plan to include such an instrument, working into the UV. Several smaller dedicated spectroscopic survey missions based around a highly multiplexed spectrometer have also been proposed. The choice of slit selector for such instruments is limited. While microshutter arrays are currently viewed as the frontrunner, the previous generation of microshutters has limitations and the next generation is still in early development. We have worked extensively on space qualification of the Texas Instruments DMDs and have shown the current generation of these devices to be ideal for space applications. However the deep UV (100 nm -300 nm) reflectivity of such devices needs to be substantially higher. We will re-coat commercially available DMDs (which use aluminum alloy mirrors) with high reflectivity aluminum, which is protected by an overcoat using recently developed FUV-enhanced thin films (LiF and AlF3). These protected aluminum coatings were developed to have a high reflectivity in the FUV range of 100 nm – 300 nm by two recent SAT projects. This work will build on our own previous SAT-funded efforts to determine the usability of DMDs in space and to extend their use into the NUV range of 200 nm – 400 nm. As part of this work we will produce re-coated DMDs with a high reflectivity in the FUV (with and without a protective window) and investigate the susceptibility of these devices to damage due to long exposures to highly energetic FUV photons. DMDs that operate in the FUV range will provide an alternative to microshutter arrays and help close a critical technology gap in FUV/NUV astronomy.* [Standoff Ultra-Compact Raman (SUCR) system Development for faster daytime mineralogy and Raman Imaging](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yiqk-29t9) - Raman spectroscopy can positively identify organic molecules, biomarkers, biominerals, water, water containing minerals, and minerals that are of high interest to NASA and directly serve the goal of finding evidence for past life on Mars and other planets. Micro-Raman systems are capable of performing fine-scale mineralogy; hence, they are being actively proposed as instruments on planetary rovers for in situ analysis. A micro-Raman system, Raman Laser Spectrometer (RLS), developed by Centro de Astrobiología, Unidad Asociada (CSIC-UVA), Spain is one of the Pasteur Payload instruments on board the ESA ExoMars rover to be launched in 2018. Similarly, JPL and Washington University in St. Louis, have developed a micro-Raman system, Mars Microbeam Raman Spectrometer (MMRS) with funding from NASA.
The RLS and MMRS are severely limited in their performance because (1) they require sample collection, (2) cannot be operated under daytime conditions, (3) provide poor Raman capabilities in presence of fluorescence, (4) cannot separate the highly desirable bio-florescence signal from unwanted mineral fluorescence signal, and (5) are too slow (1 to 60 s/spectrum). No Raman images will be expected from these systems due to these limitations. These disadvantages are due to the implementation of traditional Raman technology that is designed for dark laboratory use. These limitations will significantly lower the science return from these micro-Raman systems in terms of number and variety of samples that can be analyzed on Mars. 
Under this proposal, we propose to develop a new “Standoff Ultra-Compact Raman” (SUCR) instrument in collaboration with University of Hawaii which will solve all of the limitations listed above with the RLS and MMRS instruments. SUCR provides a superior micro-Raman instrument for future NASA missions. The development of SUCR will require improvements in both remote Raman and ultra-compact Raman technologies and the implementation of line imaging for faster Raman context imaging and map collection. The SUCR system will be able to quickly collect (1 s/spectrum) high quality in situ Raman spectral images in the daytime, from distances of several centimeters, with no need for samples collection. For example, the SUCR instrument will allow for fine scale context mineralogy of drilled cores, layer structures, and trenches. In addition, SUCR will be able to detect any micron size biomarker in situ with its faster search and scan mode (0.1s). Under this project, the TRL of the proposed SUCR instrument will advance from TRL 1 to TRL 3.* [Simplified, Parallelized InSAR Scientific Computing Environment](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kxnc-zwrp) - There is a vast amount of SAR data that is challenging for scientists to use. We propose a variety of technologies in SAR processing that will accelerate the processing and the use of the science products. Specifically, we will:
1) Develop methods of computational acceleration by exploiting back projection methods on cloud-enabled GPU platforms to directly compute focused imagery in UTM (landsat grid). This will deliver SAR data to users as user-ready products, in a form that is most familiar to them from optical sensors and which has never been done before. It has been a major obstacle for scientists to adopt radar data. Once formed, the data can be accessed on standard GIS platforms. We could greatly reduce the processing complexity for users so they can concentrate on the science, and bring the products seamlessly into the 21st century tools that are rapidly evolving to handle the developing data explosion;
2) Develop python-based framework technologies at the user interface that support a more natural way for scientists to specify products and actions, thereby accelerating their ability to generate science results
3) Extend the ESTO-funded InSAR Scientific Computing Environment framework to uniformly treat polarimetric and interferometric time-series such as those that will be created by the NISAR mission using serialized product-based workflow techniques.
There are several key challenges that need to be addressed in parallel: 1) speed and efficiency in handling very large multi-terabyte time-series imagery data files. This requires innovations in multi-scale (GPU, node, cluster, cloud) workflow control; 2) framework technologies that can support the varied algorithms that these data can support, from SAR focusing, interferometry, polarimetry, interferometric polarimetry, and time-series processing; framework technologies that can support heterogeneous, multi-sensor data types (point-clouds and raster) in time and space.
NASA’s upcoming radar mission, NISAR, will benefit from this technology after its planned launch in 2021, but first the vast archive of all international missions such as the Sentinel-1 A/B data at the Alaska Satellite Facility can be exploited more fully.* [LIGHT-WEIGHT, NON-CONTACT MAGNETIC TRANSMISSION FOR UAV AND ROTORCRAFT APPLICATIONS, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/efhv-imr5) - Speed reducing units consisting of mechanical gears are widely used in applications to match high speed prime movers to low speed loads.  All aerospace applications of gearboxes require lubrication, maintenance, and overhaul; and are subject to eventually wearing out due to tooth surface wear and gear tooth fatigue.  In many cases the requirements for gearbox lubrication, maintenance/overhaul and service life limits are acceptable; but in some extreme applications these requirements become a severe performance limitation.  For example, high altitude long endurance missions (HALE) typically operate at an altitude greater than 60,000 feet and stay in flight for durations longer than 24 hours.  HALE vehicles need a lightweight, highly efficient solution to operate slow moving propellers maintenance free for an extended period of time in an extreme environment.  We are proposing to develop a magnetic gearbox technology that can meet the needs of these extreme applications.    A magnetic gearbox has many advantages over a traditional mechanical gearbox. The different rotating components in the magnetic gearbox will never touch so the only lubrication required is in the bearing systems.  The magnetic gearbox will be essentially maintenance-free except for periodic bearing lubrication/inspection.  Vibrations that do not exceed the pull-out torque of the magnetic teeth do not add measurably to the mechanical stresses in the magnetic gearbox so fatigue issues will be minimal.  If the pull-out (maximum) torque is exceeded the magnetic gearbox will simply skip a tooth and re-engage when the overload situation is resolved.   In the present research we have demonstrated an experimental magnetic gearbox that achieves much higher specific torque than any previously demonstrated design.* [CERES Bidirectional Scans TRMM Edition1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i37v-vgrq) - CER_BDS_TRMM-PFM_Edition1 data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.Each Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data product contains twenty-four hours of Level-1b data for each CERES scanner instrument mounted on each spacecraft.

Often performance drives engineering designs, but for NASA, there is an inherent tradeoff between performance and weight. As would be expected, weight and size limitations impact system functionality and performance. Also, in many recent NASA missions, there is a need for communication system reconfiguration after launch.

These limitations have prompted a desire for multibeam and wideband antennas that can realize reconfigurable functionality. Reflector and lens antennas are typically used for satellites. However, phased arrays offer many advantages over reflectors and lenses. They provide higher aperture efficiency and power amplification at the element level. Also, they have no spillover loss, no aperture blockage, and better reliability. However, they have not been adapted as much due to their limited bandwidth and technology costs for reconfiguration.

Recent developments in wave slow down techniques using metamaterials have now allowed for very thin conformal antenna apertures that are concurrently broadband (as much as 10:1). This overcomes the ensuing conundrum of narrowband printed antenna technologies. Also, low cost multibeam approaches and software reconfigurable feeds are now possible to enable low cost conformal Ka band arrays. 

Here, I am proposing a novel wideband metamaterial technology that relies on our group's experience and recent developments on wideband small arrays and multibeam technologies. The proposed metamaterial array technology is based on the novel concept of emulating in-plane anisotropy to introduce many more design degrees of freedom to achieve significant wave slow down and wide bandwidth. As part of this fellowship, I will adapt these new metamaterial concepts to develop wideband (>4:1 bandwidth) Ka-band arrays. The array will also include low cost software-defined RF electronics for beam synthesis and reconfiguration.* [SiC Matrix Composites for High Temperature Hypersonic Vehicle Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rj5v-dk7c) - Durable high temperature materials are required for reusable hypersonic structural thermal protection systems. In particular, temperatures exceeding 2700ºF, and approaching 3000ºF, are targeted for capable structural materials that can survive stresses on the order of 10 ksi (70 MPa) for at least 100 hours in an oxidizing environment.  Such materials have been identified as an enabling material for future hypersonic vehicles  As this application is structural, a strong degree of damage tolerance is desired, and thus ceramic matrix composites
are the primary choice due to the desire for reduced weight, high temperature strength and oxidation resistance. Silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix (SiC/SiC) composites are believed to be the most suitable solution due to meeting the requirements
with the limitations of creep at the highest temperatures/loads, and oxidative attack at stresses that exceed the materials proportional limit. The proposed effort will define the temperature-stress limit of SiC/SiC composites, and examine methods to further extend this limit.* [GPM SAPHIR on MT1 (PRPS) Radiometer Precipitation Profiling L3 1 month 0.25 x 0.25 degree V05 (GPM_3PRPSMT1SAPHIR) at GES DISC](https://data.nasa.gov/d/am7s-2p59) - The Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate
of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence
of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation
retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals
from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial
coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument
are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.

Fundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the
retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and
index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information,
unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is
advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model
data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).

The algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution
(regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation
estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database
provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.* [Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Final Cumulative Station Positions/Velocities (no covariance matrix) Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cngb-z2u7) - This derived product set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System Final Cumulative Station Positions/Velocities (no covariance matrix) Product available from the Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS).

Astronauts experience gravitational transitions from Earth's gravitational level during launch to microgravity in space, then to partial gravity if landing on the Moon, Mars, or Martian moons, followed by a return to microgravity, and finally re-entry back to Earth. In addition, the use of Artificial Gravity (AG) from an on-board centrifuge also presents an altered gravity challenge, in particular during transitions between gravity levels. During each of these g-transitions astronauts must adapt their sensorimotor programs to coordinate perceptual and motor capabilities and function successfully and safely. The ability to identify and predict changes in sensorimotor function during these g-transitions is essential to the development of protocols and countermeasure implementation for future crew members. This project takes a new approach which could lead to a practical and acceptable protocol. We alter gravito-inertial accelerations with centrifugation in different body orientations. Furthermore, we have quantified sensory adaptation capabilities of both perception and manual control ability to a transition into hypo-gravity. Additionally, we investigated the effect of a common motion sickness drug, promethazine, on basic vestibular motion perception. This is an important step in better understanding the benefits and risks associated with the use of motion sickness drugs in conjunction with adaptation training and in flight after critical gravity transitions.     <p></p>
Specific Aims: The original specific aims for this project were: SA1) Demonstrate that individual differences exist in the ability to adapt to gravitational transitions, and can be measured quantitatively by measures of subjective orientation, closed loop manual control, and subjective motions sickness reports. SA2) Test whether pre-training by adapting to one altered gravity environment can improve sensorimotor adaptation in another altered gravity environment. SA3) Test whether the leading pharmacological agent, promethazine, affects either basic vestibular perceptual function or the adaptation rate to an altered gravity environment and the associated motion sickness symptoms. SA4) Develop and test a combined pre-adaptation training and pharmacological intervention protocol that can both improve sensorimotor adaptation and reduce the associated motion sickness.     <p></p>
Hypotheses: The hypotheses are: H1) Individual differences exist in the ability to adapt to altered gravity environments and these differences can be predicted by measuring adaptability in one altered gravity environment. H2) Pre-adaptation training in one altered gravity environment will improve sensorimotor adaptation in another altered gravity environment. H3) Promethazine will reduce motion sickness, but will have no influence on either basic vestibular perceptual function or sensorimotor adaptation to altered gravity environments.     <p></p>
Results: We determine individual differences in performance of both the perception and manual control tasks in terms of initial performance decrement and adaptation time constant. All subjects consistently show a performance decrement in the perception and closed-loop manual control task on initial exposure to altered-gravity, followed by a return back to baseline performance. Promethazine significantly affects upright roll tilt motion perception thresholds, a measure of basic vestibular perceptual function. Thresholds were not different with promethazine for upright yaw or upright interaural translation motions. However, the small but consistent effect of promethazine on roll tilt perception could have functional and operational significance.     <p></p>
Deliverables: Deliverables are a methodology for measuring an individual's capacity to adapt to an altered gravity environment using affordabl* [Pre-flight Training of Autonomic Responses for Mitigating the Effects of Spatial Disorientation During Spaceflight](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gzts-gszf) - Space motion sickness is characterized by symptoms of spatial disorientation, nausea, and vomiting. It affects approximately 70% of the crew during space travel and symptoms are commonly treated with intramuscular injections of promethazine. However, this countermeasure has had limited effectiveness and produces unwanted side-effects that include drowsiness and impaired performance. This study addresses PRD Risks: Risk of Therapeutic Failure due to Ineffectiveness of Medication; Risk of Impaired Control of Spacecraft, Associated Systems and Immediate Vehicle Egress due to Vestibular/Sensorimotor Alterations Associated with Spaceflight. Integrated Research Plan (IRP) Gap SM11: Can crewmember spatiomotor abilities be more accurately predicted and countermeasures and training techniques developed to mitigate spatial disorientation during spaceflight? The purpose of the proposed research is to evaluate an alternative countermeasure for mitigating symptoms without the side effects commonly observed with anti-motion sickness medications. Autogenic-Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE) is a 6-hour physiological training program that has proven to be a highly efficient and effective method for enabling people to monitor and voluntarily control up to 20 of their own physiological responses, thereby suppressing motion sickness symptoms. In an earlier flight study, three astronauts were given AFTE during preflight training and three other astronauts participated as controls and were given a pharmacologic treatment. Shuttle crews were required to record data during launch, waking hours on mission days 1 to 3, and during reentry. They were required to practice AFTE for 15-minute inflight and apply control if symptoms occurred. Our findings indicate that 2 of the 3 astronauts receiving AFTE were successful at controlling symptoms in flight, while 2 of 3 controls were severely debilitated despite given anti-motion sickness medications.    <p></p>
Specific Objectives: 1) To determine individual baselines of physiological responses and tolerances to spatial disorientation in a rotating chair test simulating the  cross-coupled angular acceleration effects anticipated for Orion space craft re-entry; and 2) To evaluate AFTE effects for mitigating symptoms and improving tolerances to spatial disorientation.     <p></p>
Methods: Establish capability for providing remote AFTE training to any location. The study will include two groups of men and women, 10 subjects per group: Treatment - AFTE and Control no treatment. Each group will receive 4 exposures to rotating chair tests at one week intervals. All subjects will receive training on a manual dexterity and short-term memory task between tests 1 and 2. Subjects in the treatment group will receive a total of 6-hours AFTE training (two hours before the second, third, and fourth tests).     <p></p>
Deliverable: NASA Technical Memorandum and peer-reviewed journal article(s). We anticipate results of this study will demonstrate that AFTE provides crews with significantly better protection from the effects of spatial disorientation than adaptation training alone and without the side-effects of medication, thereby improving health,safety, and operational efficiency. <p></p>* [Chip-Scale Heterodyne Spectrometers for Cubesats and Small Landers](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j8bm-5ryj) - <p>Development of chip-size remote sensors for measuring atmospheric molecules and meteorology on Earth and on other planets. &nbsp;We specifically target usage on future interplanetary small platforms (e.g. smallsats, small landers).</p><p>The chip spectrometer operates on the principle of heterodyne detection. &nbsp;Heterodyne spectrometers offer ultra-high spectral resolution, without bulky dispersive elements or moving parts, and shot-noise-limited SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). &nbsp;Moreover, the chip spectrometer utilizes microfabrication to produce on-chip arrays wherein each array element (pixel) is a heterodyne spectrometer. &nbsp;Depending on the measurement objective, these on-chip nano-spectrometers can be configured either as spatial imaging pixels to enable imaging, or as spectral pixels for increasing spectral coverage. &nbsp;The chip detector resides in the focal plane of a mini-telescope to detect sunlight that has propagated through the planetary atmosphere. &nbsp;Amplitudes of absorption lines observed in the sunlight indicate molecular abundances, while ratios between different rotational-vibrational lines indicate atmospheric temperatures. &nbsp;Additionally, Doppler shifts in line-center wavelengths indicate wind speeds.</p>* [The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development.](https://data.nasa.gov/d/a3s4-zqy3) - Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development and has been proposed as a gravisensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days. Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins chemokines IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules. Importantly 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity. Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs. Total RNA samples extracted from Pthrp+/+and -/- trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) exposed for 6 days to simulated 0g in Synthecon rotating cell or left 6 days in culture at 1g. Cells had either been treated with a pulsatile treatment (2 h/day) of PTHrP1-36 peptide (10-8M) or received a change in growth medium. In total: 8 different conditions with 2 replicates each i.e. Pthrp+/+ TOs at 0g or 1g with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment and Pthrp-/- TOs at 0g or 1 g,with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment.* [Autonomous Diagnostic Imaging Performed by Untrained Operators Using Augmented Reality as a Form of](https://data.nasa.gov/d/isjn-e2xv) - Introduction     <p></p>
Imaging technologies are key to the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions that astronauts on an exploration mission might encounter and to research activities that characterize and understand the adaptations to micro- and partial gravity environments. Key limitations of the currently available imaging capabilities include the complexity and operator dependency of the procedures to acquire high quality results. Currently, two imaging procedures critical to space medicine and research, ultrasound and optical coherence tomography (OCT), are performed on the International Space Station (ISS) by astronauts with the assistance of real-time communication with experts on the ground using a method called remote guidance. With this methodology astronauts have acquired diagnostic and research quality data that are central to our understanding of the physiological consequences of weightlessness, including altered cardiac function, muscle atrophy, and the spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). However, with the time delay in communications that will be inherent in exploration missions while traveling great distances from Earth, remote guidance will no longer be practical, particularly when one-way transmissions may take up to 10 minutes or more. To fill this gap, we developed advanced audio-visual training modules, a form of just-in-time (JIT) training, to acquire medically necessary and research-relevant images. Building on our extensive experience with remote guidance of ISS astronauts and demonstrated success with just-in-time training, we employed an augmented reality (AR) system (Microsoft HoloLens) that included three-dimensional graphics of relevant anatomy, step-by-step audio instruction, reference images demonstrating adequate and inadequate quality, and troubleshooting guides. The ability of untrained subject-operators to acquire high-quality ultrasound and OCT images was evaluated by expert reviewers and compared to current JIT techniques for quality and time efficiency.     <p></p>
Methods     <p></p>
Tutorials to acquire ultrasound and OCT images were adapted for use as a PowerPoint presentation viewed either on a laptop computer or using an augmented reality platform with a heads-up display. Instructional material presented by the two different training modalities was identical, except that the augmented reality tutorial provided additional spatial guidance to complete the scanning protocols. Additional guidance included arrows superimposed on the ultrasound and OCT keyboards when specific controls were needed and virtual green dots superimposed on the body over the ultrasound targets' approximate locations to guide ultrasound probe placement. Twenty subjects attempted to acquire ultrasound and OCT images using the tutorials provided viewed on a laptop computer, and 20 subjects attempted the same diagnostic imaging procedures with instructions viewed using the AR system. No subject had prior experience performing these procedures or using this imaging hardware, and no subject participated in this study as a member of both groups. Subjects used guidance from the tutorials to acquire five ultrasound targets that constitute a subset of images in a trauma-induced injury assessment protocol (images of the heart, lungs, liver, kidney and spleen) and a single thirteen-line, vertical raster scan centered on the macula of the left eye using OCT. Time limits were imposed upon the subjects to acquire each of the ultrasound or OCT targets. This is not dissimilar to the environment on ISS or anticipated on future exploration missions in which communication windows or mission objectives can impact the available time to complete imaging procedures.     <p></p>
After the data collection session, subjects completed a survey to capture their thought about the equipment, procedures, instructional material, and future improvements. Images were stored by the subjects and evaluated off-line in a blind* [FY17 GRC: Shock/Corrosion Proof Bearings for Space Mechanisms](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5p6j-bree) - <p>Space mechanisms often present an unusual set of requirements for tribological components such as bearings. Highly corrosive, extreme temperature, dynamic loading, etc, environmental demands sometimes drive the choice of bearing design and/or material more so than the operational requirements. Frequently, no bearing material or technology exists to satisfy all of the unique requirements of a given space mechanism. The result is that one or more desired capabilities must be compromised (eg. life, power loss, speed).&nbsp;The vision of the proposed effort is&nbsp;to broaden the current capability of bearings through new materials and design practices to eliminate some of these compromises, enabling enhanced current and future mission prospects. A promising class of materials (Nickel Titanium (NiTi) alloys) have been shown to have significant potential for challenging bearing applications requiring high corrosion resistance and/or withstanding large shock loads in addition to the typical rigors of rotating machinery.&nbsp;The goal of this project is to demonstrate shock and corrosion resistant NiTi bearings to address limitations in current space mechanism bearing technology.</p>* [CERES Bidirectional Scans Aqua FM4 Edition4](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nq2g-58t6) - The Edition4 CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) for Flight Model 4 (FM4) on the Aqua spacecraft (CER_BDS_Aqua-FM4_Edition4) data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.

Namely the understanding of the physical processes and ability to protect the space vehicle from the harsh conditions encountered in hypersonic atmosphere entries must be expanded upon. Researchers depend on computational models and ground facility scale tests to study the performance of thermal protection systems [TPS] that protect space vehicles from the high temperature gases involved. However, the conditions reproduced at current complexes such as plasma flow wind tunnels cannot match simultaneously all of the actual flight conditions. More importantly, the aerothermal environment on the entire vehicle cannot be reproduced. It can only be approximated at few points such as the stagnation line. The need for proper uncertainty quantification and propagation of, including but not limited to, epistemic uncertainty of systems is outlined in section 11.3.6 of TA-11 as well as validation of modeling tools in section 11.3.8.1 of TA-11. The proposed work focuses on the development of a stochastic model for enhancing the ability to extrapolate arc-jet facility TPS data to flight conditions as well as validation and uncertainty quantification through Bayesian methods. It has been shown that even for small probes, radiative heating constitutes 10% of the total heat flux [Chazot]. However, current plasma flow wind tunnel methodologies are unable to reproduce the effects of the radiative processes or the Mach number of the flow experienced in hypersonic Mars return atmosphere entries. By applying a stochastic model to arc-jet facility data that accounts for the inability to recreate all flight conditions at the stagnation point, and propagation and quantification of uncertainty of the system, the confidence with which the results can be extrapolated will be increased and limitations made known. The statistical approach to model validation will be tested using EFT1 flight data. The construction of the stochastic model and planned uncertainty quantification and validation treatments will help increase the compatibility of ground facility results with flight conditions.* [Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q2x7-9u78) - Given the extended duration of future missions and the isolated, extreme and confined environments, there is the possibility that behavioral conditions and mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) will develop. The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool that unobtrusively integrates all available behavioral measures collected during a mission to provide a dashboard of behavioral health indicators. These indicators will be placed within the context of quantitatively-tracked mission stressors to provide meaningful feedback allowing behavioral issues to be detected and mitigated at an early stage. The result of this project will be a system prototype that can be deployed in space analog environments (e.g., Mars 520 study, Antarctica) for validation testing and ultimately deployed in long-duration space exploration missions. The critical need for an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP Integrated Research Plan (July 2009) gap BMED3. Phase II will achieve: (1) an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitor software interface; (2) a data integration system; (3) a trend and change detection algorithm; and (4) a countermeasure selection aid. The Technology Readiness Level at the end of Phase II will be TRL 6.* [Feasibility Study of a Magnetic Suspension System for Testing the Dynamic Stability of Blunt Bodies in NASA GRC’s 225 square centimeter Supersonic Wind Tunnel](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jyc5-fdkn) - The dynamic stability of blunt bodies during planetary entry is difficult to quantify as computational methods have yet to demonstrate accurate predictive capabilities and experimental methods cannot explicitly measure damping derivatives. Ballistic range testing has been used in the past to determine dynamic behavior of blunt body vehicles by firing test models down a test range from a gun at low supersonic Mach numbers. Photographs are taken of the test model during flight to monitor the capsule's position and angle. A 6-degree of freedom simulation is then fit to the data points captured by the photos and the capsule aerodynamics are returned. This method is an imperfect test set-up as the uniformity of conditions throughout the test range and the initial release state is variable. In addition, the primary test range used to capture data for the MSL entry vehicle, Eglin Air Force Base, was recently decommissioned.

The aim of this project is to conduct a feasibility study in order to determine design requirements for a magnetic suspension system in the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) 225 square centimeter Supersonic Wind Tunnel. This much-needed alternate method has the potential to measure damping coefficients more accurately than traditional ballistic range testing and wind tunnel tests with stings. In the proposed experimental set-up, a magnetic suspension system will balance the aerodynamic, gravitational and magnetic forces so the free-to-oscillate model is held in the test section. High-speed cameras will capture the model's position and angle of attack over time and a trajectory will be fit to these data points, much like ballistic range testing.

Although magnetic suspension has been used in the past, the proposed system will be a new, innovative implementation of this technology. Blunt body models have never been tested using magnetic suspension and a completely new positioning system will have to be designed, making this project a challenging design problem. The blunt body test models will comprise a non-magnetic material surrounding a spherical iron core. The geometry of the test model itself places a size limitation on the spherical iron core so the suspension system will have to be powerful enough to overcome this constraint.

Initial design questions regarding system implementation will be analyzed and answered by assessing problems in the wind tunnel operation, the magnetic suspension system and the design of the model. These problems will be evaluated using MATLAB for simulation purposes and wind tunnel tests. The main design questions to be answered include determining the lowest possible operating dynamic pressure so minimize the force on the magnet through a wind tunnel test, defining the allowable size of the model to avoid blockage but to provide enough magnetic force, and finally resolving the physical constraints of necessary visual and maintenance access despite a potentially massive magnetic suspension system surrounding the tunnel.

This project is important because a deep understanding of the behavior of capsules during entry is necessary for trajectory analysis as well as the safety of robotic or human missions. Magnetic suspension would allow for inexpensive testing of blunt body capsules so that dynamic aerodynamics coefficients can be determined to an improved or similar degree of accuracy as ballistic range testing. This project would serve to answer design questions that would be used to create an extremely beneficial modeling tool in the GRC 225 square centimeter tunnel as well as open the door to impactful innovations in magnetic suspension.* [Validation of the NSBRI Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification (ASTRO-CHARM) Integrated Cardiovascular Risk Calculator](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cier-qh9e) - In 2012, the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) supported the development of an integrated tool, termed the Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification (ASTRO-CHARM) Integrated Cardiovascular Risk Calculator. The initial version of this tool was delivered to NSBRI in February of 2014 and has already been implemented in spaceflight on an ad hoc basis. This project seeks to update and validate the ASTRO-CHARM calculator.     <p></p>
Specific Aim 1: To refine the ASTROCHARM tool using extended cardiovascular (CV) event data. Version 1 of the ASTROCHARM tool comprised 6782 subjects with a 159 CV events over a mean follow up of 7.5 years. Both the Dallas Heart Study (DHS) and Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) have now extended their CV event follow up to 10 years. Given the younger age of the cohort and resultant lower event rates, enhancing the endpoint numbers will provide more stability and accuracy for the updated risk score model (ASTRO-CHARM version 2.0).     <p></p>
Specific Aim 2: To validate the ASTROCHARM tool using the Framingham Heart Study coronary artery calcium (CAC) cohort. The ASTRO-CHARM tool demonstrated robust measures of internal validity when assessed in the original combined cohort. These included accurate event rate calibration, as well as improvement in the c-statistic and clinical risk reclassification compared with traditional risk factors alone. However, external validation in another cohort is essential before broader implementation. The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is the highly regarded original large U.S.-based population-based cohort, where CV risk scores originated. A cohort of the FHS underwent CAC scanning including 2740 subjects <65 years of age, with a mean 8 years of CV event follow up data, and is an ideal study in which to validate the ASTRO-CHARM model.     <p></p>
Specific Aim 3: To develop a mobile device application to facilitate broad implementation of the ASTRO-CHARM tool. The near universal availability of mobile technologies has enabled broader use of more sophisticated risk scores. Prior versions such as the Framingham Risk Score initially used tabular formats and adding of integer points, and were infrequently utilized in clinical practice. The Pooled Cohort Equation as part of the New 2013 ACC/AHA (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association) Cholesterol Guidelines has witnessed brisk uptake of a more complex algorithm, partly due to a well-received mobile app that has witnessed more than 64,000 downloads in its first two months.Once validated, a similar tool developed for the ASTROCHARM will greatly enhance its clinical impact.     <p></p>
ASTROCHARM Version 2. The investigators have extended endpoint data to include another 145 events (304 total), with a median follow up of 10.9 years. They have used these expanded endpoints to refine the ASTRO-CHARM calculator and assessed measures of internal validity of the new calculator including discrimination and calibration which were all robust. They applied the ASTRO-CHARM model to the Framingham Heart Study CAC cohort (n=2057). The ASTRO-CHARM calculator showed good discrimination (c-statistic 0.79) and calibration (Goodness-of-Fit Chi-square: 13.2, p=0.16) in the Framingham study. The authors developed a prototype iPhone app for the ASTRO-CHARM and demonstrated this tool to NASA/NSBRI in late July of 2016. They are preparing the manuscript for scientific publication and the app for broad dissemination for NASA/NSBRI and terrestrial medicine applications. <p></p>* [SMEX03 Airborne GPS Bistatic Radar Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j7gx-bipf) - This data set contains measurements of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals reflected from the Earths surface and collected on an airborne platform. The measurements were taken over the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) regional study areas of Brazil and Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA. The primary objective was to collect land reflections for sensitivity of the reflected GPS power to temporal and spatial soil moisture and foliage attenuation. The measurements are a form of bistatic radar and can be used to estimate the surface scattering coefficient, such as roughness and/or dielectric properties, as well as path delays between the direct and reflected GPS signals. Scattering coefficients can then be used to estimate changes in surface soil moisture. The reflections collected were from agricultural land in Brazil, Alabama, and Georgia, along with grassland in Oklahoma.

innovative receiver is based on the integration of a microwave
interferometer coupled with a pulsed laser to generate the ultrasound.
By using a microwave interferometer design we will be able to overcome
the limitation generally associated with classical optical receiver: 1)
Inability to work in harsh environment where thermal and mechanical
perturbations are present; 2) Reduction in sensitivity caused by the
speckle nature of the light reflected from rough surfaces; 3) High
system cost due the price of the different lasers, optics and
engineering to develop an optical system working in a harsh environment
and 4) high maintenance cost (Lasers and optics need to be checked,
maintained and re-aligned frequently).* [SMEX03 Two-Dimensional Synthetic Aperture Radiometer (2D-STAR) Brightness Temperatures, Alabama](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uu2f-vask) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC.

This data set includes dual-polarized L-band brightness temperatures measured by the Two-Dimensional Synthetic Aperture Radiometer (2D-STAR) instrument. An aircraft carrying the instrument was flown over Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma USA on various dates from 25 June to 15 July 2003 as part of the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03). The 2D-STAR is a research instrument developed under the NASA Instrument Incubator Program with an aim to demonstrate the capability of the two-dimensional aperture synthesis radiometer at low frequency (approximately 1.4 GHz) to observe surface variables such as soil moisture and ocean salinity.

Modern spacecraft payloads demand high throughput while maintaining extremely high levels of reliability and fault tolerance.  Currently, no standardized protocols presently offer space-level products that provide gigabit-class throughputs.  One-off protocols have many drawbacks including long development times, high potential for error, a lack of existing materials, and do not lend themselves to easy prototyping since COTS products are unavailable.   

These chips will retain the power of using the Ethernet standard but will be extended in an innovative way that will allow data rates up to 8 Gbps per port but will still be compatible with ground hardware for development purposes.  Through automated fault monitoring the PHY chip will be automatically detect link failures and the only adverse effect will be a reduction in throughput.* [Ultra-low Noise, High Bandwidth, 1550nm HgCdTe APD, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6uwx-xv6g) - To meet the demands of future high-capacity free space optical communications links, a high bandwidth, near infrared (NIR), single photon sensitive optoelectronic receiver will be designed, manufactured, and demonstrated. The unique vertical charge transport electron avalanche photodiode (EAPD) exploits the bandgap properties of HgCdTe to achieve high quantum efficiency and avalanche multiplication that preferentially ionizes electrons to achieve nearly noiseless gain exceeding 1000 with an excess noise factor approaching 1.0 and bandwidths greater than 500 MHz. In Phase II, a segmented 1 mm x 1 mm back-illuminated detector will be integrated with a low noise CMOS integrated circuit to realize a photoreceiver capable of both single photon detection and photon number discrimination. Unlike Geiger Mode detectors, the receiver can operate at 77K, without the limitations of afterpulsing, so that dark current can de reduced and bit errors rates reduced. A cold laser line filter is used to select the spectral response anywhere within the 1064-2400 nm spectral band. 

Optical communications has been identified as a critical technology for future NASA missions, and the innovation satisfied the currently unmet need for a single photon sensitive, large area, high bandwidth NIR photoreceivers that is not served by contemporary approaches.* [MeshSLAM: Robust Localization and Large-Scale Mapping in Barren Terrain, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/csn8-bd5q) - Robots need to know their location to map of their surroundings but without global positioning data they need a map to identify their surroundings and estimate their location. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solves these dual problems at once. SLAM does not depend on any kind of infrastructure and is thus a promising localization technology for NASA planetary missions and for many terrestrial applications as well. However, state-of-the-art SLAM depends on easily-recognizable landmarks in the robot's environment, which are lacking in barren planetary surfaces. Our work will develop a technology we call MeshSLAM, which constructs robust landmarks from associations of weak features extracted from terrain. Our test results will also show that MeshSLAM applies to all environments in which NASA's rovers could someday operate: dunes, rocky plains, overhangs, cliff faces, and underground structures such as lava tubes. Another limitation of SLAM for planetary missions is its significant data-association problems. As a robot travels it must infer its motion from the sensor data it collects, which invariably suffers from drift due to random error. To correct drift, SLAM recognize when the robot has returned to a previously-visited place, which requires searching over a great deal of previously-sensed data. Computation on such a large amount of memory may be infeasible on space-relevant hardware. MeshSLAM eases these requirements. It employs topology-based map segmentation, which limits the scope of a search. Furthermore, a faster, multi-resolution search is performed over the topological graph of observations. Mesh Robotics LLC and Carnegie Mellon University have formed a partnership to commercially develop MeshSLAM. MeshSLAM technology will be available via open source, to ease its adoption by NASA. In Phase 1 of our project we will show the feasibility of MeshSLAM for NASA and commercial applications through a series of focused technical demonstrations.* [Measurement and Assessment of Flow Quality in Wind Tunnels, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uefv-qkxe) - With increased commercial competition, great pressure is being applied to effect aerodynamic design changes that will improve fuel economy and performance. But, for example, as we are now concerned with small changes in drag count, potential sources of improvement are much more likely to be masked by poor flow quality.  We may have reached the stage where the lack of suitable facility flow quality will hinder and dictate the rate of progress of ground based testing.  Few measurements have been made in the Nation's wind tunnels, and in those cases, large discrepancies have been found between full-scale and predicted performance.  Consequently, there is an urgent need for in-situ measurements to measure flow quality and the performance of turbulence and noise suppression devices.  To meet these challenges, a unique research program is proposed to clarify and alleviate the aerodynamic problems associated with adverse wind tunnel flow quality.  It combines innovative advances in data base assessment and management, and new approaches to turbulence instrumentation and analysis.  Standardized turbulence measurement techniques and data analysis procedures will be established and used to document the flow quality in our major test facilities.* [Measurement and Assessment of Flow Quality in Wind Tunnels, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/eaev-rahe) - New wind tunnel flow quality test and analysis procedures have been developed and will be used to establish standardized turbulent flow quality measurement techniques and data reduction procedures for future flow quality studies in the National Transonic Wind Tunnel (NTF) and other Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) facilities.  To date, few measurements have been made of the characteristics of freestream turbulence in transonic wind tunnels, and details of the amplitude and spectra of freestream velocity and pressure fluctuations is lacking.  Consequently, there is an urgent need for in-situ measurements to determine flow quality and the performance of turbulence and noise suppression devices. This information is required if we are to accurately assess and characterize ground test facility performance. To meet these challenges, a unique research program is proposed to clarify and alleviate the aerodynamic problems associated with adverse wind tunnel flow quality.  It combines innovative advances in data base assessment and management, and new approaches to turbulence instrumentation and analysis.  Standardized turbulence measurement techniques and data analysis procedures will be established and used to document the flow quality in our major test facilities.* [GPM GROUND VALIDATION AUTONOMOUS PARSIVEL UNIT (APU) NSSTC V1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wjbd-uwww) - The GPM Ground Validation Autonomous Parsivel Unit (APU) NSSTC dataset was collected by the Autonomous Parsivel Unit (APU), which is an optical disdrometer based on single particle extinction that measures particle size and fall velocity. This APU consists of the Parsivel, which was developed by OTT in Germany, and its support systems, which were designed and built by the University of Alabama in Huntsville. This dataset provides rainfall data for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission Ground Validation Experiment collected at the National Space Science Technology Center (NSSTC) in Huntsville, Alabama. The validation effort will entail numerous GPM-specific and joint-agency/international external field campaigns, using state of the art cloud and precipitation observational infrastructure. Surface rainfall will be measured by very dense rain gauge and disdrometer networks at various field campaign sites. There may be occasional gaps in the data when the instrument is not resident at the NSSTC and is sent to participate in field campaigns.* [CER_BDS_Terra-FM1_Edition4](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pwwz-g739) - The Edition4 CERES BiDirectional Scans (BDS) for Flight Model 1 (FM1) on the Terra spacecraft (CER_BDS_Terra-FM1_Edition4) data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.

Because of forgetfulness, this person may realize activities of daily living erroneously. In order to assist this person automatically in Smart Home, all his performed actions and activities are observed through the embedded sensors of Smart Home, and applying the data mining techniques his activities are analyzed. Then information about his activities is provided and in the consequence, comparing learned correct patterns and current observations the Smart Home may infer provision of assistance to this person at the appropriate moment. In this paper we propose a data-driven activity modeling approach, which supports reasoning in correct realization of the activities. Activities are presumed as the series of fuzzy events that occur shortly one after another. Per each activity, we calculate a fuzzy conceptual structure, and the model of activity is represented in form of a multivariable problem.* [Lunar Health Monitor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/crmd-cpcq) - Orbital Research has successfully demonstrated a dry electrode (no electrolyte or gel required) for heart rate and ECG monitoring.

The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format, and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional Synthesis - Description of Observations and Models.* [Rapid Development of Flight Software for a Complete Guidance, Navigation, and Control Subsystem Using Simulinkâs Auto-coding Capabilities](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8yqb-e8h3) - <p>The proposed task will create new processes and tools for automatically generating flight code for the entire Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) subsystem&nbsp;using the approach of&nbsp;translating GNC models generated by commercially available modeling and simulation tool(s) into multiple&nbsp;software applications for&nbsp;the standard&nbsp;flight software (FSW) architecture used by the Goddard Space Flight Center.

Anxiety-Management Countermeasure](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9rgt-r3c9) - <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
                      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<p>1. Original Project aims/objectives: Stress and anxiety-related
  problems are some of the most common and costly behavioral health
  problems in society. For those working in operational environments
  (i.e., astronauts, flight controllers, military), stress and
  anxiety-related problems before, during, or after missions can
  seriously compromise efficiency, safety, and performance. To address
  behavioral health issues like stress, it is important to maximize the
  privacy, validity, and acceptability of the countermeasures used. Our
  project had two specific aims: 1) to develop an evidence-based,
  autonomous, multimedia program to train users to manage stress and
  build resilience; 2) to evaluate the program in a randomized
  controlled trial (RCT). The program is called SMART-OP (Stress
  Management and Resilience Training for Optimal Performance). The
  six-session cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based program includes
  education about stress, and interactive training exercises that teach
  users to monitor stress, regulate emotions and relax, think flexibly,
  be realistic, and take effective action to deal with stressors. The
  content of the program can be modified to target different populations
  who work in challenging environments (e.g., astronauts, military, and
  flight controllers) and could be disseminated widely via computer,
  tablet, or smartphone. 2. Key Findings: We recently evaluated SMART-OP
  in an RCT with a sample of stressed but otherwise healthy University
  of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Law and Business School students
  (N=66). SMART-OP was compared to an attention control (AC) group that
  received marketed stress management information (i.e., videos and
  reading material). Interested participants were screened to ensure
  they met study eligibility criteria (no medical or psychiatric
  conditions, were stressed based on a self-report stress score, and a
  UCLA graduate student). Two hundred and thirty individuals expressed
  interest in the study, 169 were screened, and 80 were eligible.
  Participants (N = 66) were randomized to SMART-OP or AC and were
  evaluated on self-report measures and performance on The Trier Social
  Stress Test (TSST). Participants also evaluated the program for
  usefulness and usability. Fifty-nine participants completed all
  training sessions and assessments. The SMART-OP group reported
  significantly less stress, more perceived control over stress, and
  rated the program as significantly more useful than the AC group.
  During the TSST, the SMART-OP group showed a more adaptive within-task
  recovery at post-assessment based on a-amylase data (a biomarker of
  stress). SMART-OP received an excellent score on a measure of
  usability. 3. Impact of key findings on hypotheses, technology
  requirements, objectives, and specific aims of the original proposal:
  Our RCT key findings indicate that SMART-OP is highly usable and is a
  more effective and useful stress management training program than an
  educational comparison. These findings support our initial hypotheses
  that the self-guided interactive multimedia stress management and
  resilience training program would be a useful and acceptable method of
  training to the user, and an effective stress management
  countermeasure. Our findings are consistent with the growing
  literature on technology-based behavioral health interventions which
  report that such programs are effective and acceptable forms of
  treatment. SMART-OP only requires a computer for use so it can be used
  confidentially at a time and place of the user's choosing. The program
  can also be modified for use by nearly any population as well as
  tablet or smartphone platforms. We also met our two main aims and
  objectives of our original proposal-- to develop an evidence-based
  autonomous,* [Biosensors for Exploration Medical System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/78hr-6r2q) - The current International Space Station (ISS) ECG (electrocardiogram) system for donning the biomedical sensors is time consuming and inconvenient, requiring shaving, application of electrodes, and signal checks. A more efficient ECG system will save crew time and reduce the overhead of stowing additional supplies. Additionally, the current ECG hardware requires dedicated ISS power and significant volume, but advances in microelectronics has significantly reduced the volume and power required for ECG applications.  The Biosensors-EMSD (Exploration Medical System Demonstration) will demonstrate the integration of small, battery powered, easy to use biomedical sensors and data acquisition devices that will have the ability to measure, store, and transmit physiologic parameters during operational and ambulatory scenarios.    
Specific Aims:     
1. Demonstrate that commercial off the shelf (COTS) and emerging technologies satisfy exploration physiological monitoring requirements and operational requirements    
2. Reduce the time required of an on-orbit crew and ground personnel to store, access, transfer, and process physiological data    
3. Provide a mechanism for interfacing biomedical sensor technology with a common data management framework and architecture to enable the EMSD objectives.    
The functionality of the ECG system will be verified through a ground demonstration and an ISS flight demonstration, both as part of the Exploration Medical System Demonstration.  The project will begin with a market survey of available COTS ECG systems that meet physiological monitoring requirements followed by a direct COTS procurement.  The ECG system will then be tested and verified for proper capabilities by CMO analogs.  Ground testing will require CMO analogs to don the ECG system and execute a series of predetermined tasks while a variety of ECG data and video is collected.  ECG data and video will be examined to ensure data quality, appropriate data routing, and to demonstrate system efficiency.  Flight testing will be similar to ground testing, but may not be as comprehensive given in-flight resource limitations.  The availability of more varied medical condition simulations, more extensive supply of power, fewer time and space limitations, and enhanced system characterization capabilities will allow the ground demonstration to expand the on-orbit objectives by assessing system effectiveness and performance.* [Autonomous Melt-Probe Penetration of Dirty Ice with Clean Sampling for Life Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c7pf-2ivu) - Access to subsurface material and oceans through water-ice crusts is a goal common to exploration of all ocean worlds. Probes that melt their way through ice are, thus far, the only technology demonstrated to penetrate ice autonomously to depths on the order of kilometers, as will be required to reach an ocean on, e.g., Europa. Moreover, melt probes operate in ice at all relevant temperatures, with internal temperatures for electronics and instrumentation near 273K. Such probes are thus strong candidates for subsurface access and life detection on ocean worlds.

However, an ocean worlds melt probe will have to penetrate ice laden with particulates from, e.g., meteoritic or comet dust infall, which accumulate in front of the probe, insulate the melt head, and arrest progress. At the same time, the probe must acquire melt- or ocean-water samples and deliver them without contamination to life-detection instruments. These functions must be accomplished under more severe constraints on power (in foreseeable landed systems) than previous melt probes can meet.

Melt probe power requirements decrease rapidly with decreasing size. We show that a probe with dimensions near those of our small, newly field-tested probe could attain meter-per-hour descent speeds on ocean worlds, even at 100K temperature, using thermal power comparable to that generated radiogenically in a General Purpose Heat Source. Such speeds are sufficient to reach kilometers-deep subglacial water within a nominal 30-day lander life time.

Such an approach would entail major commitments of engineering effort and national resources of plutonium. Precisely because the commitments would be large, it is critical to establish first that essential, component-level functions of subsurface exploration can actually be demonstrated in sufficiently small probes. Primary technical risks on a path to flight hardware therefore entail simplification and size-reduction of hardware to penetrate ‘dirty’ ice, and to acquire ‘clean’ samples for life-detection. The objective of this project is retirement of those risks.

We bring to this work unique experience in each component. Two members of our team have developed a simple, robust probe, which has reached 400 m depth in Greenland and demonstrated penetration rates of 6.6 meters per hour (these are the second-greatest depth and highest speed achieved by melt probes on Earth to date). We have demonstrated autonomous descent based on the geometry and power-balance in our probe, rather than computationally intensive control algorithms. Our third team member has developed and tested in Antarctica a melt-probe based, microbiologically and geochemically clean sampling system, the size and complexity of which we will reduce.

Our specific objectives are thus: (1) to develop a simplified pump and jetting mechanism (currently TRL 3), integrate it with our field-tested melt probe (TRL 4), and to quantify in the laboratory, the characteristics of particle-laden ice that the system can penetrate as a function of jetting parameters; (2) to develop, initially also in the laboratory, clean acquisition and transfer of water samples (currently TRL 3-4 based on Antarctic field experience); and finally (3) to demonstrate dirty ice penetration and clean sampling in an integrated system small enough to be powered radiogenically on ocean worlds, and in a relevant environment (to a depth of 50 m on a dusty alpine glacier in Washington State, with our exit TRL at or approaching TRL 5).

We presently envision the next step toward mission implementation to be testing in ice simulating that on ocean-worlds surface at relevant temperatures. We are in active conversation with the JPL Space Technology Program Office on mission implementation.* [STARwatch to Deliver Objective Sleep Measures for Spaceflight Operations, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/8frb-eu93) - This project will achieve a wrist-worn actigraphy device called STARwatch, designed specifically for space exploration environments. It will provide a minimally obtrusive, objective measure that evaluates astronaut sleep-wake activity and light exposure. This project will leverage our second generation actigraphy device that has already been validated in controlled laboratory experiments against gold-standard polysomnography. The compact wrist-worn device includes sensors to collect sleep metrics and will also serve as a wireless hub to collect real-time physiological data from other body-worn sensors (e.g., heart rate, EEG). It will use standardized wireless communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth) to automatically uplink data to the ISS network (no astronaut time required). Data will automatically be integrated into medical operations support systems (e.g., BHP-Dashboard) to provide immediate feedback to astronauts and flight surgeons to aid in decision-making relative to astronaut medical, behavioral health and performance issues. During Phase I, we will develop an enhanced STARwatch, integrate data from other body worn sensors (e.g., heart rate sensor), demonstrate automatic data streaming using approaches compatible with the ISS network environment, and develop a plan for operational validation and spaceflight certification that will be implemented during Phase II (Phase I TRL of 4-5).* [Non-Invasive Transcranial Doppler Sonogram Device for Detection of Embolic Air in Cerebral Arteries, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2bpv-jz6p) - Technology is needed to provide real-time assessment and evaluation of hematological parameters during prolong space flights and planetary missions.  A key hematological parameter is the monitoring and measurement of emboli in the brain especially during Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) on planetary surfaces as well as orbital flights. A non-invasive, compact Transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurement device will provide monitoring of flight crew blood physiology during extended duration missions and deliver this data to onboard flight surgeons.  

To address this need, GeneXpress Informatics (GXI) and Leonid Bunegin and Dr. Claudia S. Miller of the University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSC) at San Antonio proposes to develop a non-invasive, portable TCD sonogram based diagnostic system for real-time monitoring and detection of cerebral artery air embolisms.   The detection system uses intensity audio signals and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to detect and locate the TCD audio signals of air bubbles in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). 

In Phase I, GXI proposes to develop and demonstrate the non-invasive use TCD measurements for the determination of air emboli.  In Phase II, GXI will proceed to a prototype development which will include construction and fabrication of a handheld field portable frequency-domain TCD measurement system.* [Drill Embedded Nanosensors for Planetary Subsurface Exploration](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q4uy-cbfr) - <p>We have developed a carbon nanotube (CNT) sensor for water vapor detection under Martian Conditions and the miniaturized electronics can be embedded in the drill bit for collecting sensor data and transmitting it to a computer wirelessly. This capability will enable the real time measurement of ice during drilling. With this real time and in-situ measurement, subsurface ice detection can be easy, fast, precise and low cost.<p/><p>Current methods for sensing icy deposits on Mars or the moon include volume hydrogen measurements in a 1m3 volume from a surface neutron spectrometer, optical spectral measurements to identify water spectral lines, or direct analysis of samples using mass spectroscopy. The latter two methods require samples to be on the surface or fed into an instrument. The detection limit of optical spectroscopy is ~1% water ice in a cuttings mixture. In contrast CNT sensor's detection limit is 10-6 – 10-9 and the sensors are tiny with significantly lower power usage compared to other instruments. The drill mounted CNT sensor can also detect ice as it is encountered by the drill bit at very low concentrations, obtaining fine scale information on the vertical structure of the icy material. Potentially, CNT sensors combined with drilling afford a new approach for detection and measurement of volatiles. With CIF support in 2013, we started with CNT sensors that operate under Earth conditions optimized to sense organic volatiles and developed a CNT sensor capable of detecting water vapor, requiring special coatings applied to the CNT.  We characterized the sensor performance under Mars pressure (~6mbar) and temperature (-45oC) conditions, showing that it could detect small quantities of water vapor introduced into its vicinity. We compared our CNT sensor with commercially available RH sensors. The test results show that commercial sensors do not work under vacuum conditions. So, our CNT sensors exceed the performance of these commercial sensors for Martian conditions.   We miniaturized the sensor, and constructed data acquisition and wireless communication electronics to fit inside a drill string.  The wireless communications allows us to transmit the CNT sensor signal from the borehole without bringing wires through the rotating interface. We then constructed a simulated borehole and drill string and tested sensor performance detecting small quantities of water vapor under Martian conditions. The wireless communication board can transmit the sensor data to a USB receiver plugged into a computer for data streaming. The work remaining is to complete sensor installation into a drill string and test it drilling into icy material in a Mars environment, which requires a Mars chamber that requires use of unique Mars drill testing facilities at Honeybee Robotics.  Possible applications of CNT sensors for water detection include prospecting for buried ice on the Moon, and characterizing feedstocks for ISRU on the moon or Mars.  An ISRU demonstration proposal to the Mars 2020 rover has expressed interest.  CNT borehole instruments that detect volatiles like methane should interest the fuels industry.</p>* [CERES Bidirectional Scans Terra FM1 Edition3](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dwud-6dtt) - CER_BDS_Terra-FM1_Edition3 data are CERES geolocated and calibrated TOA filtered radiances and other instrument data.Each Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) BiDirectional Scans (BDS) data product contains twenty-four hours of Level-1b data for each CERES scanner instrument mounted on each spacecraft.

Finding these planets poses significant technical challenges. Firstly, nearly all current instruments lack the sensitivity to detect habitable-zone planets with masses less than five times that of Earth’s. Secondly, a planet’s radius and mass, and thus its density and internal composition, can only be estimated through the combined data from both transit and radial velocity measurements. Thirdly and most considerably, definitive detection of such planets requires the observations of many orbits in order to obtain a time-averaged signal. This level of cadence is unfeasible in the existing framework of shared telescope time, and currently there are few observatories dedicated to exoplanet science.

The Minerva project will address these limitations by building a ground-based telescope array, capable of both transit science and radial velocimetry, dedicated to the detection of terrestrial planets around nearby stars. Four 0.7-meter telescopes will each be equipped with an imaging camera and will fiber-feed to a single high-resolution spectrometer. The multi-telescope model affords Minerva the flexibility to observe in formation, with a synthesized aperture of 1.4m, or take simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric measurements.

Perhaps the most unique feature of Minerva will be its availability to search for planets every single clear night. To accomplish this, the observatory will be fully robotic; all components of the telescope array and instrument suite will need to operate autonomously. The Minerva software will control multiple telescopes and a number of instruments simultaneously, requiring precise synchronization and complex data handling. The system must be robust and efficient in recovering from any errors encountered. My task is to lead the design of the Minerva software, thereby solving the problem of how to efficiently and robustly manage a complex distributed-aperture robotic observatory with an extensive instrument suite. I plan to base the software architecture on the modular and highly efficient model developed for Robo-AO, a successfully operating fully robotic adaptive optics system. I have personally developed routines for Robo-AO and hope to adapt the system to meet Minerva’s unique requirements.

Minerva will directly address a multitude of technical challenges put forth by NASA’s Space Technology Roadmaps. Firstly, the distributed-aperture model is immediately matched to TA8.2.3: Distributed Aperture Observatories. Secondly, the complex robotic system will necessarily advance technologies in the field of autonomy, specifically the following areas:  TA4.5.4: Multi-Agent Coordination, TA4.5.2: Dynamic Planning and Sequencing Tools, and finally TA4.5.3: Autonomous Guidance and Control.* [Advanced Ground Systems Maintenance Anomaly Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uf5b-v8n4) - <p>The Inductive Monitoring System (IMS) software utilizes techniques from the fields of model-based reasoning, machine learning, and data mining to build system monitoring knowledge bases from archived or simulated sensor data. Unlike some other machine learning techniques, IMS does not require examples of anomalous (failure) behavior. IMS automatically analyzes nominal system data to form general classes of expected system sensor values. This process enables the software to inductively learn and model nominal system behavior. The generated data classes are then used to build a monitoring knowledge base. In real-time,</p><p>IMS performs monitoring functions, determining and displaying the degree of deviation from nominal performance. IMS trend analyses can detect conditions that may indicate a failure or required system maintenance. The development of the IMS was motivated by the difficulty of producing detailed diagnostic models of some system components due to complexity or unavailability of design information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project will develop the capability to identify anomalous conditions (indications to potential impending system failure) in ground system operations before such failures occur. These indicators are not presently detectable by traditional command and control and fault detection systems. &nbsp;This project enables the delivery of system&#39;s health advisories to ground system operators so they can take action prior to experiencing systems failures.&nbsp;Inductive Monitoring System (IMS)&nbsp;detected&nbsp;anomalies can be sent to a diagnostic software&nbsp;module for diagnosis.</p><p>Anomaly Detection provides the 21st Century Launch Complex Program with the ability to identify/recognize systems&#39; anomalies before they become faults in the system; it supports the resolution of such anomalies to assure system availability and mission success.

A SiP microradiometer has a spectral responsivity spanning 305-1,640 nm with 10 decades of dynamic range and can be pointed at the Sun, Moon, sky, or sea without saturating. The principal OCULLAR objective is to increase this dynamic range to 14 decades with demonstrated linear calibration. The extra 6 decades of dynamic range from the PMT (2 overlap with the SiP, netting 14 decades) significantly improve the measurement of apparent optical properties (AOPs) under moonlight, which has already been demonstrated to be possible with existing SiP microradiometers, although there are challenges with ultraviolet (UV) channels. Increasing the dynamic range of the sensors will overcome the present limitations and allow unprecedented new research. For example, diurnal processes in the ocean and atmosphere can be studied optically using moonlight as the light source.</p> <p>The principal objective of the OCULLAR project is to pair a PMT with a SiP microradiometer where their overlapping sensitivities maximize the dynamic range at each wavelength to create a new hybrid sensor class, called a <em>hybridnamic multitecto</em>r.&nbsp; Ultimately, hybridnamic multitectors will feature up to 14 decades of dynamic range, spanning the UV to near-infrared (NIR), depending on the photocathode material of the PMT, and will be used to measure the AOPs of the ocean and atmosphere. AOP measurements, by definition, require a light source. Typically, the Sun is used because it provides sufficient flux across an extensive spectral domain for a wide diversity of detectors. Although some measurements have been made using the Moon as a light source, in general, the diurnal cycle of oceanic and atmospheric optical parameters are poorly understood, because of the paucity of instruments that can make high-quality observations in low-light conditions. Similarly, observations in highly turbid conditions are sparse, because signal levels quickly reach the noise level of existing detector systems. The inability to make accurate measurements at low-light levels has restricted the understanding of other important light-based phenomena. This means high latitude processes can be investigated during the substantial time of the year when light levels are restricted to twilight, moonlight, or very low solar elevations. Other areas of new research using OCULLAR sensors include the study of coral spawning, plankton vertical migration, bioluminescence, the onset of the spring bloom under polar ice sheets, characterization of the environment experienced by pelagic predators (e.g., tuna and squid), plus the use of very narrow bandwidths to exploit specific spectral signatures of oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Although the prototype sensor is anticipated to be deployed into the ocean, recent advances in exploiting microradiometers for airborne applications (e.g., C-AIR flights with Ames Research Center), suggests <em>Ocean Color at Night</em> or <em>Validating the Black Marble</em> using OCULLAR sensors are tractable problems.</p>* [Intelligent Temporal Data Driven World Actuation in Ambient Environments Case Study: Anomaly Recognition and Assistance Provision in Smart Home](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bway-y43c) - Abstract — A possible resident of smart home is an old person or an Alzheimer patient that should be assisted continuously for the rest of his life; however, normally this person desires to live independently at home. Typically, this person may forget sometimes completion of the activities; may realize the activities of daily living incorrectly, and may enter to dangerous states. In this context smart home project is proposed as an ambient intelligent environment, in which on one hand the resident is observed continuously through the embedded sensors, and on the other hand the resident is assisted automatically through the embedded electronically controllable actuators. In this work, we propose an approach to interpret the sensors’ observations and how to automatically reason in the required assistance. The result is provision of automated assistance for the smart home resident.* [Ground-Based Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) Observation Data (full-rate, daily, 24 hour files) from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jyds-z6r6) - This dataset consists of ground-based Satellite Laser Ranging observation data (full-rate, daily 24 hour files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). SLR provides unambiguous range measurements to mm precision that can be aggregated over the global network to provide very accurate satellite orbits, time histories of station position and motion, and many other geophysical parameters. SLR operates in the optical region and is the only space geodetic technique that measures unambiguous range directly. Analysis of SLR data contributes to the terrestrial reference frame, modeling of the spatial and temporal variations of the Earth's gravitational field, and monitoring of millimeter-level variations in the location of the center of mass of the total Earth system (solid Earth-atmosphere-oceans). In addition, SLR provides precise orbit determination for spaceborne radar altimeter missions. It provides a means for sub-nanosecond global time transfer, and a basis for special tests of the Theory of General Relativity. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) retrieve SLR data on regular schedules to produce precise station positions and velocities for stations in the ILRS network. The daily SLR full-rate observation files contain data received in the previous 24-hour period from a global network of stations ranging to satellites equipped with retroreflectors. Data are available in ILRS data format (older data sets) and/or the Consolidated Ranging Data (CRD) format. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/SLR/Full-rate_data.html.* [Air-to-Air UAV Aerial Refueling](https://data.nasa.gov/d/fp2g-zn8q) - <p>Armstrong researchers, in cooperation with Northrop Grumman Corporation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) demonstrated autonomous aerial refueling between two unmanned, high-altitude aircraft. NASA's two Global Hawk UAVs, one outfitted as a receiver and the other as a tanker, flew a series of demonstration flights to validate advanced UAV-to-UAV aerial refueling control system technology. The two Global Hawk aircraft successfully flew for the first time as close as 30 feet in formation. In addition, the aircraft rendezvoused and flew for  more than 2.5 hours under autonomous formation control, the majority of time within 100 feet (or one wingspan) of each other. This research effort (referred to as the KQ-X project), is a follow-on to NASA's Autonomous Aerial Refueling Demonstration (AARD) project, in which manned aircraft operating on autopilot functioned as surrogate UAVs to test flight control and optical tracking systems. Work to date: The demonstration flights occurred between January and May 2012 and achieved many milestones. The lead receiver aircraft extended and retracted its aerial refueling hose several times, completing all planned tests to validate the associated program hardware and software. In addition, the trailing tanker aircraft successfully demonstrated precision control in formation with manual and automated "breakaway" maneuvers, which are important safety features and criteria of the test program. Looking ahead: Next steps involve further tests with unmanned aircraft. The team is looking for an industry partner to advance these development efforts. Partners: DARPA, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Sierra Nevada Corporation Benefits In-flight refueling: Allows UAVs to fulfill longer missions with longer flights Increased mission scope: Permits more flexibility in UAV use Long-term station keeping: Reduces the number of take-offs and landings to fulfill a given mission Automated refueling: Relieves pilots of burdensome flight refueling missions Applications UAV refueling Formation flight Automated manned aircraft refueling</p>* [Detection of Life Forms, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2bnu-d57w) - Gaia Genomics proposes to develop an instrument for the detection of earthborn and/or planetary life forms that are based on a nucleic acid paradigm.  Highly sensitive reagents will be developed to detect DNA- or RNA-based organisms.  The components of the proposed system are simple, rugged, stable, and inexpensive, and detection will be both rapid and highly sensitive.  In Phase I, we will synthesize the diagnostic reagents and demonstrate proof-of-concept by their ability to detect nucleic acids.  In Phase II, they will be incorporated into a portable prototype instrument designed for single- or multi-sample detection.  The resulting device will be ideal for use as a survey tool for NASA Astrobiology interplanetary missions (Topic S4, Sub-topic 05).* [Wideband Radio Frequency Interference Detection for Microwave Radiometer Subsystem](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gnsu-dxsb) - Anthropogenic Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) is threatening the quality and utility of multi-frequency passive microwave radiometry. The GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission launched on February 27, 2014 is already seeing RFI in the 10.7 and 18.7 GHz channels. It is important to understand that these frequency bands are strictly protected for science data measurement; yet, it is still corrupted by RFI. Indeed, this issue has led to the development of the first spaceborne digital RFI mitigation radiometer operating at 1.4 GHz for the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission. We leverage our experience on SMAP to develop innovative technology for wider-bandwidth higher-frequency radiometers.

The objective of this proposal is to develop a wideband (200-1000 MHz) digital detector subsystem and to demonstrate innovative RFI detection and removal techniques for microwave radiometers. The techniques proposed, complex valued kurtosis detector and independent component analysis (ICA), have the potential to improve the RFI detection rate in high frequency bandwidth. We are responding to a national imperative to develop RFI mitigation technology for future spaceflight radiometers. "Spectrum Management for the Twenty-first Century" recommends the continued development of so-called non-cooperative mitigation technologies. The Earth Science Technology roadmap for Advanced Microwave Components and Systems seeks “Demonstration of RFI mitigation approaches, and algorithms for future RFI environments to 40 GHz and beyond.” These two National Research Council reports emphasize the importance of RFI mitigation technology for sustaining a reliable national passive microwave remote sensing capability.* [Diagnosis-Driven Prognosis for Decision Making, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tay5-acps) - One cannot build a system-level Prognosis and Health Management (PHM) solution by cobbling together a bunch of existing prognostic techniques; it will have a very high rate of false-positive indications. On the other hand, if a system-level health management solution could identify the individual degradations and indictors associated with those degradations, and thereby decouple the problem into smaller pieces, the existing prognostic techniques could still be used to predict time to failure, and could therefore drive an effective Condition Based Maintenance and Decision Support System (CBM+).

Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI) and Vanderbilt University team seeks to develop a system-level diagnostic and prognostic process and a "sense and respond capability" which first uses error codes and discrete sensor values to correctly diagnose the system health including degradations and failures of sensors and components, and then invoke appropriate prognostic routines for assessment of remaining life and capability. Thus, QSI's Testability Engineering And Maintenance System (TEAMS) real-time reasoner will enable the use of many existing prognostics techniques in the broader context by decomposing the complex system into local datasets of degradations and associated sensor data sets, thereby limiting the problem-space for the prognostic techniques to their limited design scope. Indeed, it is well established in the contexts of parameter estimation and model-based fault identification (i.e., fault isolation and severity estimation) that feature selection and diagnosis, respectively, followed by parameter estimation provides major improvements in estimation performance (measured in terms of computational time as well as the standard deviations of the estimated parameters) when compared to full parameter estimation which provides biased estimates for all the parameters.* [Devices and Methods for Collection and Concentration of Air and Surface Samples for Improved Detection of Microbes onboard ISS, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/feqn-euex) - Protecting the International Space Station (ISS) crew from microbial contaminants is of great importance.  Bacterial and fungal contamination of air, surfaces and water aboard ISS has the potential to cause sickness among ISS crew and to impact onboard experiments.  Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments.  These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, creates a significant need for a rapid way to determine when microbial contamination events occur.  To this end, InnovaPrep LLC of Drexel, MO proposes development of improved methods for collection of microbes from air and surfaces for delivery into a small liquid volume compatible with advanced molecular based detection systems.
 Rapid microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour.  Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample collection and concentration techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in the environment.  In the proposed Phase I work, InnovaPrep will leverage current aerosol and surface collection and elution technologies and innovations from a 2015 NASA awarded SBIR for microbial concentration from ISS potable water, for handling of these technologies in a microgravity environment, to develop novel ISS aerosol and surface collection systems.  Specifically, InnovaPrep will develop new, optimized aerosol filter assemblies and surface sampling assemblies that allow for collection from larger air volumes and surface areas and elution into smaller liquid volumes than is currently possible.* [Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution](https://data.nasa.gov/d/27uc-hxhn) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI)

Currently, NASA uses different sensing technologies such as Pyrolysis&#150;GCMS to analyze planetary samples. These instruments require complex sample handling and can process only a limited number of samples.  It is critical to develop an effective instrument with extended and enhanced capabilities to enable future planetary multiple-mission needs. We propose to develop a novel nonlinear Raman spectral sensing instrument for trace organic detection at the sub ppm level based on fluoresence-free surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).  The proposed instrument will be capable of detecting the molecular signatures in Martian samples in the field with significantly improved sensitivity (>100,000,000) and reduced noise (>100).  It will offer NASA a ultra sensitive deployable instrument suitable for robotic missions in terms of in situ measurements, resolution, bandwidth, compact size, low cost, and ruggedness.  The detection of organics at the sub ppm level in Martian-like soils will be applicable to several future NASA missions, in particular future rovers for the upcoming Mars 2020 mission.   These mobile, fast and agile rovers are focused on collection for sample return and require non-sampling analytical instruments.* [Multipurpose Bottlebrush Polymers for Health Care](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uze9-qehc) - Multipurpose Bottlebrush Polymers for Health Care* [Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution](https://data.nasa.gov/d/avg2-kcf8) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI)

Additionally, an instrument suite is required to perform the complicated task of autonomous life detection. We propose to address these technological and operational requirements for ocean world access with THOR, a robust cryobot capable of rapid (10 m/hr), deep (500+ m) subglacial access that carries an onboard science payload optimized for environmental characterization and life detection. THOR will be deployed at the eastern Skaftafell subglacial lake in Vatnajokull, Iceland where it will penetrate the thick ice cover of the lake. Successful fielding of THOR will mark the first cryobot descent into a subglacial lake, thus enabling unique investigations of both the lake's geomicrobiology and of CONOPS strategies for a cryobot's entry into, and descent through, a subglacial body of water. The THOR team leverages successful work from the VALKYRIE and SPINDLE projects and offers fidelity to PSTAR in the areas of Science, Science Operations, and Technology. a) Science: Investigations of the eastern Skaftafell lake will center around detecting and characterizing microorganisms in the water column and volcanic vents to decipher the contribution of chemical energy liberated from geothermal vs. glaciological processes. To aid these investigations, THOR will carry a suite of instruments chosen to characterize the environment of the ice and subglacial lake, with a specific focus on life-detection strategies. Onboard instruments will include a fluorescence spectrometer, a holographic microscope capable of imaging prokaryotic cells, an inorganic chemistry measurement suite, a transmissometer / backscattering sensor, and a water sampler. A nanopore DNA sequencer will be used on-site to analyze water samples acquired by THOR. Comparative analysis will utilize water column and vent material samples, which will be returned to the surface and analyzed. b) Science Operations: At Skaftafell the THOR cryobot will penetrate a 300 m thick glacier and enter the subglacial lake in the volcano's crater. Upon reaching the ice-water interface, the cryobot will transition into an instrument sonde and spool itself to the lake floor while sampling and analyzing the water column. This penetrator-to-sonde strategy is a new step-wise approach to the initial exploration of an alien ocean. As the vehicle descends input from the sensor suite will govern decision-to-collect behaviors to trigger processes such as water sampling. The system will be retrieved after each mission and we anticipate completing several descents in each of two field seasons. Exploring methods which could be used to detect extant life on ocean worlds is of high importance. To that end, we will assess how well and in what ways the suite of instruments function together to determine whether life is present and at what quantities. Conventional limnological and microbiological techniques using water samples acquired by THOR will be used to evaluate autonomous sampling decisions. c) Technology: The cryobot design will use a closed-cycle hot water drill approach wherein the water is heated in a novel way: high voltage is applied across a flowing column of water, which serves as the resistive element in an electro-resistive heater. Energy transfer from the electrical source to the water is instantaneous and occurs at 100% efficiency. Direct high voltage heating, combined with new insulation technology, makes possible a compact cryobot that is capable of rapid descent and deep subglacial access with a small field-logistics footprint. Given its simplicity, the cryobot will be inexpensive, easily deployable, and field serviceable. The THOR platform will enable unprecedented access to subglacial environments, making it an ideal payload delivery system for ocean worlds technology development and analog research in this PSTAR project and beyond.* [Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/dwtt-u9i5) - Global Multihazard Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles is a 2.5 minute grid of global multihazard 

total economic loss risks. First, for each of the considered hazards (cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and 

volcanoes), subnational distributions of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are computed using a methodology developed from Sachs et al. 

(2003). Where applicable, the contributions of subnational units to national GDP estimates, the contribution ratio, are determined 

using data of varied origin. World Bank Development Indicators are substituted for GDP estimates of varied origin and the subnational 

GDP is estimated using the fore mentioned contribution ratios. A subnational, per capita GDP is derived and a final GDP estimate per 

grid cell is made based on grid cell population density. A raw, total economic loss is computed per grid cell using a regional 

economic loss rate derived from EM-DAT records. To more accurately reflect the confidence surrounding the economic loss estimate, the 

range of losses are classified into deciles, 10 classes of an approximately equal number of grid cells. A multihazard index is 

generated by summing the top three deciles of the individual hazards. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia

Specifically, engine developers are in need of a manufacturing technology that is capable of generating cooling channels in liquid rocket nozzles and combustion chambers at low cost, while supporting increasingly complex designs (see appended letter of support from Aerojet Rocketdyne).

This Phase II project will result in a reduced cost flexible technology that is ready to support the development and fabrication of advanced channel wall rocket liners and combustors.

This will be achieved by adapting a novel manufacturing technology that can machine delicate and complex features in metals and ceramics.  This technology was demonstrated to be feasible to support the advancement of channel rocket design by making more complex designs manufacturable while reducing lead time and manufacturing cost.

It was shown to reduce machine time by 90% when compared to milling the same cooling channels in stainless steel.  Advancing engine performance can be achieved through more optimal combustor and liner cooling, however engine designers are currently limited in what can be designed due to current technology slitting saw or end mill capabilities.  The proposed technology overcomes this limitation and supports the design and fabrication of highly complex and delicate features.  It can easily be scaled up to support SSME class engines.
 
At the end of Phase II, this technology will be ready to support the development of and production of channel wall rockets that incorporate more complex cooling features than are currently feasible to manufacture.  The technology will made more user friendly and efficient to implement, and a manufacturing workstation layout and cost will be developed to support both small and SSME class engines.* [Thin and Automated Blanket Lamination and Encapsulation Systems (TABLES), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yrbt-4fwf) - Flexible photovoltaic array technologies require very thin and precisely controlled deposition of the polymeric films used to fabricate them. In most flexible blanket architectures, optically transparent silicones are utilized in the fabrication of the arrays, however due to their rheology and processing conditions there are limitations to how thin they can be applied. In this proposal, Vanguard proposes Thin and Automated Blanket Lamination and Encapsulation Systems (TABLES) that utilize automated drawdown methods and rheology control to render flexible blankets approaching 700 W/kg and only 13 mils thick (including cells). Further, the TABLES concept is easily adapted to a number of substrates and superstrates, rendering "LEO to GEO" packaging and automation simply through appropriate substrate choice.* [Novel, Functionally Graded Coating System for Reusable, Very High Temperature Applications, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/v97k-iyv3) - There is a clear need to advance the state-of-the-art carbon-carbon coated Nozzle Extensions (NE) beyond the engine/mission performance currently established by Herakles technology, which is intrinsically limited to about 3000 F. The well-established SiC-based (CVD, pack cementation) technologies currently available also have upper temperature limits around 3000 F, imposing stringent limitations on increased performance and system level changes (i.e. hotter propellant) for future NASA missions. In addition, the intrinsic CTE mismatch between C-C substrate and refractory carbides/oxides further limits the use of many other classical coating technologies. The successful Phase I results established the feasibility of overcoming these limitations through the use of a novel, functionally graded (FGM) coating technology. The proposed Phase II builds on the success of the Phase I program and clearly increases its TRL by offering subscale component testing at representative engine conditions. A successful Phase II program will clearly offer a new dimension in the nozzle extensions by offering different coating systems for multi-cycle capability at temperatures from 3000 F up to 4000 F.  The expected ability of the coating to survive such an aggressive testing combined with the sufficient retention of mechanical properties offers a direct path for a Phase III with many of the commercial space payload companies. The overall approach is based upon a multi-piece C-C NE concept, which focuses the requirements for high temperature oxidation protection to smaller diameters of the nozzle extension (e.g. A cone), allowing the CVD coating technology to remain within current SOTA CVD capabilities. Larger diameter segments, which are exposed to lower temperatures, will utilize non-CVD lower cost technology which is well suited for large diameter components. The direct benefit to NASA is undisputed with direct applicability to several planned future missions, including the very challeng* [Logistics Reduction: Advanced Clothing System (ACS)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/vh37-7kcv) - <p>The goal of the Advanced Exploration System (AES) Logistics Reduction&nbsp;(LR) project&#39;s Advanced Clothing System (ACS) is to use advanced commercial off-the-shelf fibers (COTS) and antimicrobial treatments to directly reduce the mass and volume of astronaut clothing. The textile industry has made significant progress with new fiber blends and garment finishing. The ACS team is leveraging existing state-of-the-art technology from private industry to make advancements in the crew wardrobe.&nbsp; There is not a clear measure of how the newer fibers contribute to longer wear in a microgravity shirt sleeve environment.&nbsp; The ACS provides a means of comparing varying fabrics through a series of controlled conditions.</p><p>The current clothing state-of-the-art on the International Space Station (ISS) is disposable, mostly cotton-based, clothing with no laundry provisions. Each clothing article has varying use&nbsp;periods and will become trash. The goal is to increase the length of wear of the clothing to reduce the logistical mass and volume.</p><p>The ACS technology is a continuation from the Logistics Reduction and Repurposing project. The initial focus was exercise clothing and routine wear tops since the use period is shorter. A ground-based experiment was conducted to evaluate current and lighter weight COTS&nbsp;exercise clothing and antimicrobial treatments to investigate if they could be used for longer periods of time. The best performers were selected for an&nbsp;experiment on the International Space Station (ISS) - Intravehicular Activity (IVA) Clothing Study. The experiment was conducted during ISS increments 39 through 41 with six crew&nbsp;members. A laundry trade-off study was conducted to quantify how longer-wear clothing changes the break-even point for laundering vs. clothing disposal. The analysis indicates that use of ACS selected garments (e.g. wool, modacrylic, polyester) can increase the breakeven point for laundry to about 300 days. ACS studies also investigated lint reduction and microbial behavior on textiles.&nbsp; The ACS task also investigated&nbsp;the subtasks of alternative laundry and clothing sanitation technologies in FY16 and FY17.&nbsp; In FY18, internal NASA technology testing will allow down select of technologies that will then notionally begin development in FY19 in parallel with new SBIR/STTR requests in key areas.</p><p>Several SBIR companies have investigated coatings to improve wear and laundering of clothing over the ACS time period.</p>* [Fault Adaptive Control of Overactuated Systems Using Prognostic Estimation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mq9r-yg32) - Most fault adaptive control research addresses the preservation of system stability or functionality in the presence of a specific failure (fault). This paper examines the fault adaptive control problem for a generic class of incipient failure modes, which do not initially affect system stability, but will eventually cause a catastrophic failure to occur. This risk of catastrophic failure due a component fault mode is some monotonically increasing function of the load on the component. Assuming that a probabilistic prognostic model is available to evaluate the risk of incipient fault modes growing into catastrophic failure conditions, then fundamentally the fault adaptive control problem is to adjust component
loads to minimize risk of failure, while not overly degrading nominal performance. A methodology is proposed for posing this problem as a finite horizon constrained optimization, where constraints correspond to maximum risk of failure and maximum deviation from nominal performance. Development of the methodology to handle a general class of overactuated systems is given. Also, the fault adaptive control methodology is demonstrated on an application example of practical significance, an electro-mechanical actuator (EMA) consisting of three DC motors geared to the same output shaft. Similar actuator systems are commonly used in aerospace, transportation, and industrial processes to actuate critical loads, such as aircraft control surfaces. The fault mode simulated in the system is a temperature dependent motor winding insulation degradation.* [Prognostic Health-Management System Development for Electromechanical Actuators](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7prv-6yvh) - Electro-mechanical actuators (EMAs) have been gaining increased acceptance as safety-critical actuation devices in the next generation of aircraft and spacecraft.  The aerospace manufacturers are not ready, however, to completely embrace EMAs for all applications due to apprehension with regard to some of the more critical fault modes.  This work aims to help address these concerns by developing and testing a prognostic health management system that diagnoses EMA faults and employs prognostic algorithms to track fault progression and predict the actuator remaining useful life. The diagnostic algorithm is implemented using a combined model-based and data-driven reasoner. The prognostic algorithm, implemented using Gaussian Process Regression, estimates the remaining life of the faulted component. The paper also covers the selection of fault modes for coverage and methods developed for fault injection. Validation experiments were conducted both in laboratory and flight conditions using the Flyable Electromechanical Actuator (FLEA) test stand. The FLEA allows test actuators to be subjected to realistic environmental and operating conditions, while providing the capability to safely inject and monitor propagation of various fault modes. The paper covers both diagnostic and prognostic, run-to-failure experiments, conducted in laboratory and flight conditions for several types of faults. The experiments demonstrated robust fault diagnosis on the selected set of component and sensor faults and high-accuracy predictions of failure time in prognostic scenarios.* [Developing, Maintaining, and Restoring Team Cohesion](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uhe2-dj9w) - Team cohesion, as an important team process factor, has been researched in the psychological literature for well over 50 years. Several meta-analytic investigations have firmly established its contribution to team effectiveness (Beal, Cohen, Burke, & McLendon, 2003; Gully, Devine, & Whitney, 1995; Mullen & Copper, 1994), particularly for teams performing complex, interdependent tasks. Team cohesion is primarily viewed as a motivational team process that captures the interpersonal attraction of team members to each other (social cohesion) and the commitment of members to the team mission (task cohesion). Although task cohesion is more strongly related to team performance, both factors are important because problems with social cohesion can “spill over” to undermine task cohesion, other relevant team processes, and team performance (Kozlowski & Ilgen, 2006). Thus, the capability to intervene to enhance the development, maintenance, and restoration of team cohesion for flight crews and ground control teams is essential to the overall mission effectiveness for the NASA strategic plan for space exploration (NASA, 2008).     <p></p>
Team cohesion, good collaboration, and psychosocial health are essential ingredients for effective “high reliability” action teams that perform critical tasks in isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environments, such as teams of astronauts. Although a substantial amount of research has established a relationship between team cohesion and team effectiveness, very little research examines how teams collaborate and maintain cohesion, effective teamwork, and psychosocial health over time. That is, the vast majority of the research is based on static, cross-sectional data. There is simply very little research examining team cohesion and team functioning over short, medium, and long duration missions. Thus, basic research to examine team interaction dynamics is needed to develop effective and obtrusive assessment methods, monitoring technologies, and team regulation tools and techniques to enable crew members and mission controllers to maintain, sustain, and adapt team collaboration to achieve team effectiveness. That is the focus of this research effort.    <p></p>
This ground-based research focused on three primary areas of activity:    <p></p>
1.	We worked to gain access to NASA analog environments with the goal of benchmarking team cohesion variability and fluctuations for teams operating under ICE conditions.     <p></p>
•	Establishing normative benchmarks for team interaction and function is critical to (later) being able to detect anomalies that necessitate countermeasures.      <p></p>
2.	We developed and prototyped a technology platform (i.e., a wireless sensor system) to provide an unobtrusive measurement system for monitoring team interactions and assessing psychosocial health.     <p></p>
•	Real time cohesion and collaboration assessment will be critical to monitoring team effectiveness and triggering countermeasures.    <p></p>
3.	We prototyped the use of behavioral metrics to assess team cohesion, which is a critical first step for establishing the utility of the monitoring technology, and initiated a phased validation process to demonstrate the potential of the monitoring technology and measurement system.     <p></p>
•	It is essential that the technology system provides reliable, valid, and useful metrics for assessing the nature and quality of team interactions. <p></p>* [Propulsion Health Monitoring of a Turbine Engine Disk using Spin Test Data](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9cg3-upqa) - On line detection techniques to monitor the health of rotating engine components are becoming increasingly attractive options to aircraft engine companies in order to increase safety of operation and lower maintenance costs. Health monitoring remains a challenging feature to easily implement, especially, in the presence of scattered loading conditions, crack size, component geometry and materials properties. The current trend, however, is to utilize noninvasive types of health monitoring or nondestructive techniques to detect hidden flaws and mini cracks before any catastrophic event occurs. These techniques go further to evaluate materials' discontinuities and other anomalies that have grown to the level of critical defects which can lead to failure. Generally, health monitoring is highly dependent on sensor systems that are capable of performing in various engine environmental conditions and able to transmit a signal upon a predetermined crack length, while acting in a neutral form upon the overall performance of the engine system. Efforts are under way at NASA Glenn Research Center through support of the Intelligent Vehicle Health Management Project (IVHM) to develop and implement such sensor technology for a wide variety of applications [1-5]. These efforts are focused on developing high temperature, wireless, low cost and durable products.Therefore, in an effort to address the technical issues concerning health monitoring of a rotor disk, this paper considers data collected from an experimental study using high frequency capacitive sensor technology to capture blade tip clearance and tip timing measurements in a rotating engine-like-disk-to predict the disk faults and assess its structural integrity. The experimental results collected at a range of rotational speeds from tests conducted at the NASA Glenn Research Center's Rotordynamics Laboratory will be evaluated using multiple data-driven anomaly detection techniques [6-9] to identify anomalies in the disk. This study is expected to present a select evaluation of online health monitoring of a rotating disk using these high caliber sensors and test the capability of the in-house spin system.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Climate and Land Cover](https://data.nasa.gov/d/w2sg-brem) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Climate and Land Cover provides data and information on global gridded climatological variables, global land cover maps, and national and international protected areas. The climatological data include the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) monthly terrestrial surface temperature and precipitation grids at 0.5 degree resolution from 1901-1996, along with temperature and precipitation grids at 10-minute resolution from the CRU and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). The Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000) was produced by an international partnership of 30 research groups coordinated by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which contained two levels of land cover information; detailed and regionally optimized land cover for each continent, and a less thematically detailed global land cover that harmonizes regions into one consistent product. The maps were based on daily data from the Vegetation 1 sensor on-board SPOT 4, though mapping of regions required the use of data from additional Earth observing sensors to resolve specific issues. The international and national protected areas were generated from the World Database of Protected Areas for the year 2000.* [Space Weather in Operation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/usry-vycb) - <p>The &ldquo;Space Weather in Operations&rdquo; effort will provide on-demand and near-real time space weather event information to the Data Access Toolkit (DAT), which is the next generation trending system for NASA missions.&nbsp; The types of space weather events that will be identified and made available in the system include solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and solar energetic particles.</p><p>It is imperative that Mission Operations Teams (MOTs) have access to information that is pertinent to the safety of their satellites.&nbsp; Space environment information, particularly phenomena that is elevated to the level of &quot;event&quot; status, is information that should be readily available to all MOTs - allowing them to be better equipped to protect NASA assets in space.</p> <p>This activity will leverage existing GSFC capabilities and data sets, with space weather event information primarily coming from the Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) system.&nbsp; DONKI currently captures all space weather events that are observed and analyzed by the forecasters at the Space Weather Research Center (SWRC) at GSFC.&nbsp; Once a standardized interface and pipeline has been clearly defined and implemented, the DAT trending system can request and ingest SW event information from DONKI in near real-time - subsequently making such information readily available to the MOT.&nbsp; The DONKI system would also be able to request and ingest potential spacecraft anomaly events, or general spacecraft events of interest, from the DAT trending system.&nbsp; These spacecraft events would help the CCMC/SWRC team correlate and investigate the effects of space weather on various spacecraft under specific circumstances.</p>* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios](https://data.nasa.gov/d/43y3-n5qx) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Scenarios provide useful insight into the complex factors that drive ecosystem change, estimating the magnitude   of regional pressures on ecosystems and critical uncertainties that could undermine sustainable development. They also provide an understanding of the importance of institutions and values   as the long-range outlook for the world's ecosystems depends on the course taken by global and regional development in the coming decades. The integration of changing ecosystem conditions   into the global scenarios was taken as both effects and causes. The MA scenarios include those for population, income, cereal production and consumption, meat production and consumption,   land cover, waster stress, water availability, acidification and nitrogen deposition.* [SpaceDoc-Intelligent Health Management System for Astronauts, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7e7b-q98g) - Crew health and performance are critical to successful space explorations. However, long duration missions present numerous risks to crew health and performance. Human exploration missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO) will present additional challenges. These missions will require technology solutions for crew health care to address physiological, psychological, performance, and other needs in-situ, e.g., self-sufficiency, since real-time medical support from the earth, and emergency evacuation will not be available. Onboard personal health-tracking tools for health monitoring, health risk assessment and management will be needed for the crews in order to predict his/her future health conditions. Therefore, missions beyond LEO will require a new generation of capabilities and systems, which will be built upon existing capabilities and incorporate technologies yet to be developed. Lynntech proposes image-based photoplethysmography, in combination with, smart machine-learning algorithms which will primarily utilize onboard high-quality video cameras. The proposed system will: (1) constantly monitor vital physiological signs data, (2) ensure their acceptability,  (3) identify their unusual or abnormal patterns, (4) perform diagnosis and prognosis, as well as, (5) provide necessary risk mitigation and medical intervention options to maintain crew performance optimal and sustained throughout the mission.* [Vibration reduction methods and techniques for rotorcraft utilizing on-blade active control, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/c426-qp8p) - Rotor blades adapted for vibration control have the added benefit of extended blade and rotor life, as well as improved passenger comfort.  Approaches that have been explored for on-blade active control or individual blade control include control surface actuation, such as trailing edge flaps, and integrated blade manipulation, such as controllable twist.  For retro-fit and upgrade purposes, the advanced rotor system needs an actuation scheme with appropriate force, deflection, and bandwidth, without detrimentally increasing on-blade mass.  Research in this area has been conducted with potential solutions employing various conventional active material actuator configurations, but these systems have typically suffered from inherent disadvantages.  Due to these limitations, Techno-Sciences, Inc. proposes the use of pneumatic artificial muscles to actuate a trailing edge flap device for management of rotorcraft vibration.  The proposed actuators are constructed of passive materials that are very mass efficient and low cost, while maintaining adequate force, stroke, and bandwidth.  Oriented along the blade span and located within the airfoil contour near the blade root, the antagonistic configuration of actuators offers bi-directional flap deflection and operation under a low centrifugal field.  A lightweight mechanism accompanies the actuators, running along the span, to transfer and tailor the mechanical work from the actuators to the span station of the flap.  The proposed research plan will work to properly size and scale the actuators and mechanism for the desired response, and construct a prototype device that demonstrates the feasibility of the concept on the bench-top and in a rotating environment at full-scale loading.* [Expandable Variable-Autonomy Architecture Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2g54-kk4v) - &lt;p&gt;Effective multi-level autonomous piloting systems require integration with safety-critical functions. The Expandable Variable-Autonomy Architecture&amp;nbsp;(EVAA)&amp;nbsp;project seeks to develop a hierarchal autonomous system framework that will depend on deterministic systems with higher authority to protect against catastrophic piloting faults and allow a lower level certification for the machine learning sub-systems. The multi-layered approach provides the framework for analytical systems that can learn, predict, and adapt to both routine and emergency situations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of the project is to develop an autonomous piloting system based on analytical and learning algorithms that are capable of making effective decisions, in both nominal and potentially catastrophic situations. This will develop a safety critical framework for certification of complex autonomous systems where a small but sufficient number of levels. The system will be integrated with a certified safety critical decision makers (such as vehicle health monitoring, collision avoidance, loss of control avoidance and restricts commands of higher level critical decision makers not certified to level A software. The project will integrate these systems onto a quad-rotor micro-UAV for inexpensive and quick flight testing of concepts and develop customized, low power hardware to house the control and decision making algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS: The purpose of this CIF project is not to develop a full scale aircraft capable of these types of advancements, but only to develop a piloting system which make them possible. Initially, decisions associated with &amp;ldquo;where to fly&amp;rdquo; will be focused on and integrated into the algorithms. For this slice of the pie, the system will be required to navigate a potentially changing dense urban landscape. Routes will be planned based on time, distance, and potential risk. Additionally, terrain and obstacle avoidance algorithms will restrict these activities based on preloaded obstacle and terrain maps. Additionally, off nominal conditions such as loss of motor or other non-pre-programmed events will cause the aircraft to select landing or crashing locations based on population density maps, location of buildings, and other information. A hangar or small area will be turned into the urban city-center mockup with maps created of the mockup to facilitate flight test of concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work to date: &lt;/strong&gt;The hierarchical decision chain and framework, hardware, and embedded processing related to ground collision avoidance is in place for a sub-scale platform. Flight tests on a quad-rotor model helicopter demonstrated successful limitation of flight decisions when facing imminent ground collision.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead: &lt;/strong&gt;The team is developing a full set of safety-critical functions for the sub-scale platforms and working to scale up to larger UAVs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partners: &lt;/strong&gt;University of California at Berkeley and Stanford University are developing algorithms, and the FAA is participating in the certification process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increases safety: &lt;/strong&gt;Integration of safety-critical functions improves outcomes in emergency situations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifiable: &lt;/strong&gt;Removal of safety-critical functions from the autonomous control enables adaptable processes to be certified to a lower level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UAVs and unmanned submersibles&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Autonomous rail transport&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep space exploration&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&g* [STARwatch to Deliver Objective Sleep Measures for Spaceflight Operations, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/n4f8-ybhu) - This project will achieve a wrist-worn actigraphy device called STARwatch, designed specifically for space exploration environments. It will provide a minimally obtrusive, objective measure that evaluates astronaut sleep-wake activity and light exposure. This project will leverage our second-generation actigraphy device that has already been validated in controlled laboratory experiments against gold-standard polysomnography. The compact wrist-worn device includes sensors to collect sleep metrics and will also serve as a wireless hub to collect real-time physiological data from other body-worn sensors (e.g., heart rate, EEG). It will use standardized wireless communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth) to automatically uplink data to the ISS network (no astronaut time required). Data will automatically be integrated into medical operations support systems adhering to NASA data requirements (e.g., HL7), providing immediate feedback to astronauts and flight surgeons to aid in decision-making relative to astronaut medical, behavioral health and performance issues. During Phase II, we will conduct user testing and validation in a space flight analog environment, complete product refinements, and certify STARwatch for spaceflight. (Phase II TRL of 7-8).* [Transparent and Flexible Electrodynamic Coating for Particulate Removal, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xb2w-s53v) - NASA has an unmet need for clean, dust-free surfaces critical for many mission applications: solar panels and collectors, aircraft components, optical windows, photographic equipment, and flight suits. However, dust mitigation and removal remains a difficult task, particularly given the nature and morphology of space-born particulate materials and the strong bonds they can develop with any surface. Several mechanical techniques involving shaking and wiping have been devised to address this problem, but these are difficult to implement and expensive to maintain over mission life cycles.
One successful innovation that has been developed and tested for dust removal is the "electrodynamic shield" or EDS. The EDS is composed of inter-digitated, electrically conductive electrodes connected to an AC power supply. The main parameters that govern the efficiency of dust removal are the voltage and the frequency of the AC signal applied to the electrodes. Poly Adaptive, LLC, proposes to investigate the novel application and use of nanoscale materials to address severe limitations of existing EDS designs caused by the metallic electrodes that reduce the amount of radiation reaching solar panels. Successful Phase I results will show the feasibility of an EDS that is transparent and can be placed on top of any surface.* [Revolutionize Propulsion Test Facility High-Speed Video Imaging with Disruptive Computational Photography Enabling Technology](https://data.nasa.gov/d/cw7k-fj8c) - <p>Advanced rocket propulsion testing requires high-speed video recording that can capture essential information for NASA during rocket engine flight certification ground testing. While it is important to assess all anomalies during testing, this is particularly true in the event of a mishap. The video recording in use today at NASA&rsquo;s Stennis Space Center (SSC) is significantly outdated and in need of the revolutionary approach being proposed. The current system has poor resolution and records to VHS tapes that are no longer commercially available. The system has been partially upgraded by incorporating consumer grade digital cameras, but these cameras have significant limitations including plume saturation and on-board memory storage, which make it nearly impossible, in catastrophic situations that result in the loss of a camera, to obtain critical information. This project will design and build a state-of-the-art high-speed video recording system using disruptive technologies based on emerging advances made in the field of computational photography. This system will not only provide quality, high-speed, 3-D high dynamic range video to the SSC engine test complex, but the technologies developed will be extendable to other NASA priorities including launch monitoring and space-based rover and robotics missions.&nbsp;</p><p>This project will design and build a novel state-of-the-art high-speed video recording system to provide 3-D High Dynamic Range (HDR) video imagery for operational use on the SSC engine test stands. The system will leverage newly emerging algorithms being developed within the computational photography discipline. Computational photography expands digital photography by applying computational image capture, processing, and manipulation techniques to improve image quality. HDR imaging effectively increases a camera&rsquo;s dynamic range and eliminates saturation. Juxtaposed with current imaging techniques, which often utilize either multiple cameras or a single camera with multiple exposure sequencing, the transformative approach will be implemented at the chip level using a single camera, which significantly reduces cost and implementation complexities. Three such cameras will provide multiple viewing, enabling high-speed 3-D HDR imagery, important for a more robust analysis.</p>* [Aircraft Structural Analysis, Design Optimization, and Manufacturing Tool Integration, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/96q4-h7iu) - Innovative research is proposed in integrating fundamental aircraft design processes with an emphasis on composite structures. Efficient, lightweight composite laminate structural design requires highly integrated structural analyses on the laminate and stiffened panel levels, while incorporating manufacturing processes and limitations. Laminate optimization is only one of the many design variables that need to be considered simultaneously in aircraft design. Yet true system level OML surface optimization is an extremely challenging problem that can only be made tractable by reducing the problem into three sequential gates: ply count compatibility, layup sequencing, and ply layout size and shape. The innovative approach proposed solves all three of these seemingly intractable gates and in so doing provides synergistic optimization of ply drops and adds and reduced manufacturing ply processing steps (drawing part numbers) along with laminate sizing to damage tolerance material allowables. To achieve the highest level of design fidelity requires iterative communication with the designer's CAD tool and ply zone mapping tools. Previous data exchange technology used by NASA to couple separate discipline design tools is the XML ASCII file format. Proposed is the evaluation and implementation of a binary format called 'HDF5'.* [Rapid Concentration for Improved Detection of Microbes in ISS Potable Water, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bked-xvzq) - Providing a reliable supply of safe drinking water is a critical requirement for space exploration. Systems that provide recycled treated water aboard the International Space Station, and that will supply water aboard future spacecraft, are inherently complex and can be susceptible to biofilm formation and microbial contamination. Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments. These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, make rapid, reliable methods of detecting microbes at low levels a critical need. Rapid microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour. Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample concentration and preparation techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in drinking water. Currently, without sample concentration, rapid detection techniques alone produce results that are hundreds to thousands of times less sensitive than the minimum desired detection limit for microbial water contaminants. InnovaPrep proposes development of a rapid microbial concentration system designed for use aboard the International Space Station. The system will concentrate microbes from up to 5 Liters of potable water into volumes as small as 200 uL, providing concentration factors as high as 15,000X. It will be based on technologies developed and commercialized by InnovaPrep, but will contain innovations to allow for operation in microgravity. Large volumes of potable water are processed through a hollow fiber membrane filter concentration cell as microbes are captured within the lumen of the fibers. Following capture, the microbes are efficiently eluted using a novel Wet Foam Elution process and then delivered to a rapid detection system for analysis.* [Structural Health Monitoring with Fiber Bragg Grating and Piezo Arrays, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kkxz-fuu2) - IFOS and its research institute collaborator, Washington State University (WSU), have demonstrated feasibility of a structural health monitoring (SHM) system for aerospace vehicles such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or commercial airliners. In Phase 1, a unique high-speed, high-channel count fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor interrogation system enabling a new Lamb wave-based damage detection method was demonstrated. This SHM system allows accurate detection of damage in rectangular composite plates simultaneously collected from a plurality of strategically placed FBG sensors using  relatively few piezo actuators. Utilization of structurally integrated, distributed sensors to monitor the health of a structure allows for high-speed collection and interpretation of sensor signals, coupled with real-time data processing. The proposed system provides automated diagnosis and prognosis capabilities, greatly reducing the overall inspection burden. Phase 2 is designed to advance the technology towards specific NASA flight research testbed platforms, particularly Ikhana. During Phase 2, IFOS will collaborate with prime system contractors to address challenges and risks associated with the intended operational environment, including (a) generation of a complete flight worthy design, (b) performance enhancement and ruggedization of the interrogator and sensors, (c) optimization of damage detection algorithms and their implementation, and (d) total system performance validation and evaluation.* [Probabilistic Delamination Diagnosis of Composite Materials Using a Novel Bayesian Imaging Method](https://data.nasa.gov/d/nztd-2nue) - In this paper, a probabilistic delamination location and size detection framework is proposed. The delamination probability image using Lamb wave-based damage detection is constructed using the Bayesian updating technique. First, the algorithm for the probabilistic delamination detection framework using Bayesian updating (Bayesian Imaging Method - BIM) is proposed. Following this, the composite coupon fatigue testing setup is introduced and the corresponding lamb wave diagnosis signal is collected and interpreted. Next, the obtained signal features are incorporated in the Bayesian Imaging Method to detect delamination size and location, as well as their confidence bounds. The damage detection results using the proposed methodology are compared with X-ray images for verification and validation. Finally, some conclusions and future works are drawn based on the proposed study.* [Compact Sensor for Isotope and Trace Gas Analysis, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ddt5-icwp) - We propose to develop and demonstrate a new sensor platform for isotope and trace-gas analysis that is appropriate for future planetary missions.  Among other applications, the technology can enable the collection of isotope ratio data in support of the search for evidence of life within the solar system.  Current limitations to in-situ isotope measurements will be overcome by utilizing a capillary absorption spectrometer (CAS).  This concept enables high precision measurements within the ultra-small volume (~ 0.1 ml) of a hollow fiber optic capillary and has proven to be three orders of magnitude more sensitive than competing sensors.  The proposed effort focuses on transitioning the current lab-based technique to a small size, weight, and power (SWaP) device that can be operated unattended.  In Phase I, proposed concepts for improving the system performance, reducing the SWaP, and engineering a field-capable device were proven and specific options down selected.  Under Phase II, we will fully develop a general prototype sensor platform, which is applicable to a wide range of isotope ratio and trace-gas analysis applications.  Specific examples of the utility and versatility of the concept will be demonstrated by using the system as a stand-alone gas sensor, as well as in combination with both a laser ablation sampler and a gas chromatograph.  In addition, a dual laser system will be developed to measure both Carbon (C) and Sulfur (S) isotope ratios.  The sensitivity afforded by the proposed system would open up remote analysis of smaller samples than ever before measured, which could be a significant development in the search for biosignatures on other planets and near space objects, as well as in the early Earth rock record.* [PROBABILITY CALIBRATION BY THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PROBABILITY SCORES IN ONE-CLASS BAYES LEARNING FOR ANOMALY DETECTION](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2mm5-p3cz) - PROBABILITY CALIBRATION BY THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PROBABILITY
SCORES IN ONE-CLASS BAYES LEARNING FOR ANOMALY DETECTION

GUICHONG LI, NATHALIE JAPKOWICZ, IAN HOFFMAN, R. KURT UNGAR

ABSTRACT. One-class Bayes learning such as one-class Naïve Bayes and one-class Bayesian
Network employs Bayes learning to build a classifier on the positive class only for discriminating
the positive class and the negative class. It has been applied to anomaly detection for identifying
abnormal behaviors that deviate from normal behaviors. Because one-class Bayes classifiers can
produce probability score, which can be used for defining anomaly score for anomaly detection,
they are preferable in many practical applications as compared with other one-class learning
techniques. However, previously proposed one-class Bayes classifiers might suffer from poor
probability estimation when the negative training examples are unavailable. In this paper, we
propose a new method to improve the probability estimation. The improved one-class Bayes
classifiers can exhibits high performance as compared with previously proposed one-class Bayes
classifiers according to our empirical results.* [High Efficiency Solar Cell on Low Cost Metal Foil Substrate, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/527n-8nui) - Future space missions will require Solar cell arrays having specific power ratings in excess of 1000 W/kg. Conventional crystalline photovoltaic technology comprised of epitaxial photovoltaic semiconductor materials grown on single crystal semiconductor substrates, cannot provide these specific ratings. We propose to synthesize nano-precursors of solar cell materials of uniform size by Solvo-thermal process. These nano-precursors will be deposited as nano-thin film on low cot and flexible metal foil substrate by Electrophoretic technique. Through subsequent , insitu annealing, thin films with grain size >50 microns will be produced. GaAs, Ge and InP will be investigated to determine which material can be deposited as high quality large grain thin film without contamination. The synthesized nano-precursors, electrphoretically deposited nano-thin film and large grain thin film produced after annealing will be fully characterized. A combination of crystalline thin film photovoltaic layers having an efficiency of just 25% fabricated on low cost, light weight flexible substrate such as a metal foil, would yield a specific power rating of >1200 W/kg. During Phase II multi-junction solar cell will be grown on the large grain thin film produced during Phase I on flexible/low cost metal foil substrate.* [Further Development of Aperture: A Precise Extremely large Reflective Telescope Using Re-configurable Elements](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4nx6-jgdh) - One of the pressing needs for space ultraviolet-visible astronomy is a design to allow larger mirrors than the James Webb Space Telescope primary. The diameter of the rocket fairing limits the mirror diameter such that all future missions calling for mirrors up to 16 m in diameter or larger will require a mirror that is deployed post-launch. In response to the deployment requirement, we address the issues of this concept called "A Precise Extremely large Reflective Telescope Using Reconfigurable Elements (APERTURE) with both hardware experiments and software simulations. APERTURE will use a deployable membrane-like mirror. The mirror figure will be corrected after deployment to bring it into better or equal lambda/20 deviations from the prescribed mirror shape, where lambda (typically 400 nm-1 micron) is the operational wavelength. Instead of using the classical piezoelectric-patch technology, our concept is based on a continuous coating of a Magnetic Smart Material (MSM). We expect that the initially deployed mirror will not have a perfect figure. Thus our design uses magnetic write heads to produce stress in the MSM and improve the figure, post deployment. This Phase II NIAC proposal is to address two of the tall poles in the concept: (a) Can corrections on a large size be made and retained for a long enough time (> 1 week); (b) Can deployment be done in such a way that the figures corrections are small enough to be correctable via the MSM plus magnetic field, and at the same time, the in plane stresses as small enough to allow the stresses resulting magnetic field injected into the MSM plus magnetic fields to make the necessary corrections. Tall pole “a” will be primarily the responsibility of Northwestern University (NU) and “b” of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. NU will carry out overall scientific leadership and will coordinate and solicit input from GSFC, JPL, and NIST.* [Intelligent Flamefinder Detection and Alert System (IFDAS), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j876-witj) - NASA test and launch facilities, such as those at Stennis, Marshall, and other locations, require large amounts of hydrogen as a primary rocket fuel; hydrogen is also of growing interest in the private sector. Unfortunately, hydrogen burns with an essentially invisible flame, making detection of hydrogen fires difficult. Current methods of detecting hydrogen leaks and fires are limited in a number of ways; video-based methods (IR and otherwise) are promising, but can be seriously misled by reflections and currently require human operators (increasing expense and leading to problems of attentiveness).

To address these and other challenges, IEM proposes to create the Intelligent Flamefinder<SUP>TM</SUP> Detection and Alert System (IFDAS). Drawing on smart video analysis and other smart sensor work for NASA, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Navy, and others, and building on an exclusive license of patented NASA technology, IEM will create a smart hydrogen fire detection system which will reliably detect even small (less than 3") flames, ignore false signals from reflections of flames, the sun, or other heat/light sources, accurately determine the location of the flames, and automatically alert the appropriate individuals or systems of the existence, extent, and location of the fire, without the need for human operators or intervention prior to the alert. IFDAS will also be able to interface with current sensing systems and integrate their data to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation using all available data. The individual units will be compact, low-power, and rugged, for use indoors or outdoors, and be applicable for uses in NASA, the military, and commercial enterprises involving hydrogen or other flammable materials which have difficult-to-detect flames.* [RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of reactive oxygen species gene network in Mizuna plants grown in long-term space flight](https://data.nasa.gov/d/af4u-mnh4) - Space environment is suspected to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce oxidative stress in plants however little is known about the gene expression of ROS gene network in plants grown in long-term space flight. RNA-Seq was used to define the large-scale gene expression profiles of Mizuna harvested after 27 days cultivation in the international space station to understand the molecular response and adaptation to space environment.Results: Total reads of transcripts from the Mizuna grown in the international space station as well as on the ground by RNA-Seq using next generation sequencing technology showed 8,258 and 14,170 transcripts up- and down-regulated in the space-grown Mizuna respectively when compared with those from the ground-grown Mizuna. A total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative marker genes were up-regulated including high expression of 4 hallmarks and preferentially expressed gene associated with ROS-scavenging genes was thioredoxin glutaredoxin and alternative oxidase genes. In the transcription factors of ROS gene network MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 OXI1-MKK4-MPK3 and OXI1-MPK3 of MAP cascades induction of WRKY22 by MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 cascade induction of WRKY25 and repression of ZAT7 by Zat12 were suggested. RbohD and RbohF genes were up-regulated preferentially in NADPH oxidase genes which produce ROS.Conclusions: Our large-scale transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the space environment induced oxidative stress and ROS gene network was activated in the space-grown Mizuna some of which were common genes up-regulated by abiotic and biotic stress and were preferentially up-regulated genes by the space environment even though Mizuna grew in the space as well as on the ground showing that plants could acclimate to the space environment by reprograming the expression of ROS gene network.* [Remote Data Exploration with the Interactive Data Language, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5pm2-x74e) - We propose to develop a tool for NASA researchers based on IDL and DAP for user-friendly remote data access.  A popular data analysis tool in the NASA research community is IDL (Interactive Data Language).  A main limitation presently on performing data analysis with IDL for NASA researchers is that often the data to analyze is located remotely from the scientist, and also, often the data is too  
large to transfer for local analysis.    Researchers have developed a  
protocol for accessing remote data, the Data Access Protocol (DAP), and one can use DAP from within IDL, but presently using the DAP-IDL interface is both limited and cumbersome.  We propose to develop a more powerful, user-friendly interface to DAP for IDL.  At the completion of this work, users will be able to browse remote data sets from an IDL GUI, have an interactive IDL command line session simultaneous with the remote visualization and write custom IDL functions that will act on the remote data with results displayed locally.  We will make all of these IDL-DAP tools usable seamlessly for any IDL user.* [ATM OBSERVATIONS AT NEVADA TEST SITE V1.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/py5a-qfy3) - This data set contains digital elevation data for three explosion craters in the Nevada Test Site. These data were acquired by the Wallops/GSFC Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) in September 2003.* [SMEX03 Surface Roughness Data, Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u6b3-djn5) - The data set SMEX03 Surface Roughness Data is comprised of data collected over the regional study areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, USA as part of the 2003 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX03).* [Bringing 3D Memory Cubes to Space: a "Rad-Hard by Design Study" with an Open Architecture, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f2n3-h4a6) - The computing capabilities of onboard spacecraft are a major limiting factor for accomplishing many classes of future missions. Although technology development efforts are underway that will provide improvements to spacecraft CPUs, they do not address the limitations of current onboard memory systems. In addition to CPU upgrades, effective execution of data-intensive operations such as terrain relative navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning and scheduling, and onboard science data processing and analysis require high-bandwidth, low-latency memory systems to maximize processor usage (the memory wall) and provide rapid access to observational data captured by high-data-rate instruments (e.g., Hyperspectral Infrared Imager, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar).
3D ICs, after a long wait, is now a reality. The first mainstream product is 3D memory cubes, where multiple memory tiers (4 DRAM tiers as of 2015) are vertically integrated to offer manifold improvement in size, capacity, speed, and power consumption compared with 2D counterparts. Indeed, these are the memory parts that will truly enable aforementioned missions. Unfortunately, none of these are ready for space. The purpose of this research is to investigate the challenges and opportunities in deploying 3D memory cubes into space missions.* [Multi-Sensor Aerial Intrusion Detector, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/66b3-vwij) - NASA is seeking means to increase surveillance efficiency during mission launch operations. Launch delays are expensive, so any incremental increase in efficiency of launch range surveillance should produce large cost savings. To meet this requirement, Broadata Communications, Inc. (BCI) proposes to develop a new combined hardware and software sensor package for early intrusion detection called Multi-Sensor Aerial Intrusion Identifier that will be suitable for mounting in small UAVs of 10 feet wing span or less.  The proposed intrusion detection system will be based on combining the output from three separate sensor systems: IR, Doppler Motion, and Stereo Video, to increase the reliability and sensor detection range compared to using any of these sensor systems on its own. The combined systems will have a 3-5 nautical mile forward detection range, compared to 1 nautical mile detection range for each individual sensor.  It will produce a reduction of at least a factor of 3 in the number of small UAVs needed for launch range surveillance, and consequently, a dramatic reduction in the cost of surveillance.  The UAVs will be equipped with warning sirens and warning lights to issue warnings to intruders, further automating launch range safety operations.* [CALIPSO Lidar Level 2 Polar Stratospheric Clouds Data Product Ensemble, Provisional V1-10](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u8r8-7ptt) - CAL_LID_L2_PSCMask-Prov-V1-00 data are Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Lidar Level 2 Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC) profiles of PSC presence, composition, optical properties, and meteorological information along CALIPSO orbit tracks. The PSC data product ensemble describes the spatial distribution and optical properties of PSC layers observed by the CALIPSO lidar. Each file contains data from all nighttime orbit segments from a single day reported on a 5-km horizontal by 180-m vertical grid. PSC detection is limited to nighttime CALIOP observations because higher levels of background light during daytime significantly reduce the signal-to-noise and, hence, the PSC detection sensitivity. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) was launched on April 28, 2006 to study the impact of clouds and aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget and climate. It flies in the international A-Train constellation for coincident Earth observations. The CALIPSO satellite comprises three instruments, the Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), the Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR), and the Wide Field Camera (WFC). CALIPSO is a joint satellite mission between NASA and the French Agency, CNES.* [Airborne Multi-Gas Sensor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/giud-whxf) - Mesa Photonics proposes to develop an Airborne Multi-Gas Sensor (AMUGS) based upon two-tone, frequency modulation spectroscopy (TT-FMS). Mesa Photonics has developed a fiber-coupled implementation of TT-FMS that leverages telecommunications lasers as sources and WiFi electronics for signal processing. With this approach, sensitive trace gas detection in a robust, compact and low-power package has been achieved. In work to-date, we have demonstrated the capability of this TT-FMS concept in a single channel. In the proposed project, we aim to demonstrate multiplexing of TT-FMS to provide simultaneous, real-time measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). In addition to demonstrating the extensibility of TT-FMS, the Phase I project would address key performance limitations encountered in early feasibility work. 

The objectives of Phase I are to:
 - Implement and test polarization management during phase modulation to reduce baseline variation induced by observed in previous work,
 - Build a two-channel TT-FMS with breadboard components,
 - Establish baseline (single-channel) performance of TT-FMS when polarization maintaining phase modulation is included,
 - Calibrate and evaluate the full AMGUS (two-channel, TT-FMS) apparatus.

Accomplishment of Phase I objectives would yield a benchtop technology ready for transition to a UAV-compatible AMUGS prototype in Phase II.* [Global Cyclone Total Economic Loss Risk Deciles](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xr52-id7s) - Global Drought Hazard Frequency and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid based upon the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction's (IRI) Weighted Anomaly of Standardized Precipitation (WASP). Utilizing average monthly precipitation data from 1980 through 2000 at a resolution of 2.5 degrees, WASP assesses the precipitation deficit or surplus over a three month temporal window that is weighted by the magnitude of the seasonal cyclic variation in precipitation. The three months' averages are derived from the precipitation data and the median rainfall for the 21 year period is calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells where the three month running average of precipitation is less than 1 mm per day ae excluded. Drought events are identified when the magnitude of a monthly precipitation deficit is less than or equal to 50 percent of its longterm median value for three or more consecutive months. Grid cells are then divided into 10 classes having an approximately equal number of grid cells. Higher grid cell values denote higher frequencies of drought occurrences. This dataset is the result of collaboration among the Columbia University Center for Hazards and Risk Research (CHRR), Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI), and Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Predicting the Dust Environment During Powered Descent on Mars](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s7ij-5a7b) - Discuss the current state-of-the-art and the limitations of current plume/surface multi-phase flow modeling.* [Simulating CubeSat Structure Deployment Dynamics, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/r27a-ag8u) - There is high value in simulating the nonlinear dynamics of stowing, deploying, and performance of deployable space structures, especially given the profound limitations of physical testing. Dynamic simulation can reduce the risk of developing new deployable space structures, including solar arrays, by predicting transient motions and loads during stowage, deployment, and mission-related maneuvers. Dynamic simulation can also be used to assess the efficacy of using motion control to mitigate the effect of accelerations on the response of the space structure.

The proposed innovations of this proposal are: 1) Development of a general automated process to efficiently take a detailed hinge assembly model and simulate its range of motion while retrieving stiffness information for all degrees of freedom and convert that data to define a simple but accurate nonlinear point-to-point force for use in the solar array assembly model, 2) Development and simulation of a high-fidelity system-level model of the deployment dynamics of an commercial deployable solar array that was designed for use with a 6U cubesat, and 3) Review and evaluation of the hinge assembly simplification process and the modeling approach by an independent resource.

The significance of the proposed innovation is:  1) This work builds upon previous simulation success with a split-tube solar array by adding a new automated method to efficiently develop an accurate but simplified representation of the connections used on rigid panel solar arrays, 2) This is an initial engagement with the products of the smallsat community and a commercial cubesat solar array will be simulated. The successful results may encourage the smallsat community to use this technology, thereby reducing technical risk, 3) The simulation of a commercial cubesat solar array in this project potentially leads to obtaining validation comparisons between the simulation and physical test results during a corresponding Phase II effort.* [In-situ Airborne Sampler for Advanced Guided Dropsonde, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sxzk-bbn6) - The proposed innovation is a low-cost, retrievable and reusable, autonomously guided dropsonde capable of in-situ atmospheric measurements.  The proposed effort will focus on the engineering work involved with the retrieval of volcanic ash plume samples.  This work will build upon a previous NASA SBIR Phase I project Latitude Engineering completed in 2011: the development of an Advanced Guided Dropsonde (AGD).   Though the tested prototype received favorable reviews, funding restructuring of the SBIR program within NASA prevented funding for Phase II.  To keep the momentum behind this innovative airborne platform, Latitude Engineering is proposing to build upon this accomplishment: refine the current dropsonde design and develop a sampling system for atmospheric particulates that will be integrated into this 4 cm diameter research vessel.  Miniaturized particulate sampling equipment for airborne missions is not commercially available.  Even for full scale systems, many research programs develop their own collection and sensor systems.  With the small size limitations of the AGD, a multi-stage particulate sampler can be developed that can collect size segregated particulate including aerosols.  With the significant need for atmospheric particulate sampling, the AGD can offer unprecedented access to atmospheric samples including those at high altitudes.
The key goals of this Phase I proposal are to demonstrate the capability of the AGD to be released from a host manned aircraft, collect an atmospheric particulate sample from a pre-programmed altitude and location, and deliver the protected sample to a pre-programmed recovery area. This system, engineered to be cost compatible with existing dropsonde launch systems, is recoverable and re-useable.* [Global Annual Average PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y3ja-bq7v) - Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data sets represent a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data. Together the grids provide a continuous surface of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. The satellite AOD retrievals were converted to ground-level concentrations based on a conversion factor developed by researchers at Dalhousie University that accounts for spatial and temporal variations in aerosol properties and vertical structure as derived from a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 30 arc-minutes (0.5 degree or approximately 50 sq. km at the equator) and cover the world from 70°N to 60°S latitude. The grids were produced by researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute in collaboration with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network/Columbia University under a NASA-ROSES project entitled "Using Satellite Data to Develop Environmental Indicators: An Application of NASA Data Products to Support High Level Decisions for National and International Environmental Protection". Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature death as well as increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease, especially in the elderly, young children, and those already suffering from these illnesses. The World Health Organization guideline for PM2.5 average annual exposure is less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms per cubic meter, whereas the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) primary standard is less than or equal to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA primary standards are designed to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.* [6 CFM Electrochemical Hydrogen Pump and Compressor, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qqcy-j8v5) - Hydrogen is an essential resource for space missions. NASA has a need
for equipment to generate, handle and store hydrogen. In terms of
handling hydrogen, conventional rotating mechanical pumps and
compressors require extensive modification and have limited reliability.
Electrochemical pumping and compression of hydrogen occurs without any
moving parts and is highly reliable and efficient. Sustainable
Innovations has demonstrated up to 6,000 psi of compression using
electrochemical cell hardware. However, for high flow applications, such
as a 6 CFM hydrogen pump for NASA, a departure from traditional
electrochemical cell hardware designs is needed. The proposed Expandable
Modular Architecture cell design, allows a large variable footprint for
the electrochemical stack. This is achieved using modular cell parts to
create large active area cells. The modular parts are inexpensive to
manufacture and can achieve the high tolerances need for large active
area cells.  The proposed Phase I activity will demonstrate a single
cell Electrochemical Hydrogen Pump &amp; Compressor (EHPC) using the EMA
design to validate the modularity of the cell components. The ability to
stack large active area cells will also be demonstrated with a four cell
EHPC. For both pieces of cell hardware, cycling a pneumatic device will
be demonstrated. A manufacturing study will also be undertaken to
validate the compatibility of the EMA design with cost reduction
pathways. This will facilitate establishing the design criteria for a
3-4 CFM  1,000 psi EHPC to be constructed on Phase II* [Prognostic Fault Detection and Isolation for EMA and EPS Systems, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jqrs-9rqh) - In response to NASA SBIR topic X1.04, Ridgetop Group will extend and adapt RingDown: an innovative system for the non-invasive prognostic monitoring of the health of electromechanical actuators and related power systems.  This comprehensive solution provides both advanced hardware sensors to monitor the systems and prognostic health management algorithms to interpret the signals available in them.  RingDown will significantly improve the reliability of and confidence in these critical NASA systems by alerting NASA personnel to impending failures well before they occur, averting disaster and improving confidence in the health of the systems.
Electromechanical actuators (EMAs) are comprised of a complex system-of-systems: a high-power switch mode power supply to power the EMA's servo drive, a lower-voltage switch mode power supply to power the EMA's logic controller, power inverters, and the EMA itself.  The sensors and algorithms provided by Ridgetop will allow NASA to monitor the health of-and anticipate failures in-all of these systems.  In addition, these algorithms will be applicable to other switch mode power supplies (SMPSs), which are a very common component in NASA's electrical systems.
Ridgetop's goal in this SBIR program is to transition these EMA prognostic health management technologies into fielded systems.  In Phase I, Ridgetop will extend the RingDown sensors developed under previous NASA SBIRs to monitor additional components in the EMA system-of-systems.  Ridgetop will also prototype the algorithms to interpret the data from those sensors in this Phase. In Phase II, Ridgetop will implement additional functionality for these algorithms and then field-test the combined algorithm and sensor solution.  In a future Phase III or other commercialization program, a final version of this comprehensive solution will be demonstrated in-flight and then transitioned into actual system usage.* [Novel, Regenerable Microlith Catalytic Reactor for CO2 Reduction via Bosch Process, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9r98-4rdk) - Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) proposes to develop an extremely compact, lightweight and regenerable Microlith<SUP>REG</SUP> catalytic CO2 reduction reactor, capable of converting mixtures of CO2 and H2 to carbon and water vapor with high CO2 conversions at high throughputs and at low operating temperatures. This is based on a novel catalytic reactor approach with high heat and mass transfer, high conversion efficiency, narrow temperature distribution, and novel approaches to carbon removal. The utilization of carbon dioxide to produce life support consumables, such as O2 and H2O, via Bosch reaction offers a potential advance for NASA's cabin atmosphere revitalization system (ARS) and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) concepts for long-term manned space missions. Current Bosch reactor designs suffer from a large recycle penalty due to slow reaction rates and the inherent limitation in approaching thermodynamic equilibrium, plus significant challenge in carbon removal. PCI's short contact time catalysts offer the potential for faster reaction rates, higher conversions and a reduced need for recycle. In addition, strategies will be explored for more effective mechanical and chemical approaches to carbon removal and catalyst regeneration.  The approach offers a potential for an ultra-compact Bosch reactor with improved effectiveness and robustness, with lower pressure drop and power requirement.* [Lidar Orbital Angular Momentum Sensor](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qbdv-6rh2) - The recognition in recent decades  that electromagnetic fields have angular momentum (AM)  in the form of not only polarization (or spin AM) but also orbital (OAM) has resulted in an explosion of  theoretical and experimental studies to understand the possible implications of these fields and their applications. The first applications have been achieved in astronomy (exoplanet vortex coronagraph), particle manipulation (optical tweezers), and encoding information on lasers (optical communication). OAM is a previously unrecognized degree of freedom for light that can be readily controlled, manipulated, and detected in laser beams characterized by helical wavefronts that rotate forward like a screw (vortex beams). The objective of the proposed effort is to utilize vortex beams to significantly increase the information that can be obtained from backscatter lidars. A lidar receiver will be developed that incorporates an optical angular momentum mode sorter. This will provide improved daytime performance by the spatial coherency filtering of background light and allow single scattering to be uniquely distinguished from multiple scattering in turbid environments (dense clouds, coastal waters). The latter is analogous to the exoplanet coronagraph: the lidar beam will be detected to greater optical depth into turbid media because the bright haze of multiple scattering will be eliminated. The effort will go on to demonstrate how examples of vortex beams can be created that will interact with the atmosphere in different ways, improving overall lidar performance. This three year effort will bring the measurement concept and receiver technology from a TRL 2 to 4.* [SAFARI 2000 Daily Rainfall Estimates, 0.1-Deg, Southern Africa, 1993-2001](https://data.nasa.gov/d/mhr3-7s6d) - The Microwave InfraRed Algorithm (MIRA) is used to produce an imagery data set of daily mean rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution over southern Africa for the period 1993-2001. MIRA combines passive microwave (PMW) from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) on board the DMSP F10 and F14 satellites at a resolution of 0.5 degrees and infrared (IR) data from the Meteosat 4, 5, 6, and 7 satellites in 2-hour slots at a resolution of 5 km. This approach accounts for the limitations of both data types in estimating precipitation. Rainfall estimates are produced at the high spatial and temporal frequency of the IR data using rainfall information from the PMW data. An IR/rain rate relationship, variable in space and time, is derived from coincident observations of IR and PMW rain rate (accumulated over a calibration domain) using the probability matching method. The IR/rain rate relationship is then applied to IR imagery at full temporal resolution. The results presented here are the daily means of those derived rain rates at 0.1 degree spatial resolution.The rainfall data sets are flat binary images with no headers. They are compressed band sequential (bsq) files that contain all of the daily images for the given year. Each image is an array of 401 lines, each with 341 binary floating-point numbers, containing rainfall at 0.1 degree resolution for the area 10 to 50 degrees longitude and 0 to -34 degrees latitude. The number of band sequential images in each annual file and the associated dates can be found in the file MIRA_data_dates.csv.* [SMEX03 Soil Texture Data: Alabama, Version 1](https://data.nasa.gov/d/uxcc-amkw) - Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the Principal Investigator(s) and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.

This ancillary data file provides soil texture classes for Soil Climate and Analysis (SCAN) sites in northern Alabama, USA associated with the Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03).* [Advanced Gas Sensing Technology for Space Suits, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/r6h6-g45t) - Advanced space suits require lightweight, low-power, durable sensors for monitoring critical life support materials. No current compact sensors have the tolerance for liquid water that is specifically required for portable life support systems (PLSS). Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) will develop a luminescence-based optical sensor probe to monitor carbon dioxide, oxygen, and humidity, and selected trace contaminants. Our monitor will incorporate robust CO2, O2, and H2O partial pressure sensors interrogated by a compact, low-power optoelectronic unit. The sensors will not only tolerate liquid water but will actually operate while wet, and can be remotely connected to electronic circuitry by an optical fiber cable immune to electromagnetic interference. For space systems, these miniature sensor elements with remote optoelectronics give unmatched design flexibility for measurements in highly constrained volume systems such as PLSS. Our flow-through monitor design includes an optical sensor we have already developed for PLSS humidity monitoring, and an optical oxygen sensor, both of them based on a common IOS technology. In prior projects IOS has demonstrated a CO2 sensor capable of operating while wet that also met PLSS environmental and analytical requirements, but did not meet life requirements. A new generation of CO2 sensors will be developed to advance this sensor technology and fully meet all NASA requirements, including sensor life. The totally novel approach will overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art luminescent sensors for CO2. Additional sensors will be developed to monitor trace contaminants often found in the ventilation loop as result of material off-gassing or crew member metabolism. IOS has established collaboration with UTC Aerospace Systems to produce prototypes for space qualification, and will conduct extensive testing under simulated space conditions, ensuring a smooth path to technology infusion.* [Rad-Hard and ULP FPGA with "Full" Functionality, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/sayx-xaxy) - RNET has demonstrated the feasibility of developing an innovative radiation hardened (RH) and ultra low power (ULP) field programmable gate array (FPGA), called the RH/ULP FPGA.  The design utilizes an advanced SOI process technology.

It is the vision of RNET to develop a family of radiation hardened FPGA products with a variety of features including programmable logic, configurable analog functions, soft/hardcore microprocessor, dedicated DSP functions, I/O, dedicated memory blocks, memory controllers, global clock, and JTAG interface. In addition, specialized circuits for mitigation of TID/temperature effects, radiation hardened by design SEU techniques, and memory scrubbing are planned.  

Our vision at the conclusion of this proposed SBIR is to fabricate a "commercial" RH/ULP FPGA with the most important features listed.  Ideally the FPGA to be developed under the proposed Phase 2 would contain all of these features, but due to the limitation of funds and allotted time, a scaled down version would be completed.  The envisioned device will incorporate the basic programmable logic functions, dedicated block RAM, DSP functions, configurable I/O, global clock distribution network, and JTAG interface.  Phase 2 will set the stage for more feature-rich product families to be developed as commercialization continues.* [Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Liquid-Fueled Rocket Prop...](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xcj3-ysi5) - Title: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Liquid-Fueled Rocket Propulsion Health Monitoring.

Abstract: This article describes the results of applying four unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms to data from two rocket propulsion testbeds. The first testbed uses historical data from the Space Shuttle Main Engine. The second testbed uses data from an experimental rocket engine test stand located at NASA Stennis Space Center. The article describes nine anomalies detected by the four algorithms. The four algorithms use four different definitions of anomalousness. Orca uses a nearest-neighbor approach, defining a point to be an anomaly if its nearest neighbors in the data space are far away from it. The Inductive Monitoring System clusters the training data, and then uses the distance to the nearest cluster as its measure of anomalousness. GritBot learns rules from the training data, and then classifies points as anomalous if they violate these rules. One-class support vector machines map the data into a high-dimensional space in which most of the normal points are on one side of a hyperplane, and then classify points on the other side of the hyperplane as anomalous. Because of these different definitions of anomalousness, different algorithms detect different anomalies. We therefore conclude that it is useful to use multiple algorithms.* [Innoflight Middleware System (IMS), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7ihm-8kah) - Space missions can benefit greatly from the use of the latest COTS processing technology in order to allow spacecraft to perform more onboard computation using less power.  This trend has accelerated in recent years due to the explosion of low-power commercial processing technology driven by mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.  Many of these advanced devices contain multiple processing cores, and some are full System-on-Chip (SoC) parts that include GPU processor arrays or FPGA fabric.
However, while these COTS multi-core processors have tremendous capability, they are not designed to be tolerant to the radiation effects that are experienced in the space environment.  One approach to increasing the reliability of COTS processors in space is to implement redundancy within the software framework.  With this technique, the multiple cores in a processing device and even multiple independent computers can be operated in any combination of parallel processing (for enhanced performance) and redundantly (for enhanced reliability).  For this proposed project, we plan to develop the Innoflight Middleware System (IMS) in order to provide this capability.* [Theoretically Optimal Distributed Anomaly Detection](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ht3u-kjpr) - A novel general framework for distributed anomaly detection with theoretical performance guarantees is proposed. Our algorithmic approach combines existing anomaly detection procedures with a novel method for computing global statistics using local sufficient statistics. Under a Gaussian assumption, our distributed algorithm is guaranteed to perform as well as its centralized counterpart, a condition we call Ôzero information lossÕ. We further report experimental results on synthetic as well as real-world data to demonstrate the viability of our approach.* [U.S. Population Grids (Summary File 1), 2000: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, Alpha Version](https://data.nasa.gov/d/q5sn-2g23) - U.S. Population Grids (Summary File 1), 2000: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, Alpha Version contains an ARC/INFO Workspace with grids of   demographic data from the year 2000 census. The grids have a resolution of 30 arc-seconds (0.0083 decimal degrees), or approximately 1 square km. The gridded variables are based on census   block geography from Census 2000 TIGER/Line Files and census variables (population, households, and housing variables). This dataset is produced by the Columbia University Center for   International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [ANSIBLE: A Network of Social Interactions for Bilateral Life Enhancement, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/x3ic-v679) - Studies in ground-based analogs of Isolated and Confined Environments (ICE) have identified sensory monotony and social isolation as threats to crew psychological well-being.  Further, the lack of real-time communications in future missions will impact crew interactions with their support systems, i.e. family, friends, and colleagues, are critical.  ANSIBLE (A Network of Social Interactions for Bilateral Life Enhancement) leverages evidence based strategies to 1) augment asynchronous communications using Virtual Environments (VEs) and facilitate novel interaction methods beyond email, 2) use the inherently immersive and stimuli rich nature of VEs to counteract sensory monotony, and 3) leverages VEs and intelligent Virtual Agents (VAs) as companions and advisors to combat social monotony and detect changes in astronaut psychosocial states can increase astronaut self-awareness, suggest countermeasures, and provide rehearsal scenarios to maintain and enhance interpersonal skills.  Along with Dr. Morie, SIFT will leverage its prior work with human communication models and unobtrusive detection of psychosocial dimensions, to enhance VE and VA technologies. The resulting tool will advance  the future social landscape that connects the flight crew with Earth, and can be used pre, during, and post flight to connect crew and ground, providing a sense of social consistency and permanence.* [Onboard Generic Fault Detection Algorithm Development and Demonstration for VTOL sUAS, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/xwv7-ssua) - In the proposed SBIR study, Empirical Systems Aerospace, Inc. (ESAero) will develop a fault detection and identification avionics system implementing a generic statistical fault detection algorithm and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through flight testing on board a VTOL UAV testbed. The algorithm is aimed to be generic in the sense that it is agnostic to the specific platform or avionics suite on which it is implemented, making the developed technology broadly applicable to VTOL aircraft configurations, other aircraft types, and beyond. Using a statistics-based method, the system will not need to have direct knowledge of the sensors, the system, or the vehicle configuration. By simply monitoring the available sensors and comparing their signals to a trained nominal statistical data model, abnormalities in systems, sub-systems and individual components can be detected before a major failure occurs, greatly improving system operational safety and potentially significantly reducing maintenance costs. To develop the fault detection system, the team will leverage previous ePHM (Prognostic and Health Management) investment and configure a COTS VTOL UAV with a sensor suite and onboard data acquisition and processing system. The team will operate this VTOL UAV testbed to acquire data for nominal operation and then intentionally inject failures into the system to gather data for various faulty operations. The algorithm will be adapted to this dataset and loaded onto the testbed. Finally, in Phase I, ESAero will demonstrate the fault detection algorithm in flight verifying that the algorithm is capable of both detecting and identifying faults during actual operation. In Phase II, ESAero envisions further productionizing the technology by working with commercial motor and speed control vendors to broaden the statistical dataset and miniaturize the sensor and processing modules with the goal to integrate into existing hardware offerings.* [Low-Cost, Lightweight Transpiration-Cooled LOX/CH4 Engine, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/wj6z-88au) - The specific impulse of a rocket engine increases as the chamber pressure increases, but so does the heat flux to the chamber wall. Ultimately, this defines the maximum operating pressure for the engine. For regeneratively cooled engines, even those using film cooling, the practical limit has been reached, and further increases in chamber pressure are simply not possible. Transpiration cooling does not have this limitation. Furthermore, because a transpiration-cooled engine pumps only a tiny fraction of the fuel through the wall, a smaller and hence lighter pump can be used, which will significantly reduce the dry mass. Finally, because transpiration cooling can keep the wall much cooler than regenerative cooling with film cooling, a transpiration-cooled engine can use less refractory (i.e., lighter weight) materials, thereby achieving additional reductions in dry mass. The net results are significant increases in the thrust-to-weight ratio and specific impulse and a significant decrease in the dry mass of the system. The perceived limitation of transpiration cooling with a porous wall is coking and blockage of the pores if a carbon-based fuel such as methane is used. In previous work using LOX/H2 propellant, Ultramet showed that with minimal transpiration flow, the wall temperature can be kept well below the point at which methane would form coke. In this project, Ultramet will work with Purdue University to build on previous success with transpiration cooling in LOX/H2 engines and design a lightweight LOX/LCH4 engine in the 10,000- to 25,000-lbf thrust range. The transpiration model will be physics-based and applicable to both LOX/LCH4 and LOX/H2. Key component demonstrators will be fabricated and used to collect empirical data on the thermal, structural, and hydraulic characteristics of the wall architecture. Transpiration rates on subscale hardware will be verified through flow testing, and empirical data will be used to verify the predicted lack of coking.* [IRAS MINOR PLANET SURVEY ASTEROIDS V3.0](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hnsd-xx6s) - The data presented with this data set include: (a) 8210 individual sightings associated with 2004 asteroids, (b) averaged radiometric diameters and geometric albedos derived from individual observations for 1796 numbered asteroids and 88 unnumbered asteroids (as of 1983) whose orbital elements were determined using astrometry from two or more apparitions; (c) an entry for each of 120 asteroids for which there is an accepted sighting; (d) entries for each of 4677 numbered asteroids and 2632 unnumbered asteroids (as of 1985) for which associations were sought in the IRAS data; (e) A summary of the number of times each asteroid was predicted to be scanned, and possible reasons for any failure to be detected.* [Flash 3D Enhancements for Autonomous Precision Landing and Hazard Detection and Avoidance, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/u6de-ykyb) - With NASA's exploration initiative to return to Lunar Exploration and eventual human exploration of Mars, NASA has an increased need for advanced Autonomous Precision Landing and Hazard Detection and Avoidance solutions.  Scanning LADAR and stereo video have significant shortcoming while ASC's Flash LADAR 3D video cameras can provide frames of 3D data in real time at video rates.  The proposed high-sensitivity unit cell and ROIC enhances the sensitivity of ASC's standard ROIC by a very large factor as well as decreasing the associated unit cell area by a large factor. This enhancement reduces required laser power, reduces focal plane array power, allows PIN diode arrays to compete with APD detector arrays and increases the number of pixels possible in a given ROIC area.
	Advanced Scientific Concepts Inc. (ASC) is a small business that has developed a number of 3D flash LADAR systems.  Flash Ladar Video Cameras (FLVC) are 3D vision systems that return range and intensity information for each pixel in real time.  The ASC camera with its 128x128 3D array is the equivalent of 16000 range finders on one chip.  This allows the sensor to act as a 3D video camera with functionality well beyond just range finding.  Its small size, low power and fast range data frame rate (30Hz) provides an ideal Landing and Hazard Detection and Avoidance sensor* [Advanced Calibration Source for Planetary and Earth Observing Imaging](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kdwn-9pmd) - <p><strong>Planetary and Earth imaging requires radiometrically calibrated and stable imaging sensors.&nbsp; Radiometric calibration enables the ability to remove or mitigate sensor-specific and environmental anomalies from the data and to convert a sensor&rsquo;s output to common engineering units (e.g. radiance or reflectance).&nbsp; Additionally, radiometric calibration provides the means to compare image sets acquired by multiple sensors at different times and geometries.&nbsp; </strong></p><p><strong>Sensor radiometric calibration and stability is typically accomplished by initially calibrating an imaging sensor in a laboratory before it is fielded or integrated onto a spacecraft and launched.

Working in conjunction with a database of optical properties for known obscurants, the system will be capable of identifying the type and severity of the hazard.  While several different LIDAR ranging techniques are currently employed for airborne detection applications, the RL Associates Inc. hazard detection and mitigation system is based upon our patented range-gated technique used in our FireLidar system.  This technique allows not only detection of obscurants, but can also be used to image through obscurants and thus mitigate the hazard.  RL Associates Inc. is currently leading the industry in shortwave infrared (1.5 um) active imaging systems and plans to use that technology in developing the SWIR LIDAR Hazard Detection System.  This system will be compact and lightweight and will operate around 1.5 um, which is safe to the human eye.* [Two-Dimensional Differential Deposition and Erosion for Thin-Shell Figure Correction, and Non-Distorting, High-Energy X-ray Multilayers](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f3u5-czxi) - We propose to continue our development of two-dimensional differential deposition and erosion, a novel methods for high-throughput surface height error correction in thin-shell cylindrical mirror substrates. We also propose to develop non-distorting X-ray reflective multilayer coatings for use above 80 keV. Our specific research objectives are: (a) develop two-dimensional control of film deposition and erosion to correct both low- and mid-frequency surface height errors in cylindrical, thin-shell mirror substrates, and (b) develop high-efficiency, non-distorting, zero net-stress, and stress balanced, reflective multilayer coatings for use above 80 keV.* [Ultrasound Fracture Diagnosis in Space](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yjsd-3znq) - This ground-based proposal accumulated high-level clinical evidence on the sensitivity and specificity of point of care ultrasound performed by expert and novice users for the rapid diagnosis of musculoskeletal injuries. This proposal developed preliminary educational methodologies to provide just-in-time training of novice users by creating multi-media training tools and imaging procedures for non expert operators. Expanded diagnostic use of ultrasound is being substantiated for the diagnosis of specific musculoskeletal injuries deemed possible in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and future exploration-class missions. This final report summarizes the sensitivity and specificity of non-expert performed musculoskeletal ultrasound to diagnose acute injuries.     
This Final Report covers Specific Aim I and II in the cooperative agreement:    
1. Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for bone fractures, associated muscle trauma, and fracture healing in a ground-based study at an academic medical center.    
EXPERT OPERATORS: We identified patients with potential musculoskeletal injuries in an urban, Level 1 trauma center based on mechanism of injury and the presenting complaint. Potential subjects were given a summary of the study and invited to participate following informed consent. A GE Logiq-e portable ultrasound device with a 12 MHz linear probe was used for the ultrasound investigations in this study.  The initial musculoskeletal (MSK) evaluations were performed and interpreted by ultrasound experts with extensive experience in MSK ultrasound. These examinations were also used to fashion cue cards and short video based educational aids to allow non-expert operators to perform complex ultrasound examinations for the later investigations in Specific Aim II.  The examinations confirmed earlier investigations at our institution which have demonstrated a very high sensitivity and specificity for ultrasound when performed with a portable ultrasound machine by an expert. There were no false positive examinations in this study. There was one false negative in a non displaced, sub-capital fracture of the hip in an obese patient. This patient also had a negative X-ray and was found to have a fracture on a subsequent MRI for continued pain.     
There were a number of additional soft tissue ultrasound examinations in this patient subgroup which showed soft tissue edema, hematoma formation, tendon-ligament tears, and foreign bodies.     
The analysis of this data set obtained and interpreted by MSK ultrasound experts suggests that  2D ultrasound provides a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of musculoskeletal trauma and that 3D or volumetric ultrasound is not necessary to obtain a correct diagnosis in experts' hands.     
NOVICE OPERATOR:    
Over 850 patients were screened for enrollment in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital. Initial patient screening was done by Trauma Surgery or Emergency Medicine staff based on mechanism of injury, history, and presenting signs and symptoms suggestive of significant musculoskeletal injury.     
Informed consent was obtained and a localized ultrasound examination was completed prior to radiographic evaluation by minimally trained personnel using a 10.5 MHz linear probe. The ultrasound examination was initially done on the contra lateral, non-injured side to obtain a reference image and to optimize visualization and focal zone. The entire length of the bone was visualized with special attention to the injured area. A positive scan consisted of identification of cortical disruption or discontinuity. Secondary hematomas and muscular injury were also recorded. Routine radiographic imaging was then completed for comparison against the ultrasound examination.    
Demographic, anatomic, and radiographic information was collected for correlation to the ultrasonographic findings. A diagnostic scoring sheet with patient and exam-specific data was filled out by the operator* [LBA-ECO LC-09 Soil Composition and Structure in the Brazilian Amazon: 1992-1995](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2vc5-6iuh) - This data set reports basic soil structure and composition information for five Amazonian research sites: Altamira, Bragantina, Tome-Acu, and Ponta de Pedras, all four in the state of Para, Brazil; and one site in Yapu, Colombia. Soil characteristics reported for all five study sites include cation information (e.g., H, Al, Mg, K, Na, S), percent of soil C, N, and organic matter, soil texture/composition and color, pH, and land use history. Soil bulk density and tons of carbon/ha are reported for only three of the study sites: Altamira, Bragantina, and Tome-Acu. All of the data are provided in one comma-separated data file.The five study areas represent characteristic differences in soil fertility and a range of land uses typical of the Amazon region. One of these areas, Altamira, is characterized by above average pH, nutrients, and texture. The other four areas are more typical of the 75 percent of the Amazon that is characterized by Oxisols and Ultisols, with well-drained but low pH and low levels of nutrients. Ponta de Pedras in Marajo Island, located in the estuary, is composed of upland Oxisols and floodplain alluvial soils. Igarape-Acu in the Bragantina region is characterized by both nutrient-poor Spodosols and Oxisols. Tome-Acu, south of Igarape-Acu, represents a mosaic of Oxisols and Ultisols. Yapu, in the Colombian Vaupes, is composed of patches of Spodosols and Oxisols. Three of the areas are colonization regions at various degrees of development: Altamira is a colonization front that opened up in 1971, whereas Tome-Acu was settled by a Japanese population in the 1930s, and Bragantina was settled in the early part of the twentieth century. Marajo (Ponta de Pedras) is the home of caboclos, whereas Yapu is home to Tukanoan Native American populations. In these study areas  slash-and-burn cultivation as well as plantation agriculture and mechanized agriculture are employed. Length of fallows vary in these communities. The two indigenous areas leave their land in longer fallow than do the three colonization areas, and the proportion of land prepared from secondary forests increases with length of settlement as the stock of mature forest declines over time.* [Contour Crafting Simulation Plan for Lunar Settlement Infrastructure Build-Up](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jgcr-f46h) - <p>Economically viable and reliable building systems and tool sets are being sought, examined, and tested for extraterrestrial habitat and infrastructure buildup. This proposal uses a unique architecture weaving an automated building technology called Contour Crafting (CC) with designs for assisting rapid buildup of an initial operational capability lunar base. Using CC technology, this proposal intends to draw up a detailed plan for a high-fidelity simulation at NASA's Desert Research and Technology Studies (D-RATS) facility, to construct certain crucial infrastructure elements in order to evaluate the merits, limitations, and feasibility of adapting and using the CC technology for extraterrestrial application. Elements suggested to be built and tested include roads, landing pads and aprons, shade walls, dust barriers, thermal and mm protection shields and dust-free platforms as well as other built-up structures utilizing the well known in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) strategy. Several unique systems including the Lunar Electric Rover, the unpressurized Chariot rover, the versatile light-weight crane, and Tri-Athlete cargo transporter as well as the habitat module mockups and a new generation of spacesuits are undergoing coordinated tests at NASA's D-RATS. This proposal intends to draw up a detailed synergetic plan to utilize these maturing systems coupled with the CC fabrication technology, tailored for swift and reliable lunar infrastructure development. This proposal intends to increase astronaut safety, improve buildup performance, ameliorate lunar dust interference and concerns, and attempts to reduce time-to-commission, all in an economic manner. As part of this proposal, a figure-of-merit methodology will be created and employed to gain some quantitative insight into the efficiency of using the CC technology to augment these other systems already in place.</p>* [Electrochemical Detection of Biological Catalysts as Signatures of Life](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f992-x33k) - The enzyme trypsin is chosen as a detection target due to its ubiquity in Earth biology. Trypsin catalyzes the break down of proteins through a catalytic triad consisting of histidine, aspartate and serine. The proposed sensor works by the detection of proteolytic cleavage of a redox-active tag. It is comprised of two gold electrodes. The first gold electrode houses a sensor probe, in this case a substrate peptide. The second electrode is a collector electrode that will detect the product of peptide cleavage. A methylene-labeled substrate peptide is self-assembled on a gold electrode using a thiol linkage. Any remaining accessible area of the electrode is then “blocked” or backfilled with an alkanethiol, which acts as an insulator and forces the peptide to stand up and form a close-packed structure on the gold surface. In this close-packed configuration, the peptide is accessible to the catalytic reaction with trypsin. Trypsin cleaves the peptide and releases the methylene blue terminus. A characteristic redox signature of methylene blue is detected at the second electrode using cyclic voltammetry and/or square wave voltammetry. Electrodes will be fabricated as 2 gold band electrodes on an inert substrate using a shadow mask and gold evaporation. While not required for proof of concept sensing, a simple fluidic channel will be added over the electrodes to demonstrate future integration ease with the ARC Universal Sample Processor for Life on Icy Worlds (SPLIce).* [Digital Array Gas Radiometer (DAGR), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6kdj-9vk6) - The innovation proposed here is a digital array gas radiometer (DAGR), a
new design for a gas filter correlation radiometer (GFCR) to accurately
measure and monitor CO2, CO, CH4, N2O and other key trace gases in the
boundary layer from space, aircraft or ground-based platforms. GFCR is a
well-known and proven technology for trace gas detection and monitoring.
However, its effectiveness in downlooking applications has been limited,
primarily because variations in surface albedo degrade the performance.
Our DAGR approach builds on traditional GFCR concepts and combines
several new key elements: two-dimensional detector arrays, pupil imaging
(imaging the aperture), and a novel calibration approach.  With these
enhancements and appropriate signal processing, the DAGR design
overcomes the historical limitations of GFCR in downlooking
applications.  In addition, this design significantly boosts the
sensitivity and expands the dynamic range traditionally available to
these sensors.  Finally, the innovation provides a calibration technique
that nearly eliminates errors due to detector drift effects.  The result
will be a compact, static, robust system that can accurately measure
important boundary layer species from a variety of platforms.* [Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5ghh-gt3j) - Given the extended duration of future missions and the isolated, extreme and confined environments, there is the possibility that behavioral conditions and mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) will develop. The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool that unobtrusively integrates all available behavioral measures collected during a mission to provide a dashboard of behavioral health indicators. These indicators will be placed within the context of quantitatively-tracked mission stressors to provide meaningful feedback to astronauts, and possibly the Operational Psychology Group and Flight Surgeons responsible for behavioral health support. The result of this project through Phase II will be a system prototype that can be deployed in space analog environments for validation testing and ultimately deployed on ISS and lunar missions. The critical need for an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP Integrated Research Plan (July 2009) gap BMED3. During Phase I, we will perform an assessment of behavioral health monitoring technologies and develop an engineering requirements document and detailed technical plans to implement during Phase II (Phase I TRL of 3).* [The DEEP Project: DEtecting Extraterrestrial Piezophiles in Ocean World Analogs](https://data.nasa.gov/d/gmte-fzu3) - OBJECTIVES :
Searching for extraterrestrial life necessitates a better understanding of the unique aspects of life detection in the high-pressure, deep oceans of Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. Generally, Earth’s oceans are similar to these extraterrestrial ocean worlds, but the closest analogs are deep-sea hydrothermal vents where microbes cycle nutrients and energy across a range of geochemical conditions. All of these ecosystems share one central physical parameter - high hydrostatic pressure - and piezophily is the common characteristic of life in the deep ocean. This high-pressure adaptation confers a competitive advantage to piezophiles, allowing them to access additional energy sources and expand habitable niches. While deep-sea microbes have been studied extensively, obligate piezophiles remain elusive, excluded by traditional decompressive sampling techniques.
Putative microbial communities in the deep oceans of Europa, Enceladus, and Titan would necessarily be piezophiles, therefore instrument development for upcoming missions to ocean worlds must include the ability to (1) detect life under high pressure conditions and/or (2) develop sample handling and life detection analysis protocols that mitigate the effects of sample decompression on analytical outcomes. The DEEP project will take advantage of a new high pressure sampling system (PUSH50) that allows for sample retrieval and manipulation without decompression. Here we propose a field research program to the Earth’s deepest hydrothermal vents, the Mid Cayman Rise, in order to develop high pressure sample handling protocols that optimize life detection in high pressure environments.
METHODOLOGY:
We will evaluate the fidelity of a range of life detection techniques on a variety of deep-sea vent samples for which in situ pressures have been maintained throughout the analytical process, and compare these to parallel samples that have been subjected to standard decompressive techniques. We aim to:
(1) identify the most robust suite of analyses for life detection in high pressure ecosystems;
(2) determine the instrumental/analytical requirements for in situ life detection on future ocean worlds missions.
In situ detection of microbial communities will include: quantification of cell and biomass; characterization of species and metabolic diversity; enrichment cultivation for high value target metabolisms;  and measurement of geochemical isotopic biosignatures. Many of these techniques can be (and are currently being) adapted for remote deployment on landers and rovers. Our proposed research will identify which of these techniques is most robust in high-pressure environments, optimize in situ analysis protocols for high-pressure ecosystems, and develop the technology necessary to implement these protocols in upcoming mission instrument packages
SIGNIFICANCE
This work addresses the following PSTAR Objectives. Science: We will elucidate the processes by which high pressure microbiomes are sensitive to traditional decompression sampling, characterize the metabolic and species diversity that has been obscured by these techniques, and develop new approaches to detecting these enigmatic piezophiles in high pressure environments. Technology: We will perform the first tests of a newly developed sampling system that maintains high in situ pressures during recovery. We will further develop the technology and protocols necessary for carrying out life detection under high pressures.* [Airborne Wide Area Imager for Wildfire Mapping and Detection, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4dp6-svkm) - An autonomous airborne imaging system for earth science research, disaster response, and fire detection is proposed.  The primary goal is to improve information to researchers and operations personnel.  By operating autonomously and with higher spatial resolution, the system will deliver a 3X to 4X reduction in operating costs compared to current systems.  The system uses a two color Quantum Well Infrared Photo detector (QWIP) to improve the accuracy of energy release from wildfires, thereby improving our understanding of the carbon cycle. 

The system includes a multi-sensor step-stare imager, position and attitude sensor, data communications link, and a data processing system with; feature extraction (such as fire detection), image geo-coding, and image compression.  

The sensor head is an innovative design combining high resolution framing devices (cameras) with a step-stare scanning mirror.  This configuration results in high spatial resolution imagery and wide area coverage.  The design of the sensor head is flexible allowing for a variety of imagers including; visible and IR cameras and/or hyperspectral sensors.  We envision several versions of the instrument, one weighing around 75 pounds and a smaller version weighing less than 15 pounds.* [Aeroelastic Uncertainty Analysis Toolbox, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/iwza-w6i4) - Flutter is a potentially explosive phenomenon that is the result of the simultaneous interaction of aerodynamic, structural, and inertial forces.  The analytical prediction of flutter in the transonic regime requires high fidelity simulation models that are computationally expensive.  Due to the computational demands, traditional uncertainty analysis is not often applied to flutter prediction, resulting in reduced confidence in the results.  This Phase I research is aimed at exploring methods to reduce the previous computational time limitations of traditional uncertainty analysis. To dramatically reduce the computational burden of uncertainty analysis, Systems Technology, Inc. proposes to investigate both the coupling of Design of Experiment (DOE) and Response Surface Methods (RSM), and the application of robust stability techniques, namely μ-analysis.  Using Reduced Order Models (ROM), the DOE/RSM and μ-analysis approaches will be compared to traditional Monte Carlo based stochastic simulation.  The result of the Phase I program will be to demonstrate the utility of the core elements of the Aeroelastic Uncertainty Analysis Toolbox (AUAT).  AUAT will contain multiple methods for addressing flutter uncertainty analysis, coupled with a state-of-the-art nonlinear aeroelastic code.* [Aero-Effected Distributed Adaptive Control of Flexible Aircraft Using Active Bleed, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/g3cu-9se9) - The proposed research focuses on the development of a new adaptive
control methodology for active control of wing aerodynamic shape to
effect distributed aerodynamic forces and moments for maneuvering and
stabilization of flexible airframes without moving control surfaces.
The new aero-effected flight control will be achieved using output
feedback adaptive control of distributed bleed across aerodynamic
surfaces, and is particularly suited for high-altitude long endurance
vehicles.  The large-area air bleed is driven by the inherent pressure
differences in flight across the pressure and suction wing surface, and
is regulated by low-power, surface-integrated louver valves.  Our
previous basic research in adaptive control has stressed the ability to
model and cancel the effect of uncertainty in output regulation.  We
also have developed methods for adaptation in the presence of nonlinear
actuation, which includes such effects as actuator saturation.  These
tools are currently being employed in the study of active flow control
using synthetic jet actuation, and will be adapted to the problems that
are unique to improving aeroelastic performance and active damping of
airframe-propulsion-structure interactions using distributed bleed.
Phase I will focus on advancing the state of the art in output feedback
adaptive control, and demonstration of the capability of aero-bleed to
control the dynamic modes of a flexible lifting surface.  These efforts
will be integrated in Phase-II by using an adaptive controller to
regulate a flexible wing flown in three degrees of freedom in a wind
tunnel experiment, using an existing traverse mechanism.  Another option
is to use Atair Aerospace's LEAPP vehicle to flight test a highly
flexible wing design.  Additional Phase-II and Phase-III transition
possibilities include coordinated research efforts with Boeing related
to the DARPA Vulture vehicle, and/or with AeroVironment related to the
Global Observer vehicle.* [FLEXible Damage Detection and Verification System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/eaq8-9x23) - <p>This&nbsp;project expands on the previously demonstrated Flat Surface Damage Detection System (FSDDS) capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Flexible Damage Detection and Verification&nbsp;System (FLEX-DDVS)&nbsp; is&nbsp;currently being formulated for consideration as an inspection/damage detection system for Orbital Debris (OD) and Micrometeoroid (MM) impacts and particle characterization capabilities for a potential International Space Station (ISS) ExPRESS Payload Adapter (ExPA) payload technology demonstration flight experiment.

the 5-100 kg size range. A potentially disruptive technology, small
satellites, which are low cost and can be delivered in months, are being
eyed as platforms for rapid demonstration of new technologies and even
important science missions. From NASA's recently launched PharmaSat
sub-10 kg free-flying nanosatellite, which has just successfully
completed an experiment that could help scientists better understand how
effectively drugs work in space, to potential future missions like
CRESPO, a ~100 kg microsatellite that will use a hyperspectral imager to
monitor the condition of more than 50&#37; of the Earth's coral reefs over a
2-year period, NASA is counting on these small satellites to deliver.  A
miniature PMB technology is widely applicable to small mechanisms and
will allow for a greater technological payoff with the next generation
of small satellite missions.  Honeybee Robotics is developing a small,
modular control moment gyroscope (CMG) technology for use on small
satellites. The life limiting and power driving aspect of this
technology as with any CMG or reaction wheel (RW), are the rotor
bearings which operate at 12,000 rpm. Honeybee Robotics proposes to
develop a miniature passive magnetic bearing (PMB) for small satellite
ACS components such as CMGs and RWs. This cross-cutting technology can
also be applied to any small mechanism that might benefit from low
parasitic torque, low induced vibration (IV), and long life. PMB
technology for small satellites will allow for a step increase in life
for their ACS subsystems. Enabling a small satellite mission lifetime of
15+ years rather than 1-3 years is a game-changing development that will
alter the way mission planners think about small satellite capabilities.
Prototype units will be integrated with our Tiny Operationally
Responsive CMG (TORC) technology to demonstrate the relative merits
compared to traditional ball bearings.* [Safe, High Specific Energy & Power Li-ion Cells](https://data.nasa.gov/d/facg-a3je) - <p>Today&rsquo;s best, <strong>safe</strong> commercial Li-ion cell designs achieve ~180 Wh/kg, ~500 Wh/L, and 400 W/kg. When accounting for the lightest (1.35) parasitic mass and smallest (2.0) parasitic volume factors of proven battery construction features, this means that at the battery level we need improvements of 144% and 170%, respectively, to achieve our specific energy (&gt;325 Wh/kg) and energy density (&gt;540 Wh/L) performance targets. Today&rsquo;s best commercial Li-ion cell designs offer the promise of a 47% and 82% improvements, respectively, over the State of the Art&nbsp;as shown in Fig. 1 below. Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t implement these new cell designs, which are safe enough for small consumer batteries but are unsafe for larger manned applications due to the high propensity for them to side wall rupture during thermal runaway.</p><p>This proposal offers to overcome this safety issue and enable significant progress towards the Evolving Mars Campaign (EMC) target. We seek our advanced battery designs to be passively propagation resistant to a single cell thermal runaway (TR). Key to this goal is greatly reducing the risk of side wall rupture of the hot thermal runaway products ejected from the cell (a.k.a., ejecta). Side wall ruptures create a blow torch effect&nbsp;which, when impinging on adjacent cells, causes nearly immediate TR propagation in a closely-packed battery designs.</p><p>The higher energy content (265 Wh/kg, 725 Wh/L) of the newer cell designs from LG, Panasonic, and Samsung have made them susceptible to side wall ruptures during thermal runaway, rather than venting through the intended vent path in the cell header. This is also due to higher reaction kinetics of the electrochemistry, thinner can walls, tight crimp enclosure of the cell header, and inadequate flow rate through the header vent. Tesla Motors was the first to recognize and address this issue by asking cell manufacturers to produce cell designs with bottom burst disc vents. &nbsp;However, those designs exclusively for Tesla and not available to others. Thus, we must stay with lower performing cell designs or implement structural supporting features for the cells in the battery designs. Both options limit battery achievable specific energy to at best 133 Wh/kg. Being able to safely implement the newest cell designs with bottom vents will enable reaching 196 Wh/kg at the battery level. This 47% improvement would save 24 lbs per each 4 kWh MPCV battery or 96 lbs per MPCV flight or enable 1 hour flight run time for the X-57 electric plane by saving 282 lbs from their 46 kWh battery. Similar volume savings impacts are possible by retiring the side wall rupture risk, because it allows cells to be safely nested together more efficiently. These sizable mass/volume savings and safety improvements are aligned with the needs of the EMC.</p><p>Safe, higher performing batteries are well aligned with EMC needs for high specific power, high specific energy batteries, long life batteries, and deep space suit specific energies &nbsp;&gt;235 Wh/kg.</p><p>The required vent paths are achieved by scoring a groove pattern in bottom of the mild steel can. Although they look simple, achieving a reliably performing bottom vent is not trivial. Weaker designs are excessively susceptible to corrosion, leakage, damage, and poor performance uniformity. The important question that this research project will answer is whether our design will significantly reduce the side wall rupture risk without significant limitations, such as leakage, corrosion, and excessive performance variations.</p><p>The scope of the project includes conducting TR tests on similar cells with and without the bottom vent to show the merits of the bottom vent feature. Just 3 months ago, Sony Energy became the first to make a commercially available, high performing design with a bottom vent. We have taken delivery of 400 such SONY cells last month.

This network represents the only coordinated and standardized program of observations using standard measurement protocols designed to observe and detect decadal changes in the dynamics of seasonal thawing and freezing in high-latitude soils. The Intellectual Merit of this study lies in the need for long-term time series of active layer depth, ground temperature, and thaw settlement measurements at the same locations and across diverse terrain types and regions in order to identify scales of spatial variation, establish trends, and validate models.

The active layer thickness is measured by physical probing on grids ranging in size from 100 to 1000 meters, by probing at a single point or along transects or from permanently installed frost tubes and soil temperature cables. Sites include several coastal to inland transects in North America, a longitudinal array of sites across Eurasia, and individual sites in several mid-latitude, mountainous regions. The majority of the sites are in arctic tundra regions consisting of fine grained sediments. Bouldery and rocky sites in mountains are being added to the network primarily in Europe as part of the EC Permafrost and Climate in Europe (PACE) project. CALM is being considered as the part of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). 

CALM is closely affiliated with the International Permafrost Association (IPA), several IPA working groups, and the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). The current protocol for observing the active layer thickness is given in the published ITEX Manual and on the ITEX and IPA Web sites. These activities are part of the IPA Global Geocryological Database (GGD). 

A map on the CAPS CD-ROM illustrates the locations of the 130 sites. A comprehensive metadata file for all sites is available. The CAPS CD-ROM contains detailed metadata and summary data and can be ordered from the Order Data Button and the data can be obtained from the Order External Data Button.* [Broad-bandwidth Metamaterial Antireflection Coatings for Sub-Millimeter Astronomy and CMB Foreground Removal](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5k6g-z8wq) - Sub-millimeter observations are crucial for answering questions about star and galaxy formation; understanding galactic dust foregrounds; and for removing these foregrounds to detect the faint signature of inflationary gravitational waves in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Achieving these goals requires improved, broad-band antireflection coated lenses and half-wave plates (HWPs).  These optical elements will significantly boost the sensitivity and capability of future sub-millimeter and CMB missions.

We propose to develop wide-bandwidth metamaterial antireflection coatings for silicon lenses and sapphire HWPs with 3:1 ratio bandwidth that are scalable across the sub-millimeter band from 300 GHz to 3 THz.  This is an extension of our successful work on saw cut metamaterial AR coatings for silicon optics at millimeter wave lengths. These, and the proposed coatings consist of arrays of sub-wavelength scale features cut into optical surfaces that behave like simple dielectrics.  We have demonstrated saw cut 3:1 bandwidth coatings on silicon lenses, but these coatings are limited to the millimeter wave band by the limitations of dicing saw machining.  The crucial advance needed to extend these broad band coatings throughout the sub-millimeter band is the development of laser cut graded index metamaterial coatings.  The proposed work includes developing the capability to fabricate these coatings, optimizing the design of these metamaterials, fabricating and testing prototype lenses and HWPs, and working with the PIPER collaboration to achieve a sub-orbital demonstration of this technology.  The proposed work will develop potentially revolutionary new high performance coatings for the sub-millimeter bands, and cary this technology to TRL 7 paving the way for its use in space.  We anticipate that there will be a wide range of  applications for these coatings on future NASA balloons and satellites.* [Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) on ISS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/s6vw-3v2s) - The Psychomotor Vigilance (PVT) Self Test (operational name on International Space Station (ISS) is Reaction Self Test (RST)) is intended to provide astronauts in spaceflight with objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in vigilant attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, as well as recording their subjective ratings of workload, sleep timing and quality, tiredness, fatigue, and stress. The PVT Self Test is suited for repeated use in spaceflight because unlike other cognitive tests, it is very brief (less than 5 minutes) while being free of learning effects and aptitude differences that make interpretation of other cognitive measures difficult.     <p></p>
Our initial Reaction Self Test study evaluated 24 astronauts, before, during, and after 6-month missions on the International Space Station (ISS). A total of 2,856 RST evaluations were obtained from 21 astronauts participating in 6-month ISS missions.    <p></p>
To determine whether there were continuing changes in Reaction Self Test outcomes for ISS missions greater than 6-month duration, a study was conducted on the RST outcomes of N=2 participants in the initial 1-year mission (i.e., one US astronaut and one Russian cosmonaut). The following are the objectives (specific aims) of the project for the 1-year mission. The US astronaut and Russian cosmonaut were evaluated within the 1-year mission, and relative to data from the N=21 astronauts in 6-month missions.      <p></p>
1)	Evaluate whether there were changes in sleep duration and/or sleep quality within the 1-year mission (i.e., first 6 months compared to the second 6 months of the 1-year mission), and differences in these outcomes between the 1-year and 6-month missions.    <p></p>
2)	Evaluate whether there were changes in psychomotor speed, performance lapses, and premature responses on the Brief Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT-B) within the 1-year mission (i.e., first 6 months compared to the second 6 months of the 1-year mission), and differences in these outcomes between the 1-year and 6-month missions.    <p></p>
3)	Evaluate whether there were changes in subjective ratings of sleepiness, fatigue, tiredness, physical exhaustion, workload, and stress within the 1-year mission (i.e., first 6 months compared to the second 6 months of the 1-year mission), and differences in these outcomes between the 1-year and 6-month missions.    <p></p>
4)	To investigate changes in the intake of caffeine and medications within the 1-year mission (i.e., first 6 months compared to the second 6 months of the 1-year mission), and differences in these outcomes between the 1-year and 6-month missions. <p></p>* [Integrated Structural Health Sensors for Inflatable Space Habitats, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/aq72-xrac) - Luna proposes to continue development of integrated high-definition fiber optic sensors (HD-FOS) and carbon nanotube (CNT)-graphene piezoresistive sensors for inflatable space habitat materials to enable full coverage structural health monitoring (SHM) and impact detection. Inflatable habitats are key to reducing the weight of space structures, enabling future long term missions and planetary habitation. There is a need for monitoring the structural health of these habitats, as many of the methods used on earth are not applicable to the space environment or the materials used. To accomplish this goal, Luna has teamed with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) who is a leader in the development of CNT sensor technology. Luna is teaming with an established manufacturer to fabricate a sub-scale inflatable structure with integrated SHM sensors which will enable thorough characterization of the approach. During Phase I, the team successfully demonstrated damage detection in an inflatable prototype as well as dynamic impact detection of soft goods layers with the technologies. Phase II will focus on increasing the TRL of the sensing technologies and preparing for transition into future NASA missions. Phase III will focus on commercializing the technology with NASA and NASA affiliates.* [Human Research Program](https://data.nasa.gov/d/j97r-4atq) - &lt;p&gt;Strategically, the HRP conducts research and technology development that: 1) enables the development or modification of Agency-level human health and performance standards by the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO) and 2) provides Human Exploration Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) with methods of meeting those standards in the design, development, and operation of mission systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HRP research focuses on reducing crew health and performance risks for exploration missions.&amp;nbsp; In addition, HRP research gathers the data necessary to understand and mitigate the long-term health risks to the crew, to allow the update of specific crew health standards for each mission scenario, to support crew selection, and to address any rehabilitation requirements.&amp;nbsp; The OCHMO owns and sets the standards upon which the HRP research efforts are based.&amp;nbsp; The Transition to Medical Practice process defined by the OCHMO is used to review the HRP deliverable countermeasures and technologies prior to their operational use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HRP technology development advances medical care and countermeasure systems for exploration and vehicle development programs&amp;rsquo; missions.&amp;nbsp; The HRP also develops and matures operational concepts to inform requirements for the design and operation of space vehicles and habitats needed for exploration.&amp;nbsp; This includes requirements for displays and controls, internal environments, operations planning, habitability, and methodologies for maintaining crew physical and mental health as well as physical and cognitive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HRP is managed at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) and comprised of six research and technology development projects.&amp;nbsp; These projects provide the program knowledge and capabilities to conduct research addressing the human health and performance risks as well as advancing the readiness levels of technology and countermeasures to the point of transfer to the customer programs and organizations.&amp;nbsp; The six projects within the HRP are referred to as Program Elements throughout this document.&amp;nbsp; Each Element is managed at the JSC with research and technology development expertise provided by JSC, Ames Research Center (ARC), Glenn Research Center (GRC), the Langley Research Center (LaRC), and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), as well as other Agencies, institutions and organizations identified in the following Element descriptions.&amp;nbsp; The six Elements are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Space Radiation (SR) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The SR Element performs investigations to develop the scientific basis to accurately predict and mitigate health risks from the space radiation environment.&amp;nbsp; This knowledge yields recommendations to permissible exposure limits, assessment/projection tools/models of crew risk from radiation exposure, and models/tools to assess vehicle design for radiation protection.&amp;nbsp; The SR Element conducts research using accelerator-based simulation of space radiation.&amp;nbsp; The SR Element explores and develops countermeasures to the deleterious effects of radiation on human health.&amp;nbsp; The LaRC and ARC contribute to the SR Element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The BHP Element identifies and characterizes the behavioral and performance risks associated with training, living and working in space, and returning to Earth.&amp;nbsp; The BHP Element develops strategies, tools, and technologies to mitigate these risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; The ExMC Element is responsible for defining requirements for crew health maintenance during exploration missions, developing treatment scenarios, extrapolating from the scenarios t* [Human Performance Metrics for Spacesuit Evaluation](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bmc6-3qjz) - Introduction: Human spaceflight and exploration beyond low-earth orbit requires providing crewmembers life support systems in various extreme environments, such as microgravity, the moon, and Mars, in the form of extravehicular activity (EVA) spacesuits. Critical to mission success is the ability for crewmembers to successfully perform a series of mission-related operational tasks while mitigating risks to health and injury. Therefore, methods for evaluating suited human performance and spacesuit design need to incorporate complex mission related dynamics, such as operationally relevant tasks. Important to suited EVA performance is minimizing the risk to crew health to avoid crewmember overexertion and injury and ensure mission success. The proposed method will develop and validate quantitative metrics for decisions that are currently made qualitatively with regard to a spacesuit design's risk to astronaut health and injury during EVA operations.

Problem Statement: There are currently no quantitative methods for computing the health and injury risk to suited crewmembers in operationally relevant settings. Understanding the mobility and performance needs of astronauts during EVA aids in mitigating the jeopardy to crew member health. This requires a quantitative toolset for comparing and evaluating current and future human spacesuit performance as a means of designing innovative future spacesuits that mitigate these risks to crewmember health.

Research Plan: A standardized method for evaluating EVA performance and injury risk provides methodology for innovating and robustness for defining the requirements of future spacesuit systems. Inclusion of user and decision maker needs in the evaluation processes maximizes usability, understanding, and implementation of novel evaluation methods, expediting the design iterations of future systems and the understanding of human spacesuit performance. To this end, the specific aims of this study are as follows:

Aim 1: Use of cognitive task analysis to determine a series of operationally relevant assessments, tasks, needs for decision makers during the evaluation of human spacesuit performance in the context of defining spacesuit design requirements for minimizing risk to crew health. 

Aim 2: Creation of appropriate new performance metrics and data acquisition modalities to quantify performance during operationally relevant tasks. 

Aim 3: Validation of operationally relevant, quantitative performance metrics with operational decision makers.

Impact: The proposed framework enables a standardized method to determine an astronaut's risk to health and injury during EVA operations. These metrics can then be used by suit design engineers to make decisions on the appropriate Do Not Harm requirements for current and future spacesuit designs.* [Monitoring of Thermal Protection Systems using Robust Self-Organizing Optical Fiber Sensing Networks](https://data.nasa.gov/d/53nn-ii6a) - <p>Effective thermal protection systems are crucial for spacecraft or future hypersonic transports re-entering the atmosphere. Micro-meteoroids and orbital debris (MMODs) are an increasingly dangerous problem for near-Earth operations. This system uses a network of optical fiber sensors to map heat shield strains and temperatures using decentralized "agent based" algorithms in a sensor network.<p/><p>Virtually every program across the agency needs the ability to detect and assess the impact of MMOD.  We are developing and demonstrating robust, dynamically-reconfigurable optical fiber sensor networks for on-orbit damage detection.   Objectives The project has the following objectives: a)    Development, evaluation and demonstration of a dynamically reconfigurable optical fiber sensing network that is interrogated using the optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) technique. Such a system will substantially reduce the susceptibility of optical fiber sensing systems to failure in the event of fiber breakage. b)    Development and demonstration of a distributed, self-organized approach to configuration control of an optical fiber sensing network that is interrogated using the optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) technique. c)    Demonstrate fiber optic distributed strain and temperature sensing on a small-scale heat shield carrier structure. d)    Development and demonstration of a method for determining optimal sensor placements with the aim of maintaining adequate accuracy of impact and damage location. e)    Development and demonstration of acoustic detection and thermal evaluation of impact damage to a thermal protection system (TPS) attached to the carrier structure of goal c) above.   Approach This work will be carried out jointly by Armstrong Flight Research Center and CSIRO Materials Science & Engineering, Sydney, Australia. It will leverage off developments from earlier NASA/CSIRO work on structural health monitoring, in particular on the development of a distributed multi-agent system demonstrator for impact detection and damage characterization, which was co-funded by CSIRO. Principle of combined acoustic emission/thermal monitoring of TPS The general aim of this work is to develop and demonstrate a prototype structural health monitoring system for thermal protection systems (TPS) that incorporates piezoelectric acoustic emission (AE) sensors to detect the occurrence and location of damaging impacts, and an optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor network to evaluate the effect of detected damage on the thermal conductivity of the TPS material. Following detection of an impact, the TPS would be exposed to a heat source, possibly the sun, and the temperature distribution on the inner surface in the vicinity of the impact measured by the FBG network. A similar procedure could also be carried out as a screening test immediately prior to re-entry. The implications of any detected anomalies in the measured temperature distribution will be evaluated for their significance in relation to the performance of the TPS during re-entry. Structure of optical fiber network An important aspect of this proposal is the development of a robust, electronically-reconfigurable FBG network that employs the optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) technique to measure temperature-induced strains in the Bragg gratings. The network will have a high degree of redundancy to ensure its continued effectiveness in the event of damage to one or more fiber segments. Light will be routed around damaged fiber segments, so that the network can continue to operate even when some regions of it are damaged. Network routing/configuration could be: i)        controlled from a central processor, using wired or wireless communications; or ii)      determined using a distributed, self-organized approach to control of the sensor network. This approach has been outlined in a recent Contractor Report (Scott & Price, NASA/CR-2007-215092).

We also propose to develop non-distorting X-ray reflective multilayer coatings for use above 80 keV. Our specific research objectives are: (a) develop two-dimensional control of film deposition and erosion to correct both low- and mid-frequency surface height errors in cylindrical, thin-shell mirror substrates, and (b) develop high-efficiency, non-distorting, zero net-stress, and stress balanced, reflective multilayer coatings for use above 80 keV.* [Ultrasound Fracture Diagnosis in Space](https://data.nasa.gov/d/yjsd-3znq) - This ground-based proposal accumulated high-level clinical evidence on the sensitivity and specificity of point of care ultrasound performed by expert and novice users for the rapid diagnosis of musculoskeletal injuries. This proposal developed preliminary educational methodologies to provide just-in-time training of novice users by creating multi-media training tools and imaging procedures for non expert operators. Expanded diagnostic use of ultrasound is being substantiated for the diagnosis of specific musculoskeletal injuries deemed possible in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and future exploration-class missions. This final report summarizes the sensitivity and specificity of non-expert performed musculoskeletal ultrasound to diagnose acute injuries.     
This Final Report covers Specific Aim I and II in the cooperative agreement:    
1. Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for bone fractures, associated muscle trauma, and fracture healing in a ground-based study at an academic medical center.    
EXPERT OPERATORS: We identified patients with potential musculoskeletal injuries in an urban, Level 1 trauma center based on mechanism of injury and the presenting complaint. Potential subjects were given a summary of the study and invited to participate following informed consent. A GE Logiq-e portable ultrasound device with a 12 MHz linear probe was used for the ultrasound investigations in this study.  The initial musculoskeletal (MSK) evaluations were performed and interpreted by ultrasound experts with extensive experience in MSK ultrasound. These examinations were also used to fashion cue cards and short video based educational aids to allow non-expert operators to perform complex ultrasound examinations for the later investigations in Specific Aim II.  The examinations confirmed earlier investigations at our institution which have demonstrated a very high sensitivity and specificity for ultrasound when performed with a portable ultrasound machine by an expert. There were no false positive examinations in this study. There was one false negative in a non displaced, sub-capital fracture of the hip in an obese patient. This patient also had a negative X-ray and was found to have a fracture on a subsequent MRI for continued pain.     
There were a number of additional soft tissue ultrasound examinations in this patient subgroup which showed soft tissue edema, hematoma formation, tendon-ligament tears, and foreign bodies.     
The analysis of this data set obtained and interpreted by MSK ultrasound experts suggests that  2D ultrasound provides a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of musculoskeletal trauma and that 3D or volumetric ultrasound is not necessary to obtain a correct diagnosis in experts' hands.     
NOVICE OPERATOR:    
Over 850 patients were screened for enrollment in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital. Initial patient screening was done by Trauma Surgery or Emergency Medicine staff based on mechanism of injury, history, and presenting signs and symptoms suggestive of significant musculoskeletal injury.     
Informed consent was obtained and a localized ultrasound examination was completed prior to radiographic evaluation by minimally trained personnel using a 10.5 MHz linear probe. The ultrasound examination was initially done on the contra lateral, non-injured side to obtain a reference image and to optimize visualization and focal zone. The entire length of the bone was visualized with special attention to the injured area. A positive scan consisted of identification of cortical disruption or discontinuity. Secondary hematomas and muscular injury were also recorded. Routine radiographic imaging was then completed for comparison against the ultrasound examination.    
Demographic, anatomic, and radiographic information was collected for correlation to the ultrasonographic findings. A diagnostic scoring sheet with patient and exam-specific data was filled out by the operator* [LBA-ECO LC-09 Soil Composition and Structure in the Brazilian Amazon: 1992-1995](https://data.nasa.gov/d/2vc5-6iuh) - This data set reports basic soil structure and composition information for five Amazonian research sites: Altamira, Bragantina, Tome-Acu, and Ponta de Pedras, all four in the state of Para, Brazil; and one site in Yapu, Colombia. Soil characteristics reported for all five study sites include cation information (e.g., H, Al, Mg, K, Na, S), percent of soil C, N, and organic matter, soil texture/composition and color, pH, and land use history. Soil bulk density and tons of carbon/ha are reported for only three of the study sites: Altamira, Bragantina, and Tome-Acu. All of the data are provided in one comma-separated data file.The five study areas represent characteristic differences in soil fertility and a range of land uses typical of the Amazon region. One of these areas, Altamira, is characterized by above average pH, nutrients, and texture. The other four areas are more typical of the 75 percent of the Amazon that is characterized by Oxisols and Ultisols, with well-drained but low pH and low levels of nutrients. Ponta de Pedras in Marajo Island, located in the estuary, is composed of upland Oxisols and floodplain alluvial soils. Igarape-Acu in the Bragantina region is characterized by both nutrient-poor Spodosols and Oxisols. Tome-Acu, south of Igarape-Acu, represents a mosaic of Oxisols and Ultisols. Yapu, in the Colombian Vaupes, is composed of patches of Spodosols and Oxisols. Three of the areas are colonization regions at various degrees of development: Altamira is a colonization front that opened up in 1971, whereas Tome-Acu was settled by a Japanese population in the 1930s, and Bragantina was settled in the early part of the twentieth century. Marajo (Ponta de Pedras) is the home of caboclos, whereas Yapu is home to Tukanoan Native American populations. In these study areas  slash-and-burn cultivation as well as plantation agriculture and mechanized agriculture are employed. Length of fallows vary in these communities. The two indigenous areas leave their land in longer fallow than do the three colonization areas, and the proportion of land prepared from secondary forests increases with length of settlement as the stock of mature forest declines over time.* [Contour Crafting Simulation Plan for Lunar Settlement Infrastructure Build-Up](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jgcr-f46h) - <p>Economically viable and reliable building systems and tool sets are being sought, examined, and tested for extraterrestrial habitat and infrastructure buildup. This proposal uses a unique architecture weaving an automated building technology called Contour Crafting (CC) with designs for assisting rapid buildup of an initial operational capability lunar base. Using CC technology, this proposal intends to draw up a detailed plan for a high-fidelity simulation at NASA's Desert Research and Technology Studies (D-RATS) facility, to construct certain crucial infrastructure elements in order to evaluate the merits, limitations, and feasibility of adapting and using the CC technology for extraterrestrial application. Elements suggested to be built and tested include roads, landing pads and aprons, shade walls, dust barriers, thermal and mm protection shields and dust-free platforms as well as other built-up structures utilizing the well known in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) strategy. Several unique systems including the Lunar Electric Rover, the unpressurized Chariot rover, the versatile light-weight crane, and Tri-Athlete cargo transporter as well as the habitat module mockups and a new generation of spacesuits are undergoing coordinated tests at NASA's D-RATS. This proposal intends to draw up a detailed synergetic plan to utilize these maturing systems coupled with the CC fabrication technology, tailored for swift and reliable lunar infrastructure development. This proposal intends to increase astronaut safety, improve buildup performance, ameliorate lunar dust interference and concerns, and attempts to reduce time-to-commission, all in an economic manner. As part of this proposal, a figure-of-merit methodology will be created and employed to gain some quantitative insight into the efficiency of using the CC technology to augment these other systems already in place.</p>* [Electrochemical Detection of Biological Catalysts as Signatures of Life](https://data.nasa.gov/d/f992-x33k) - The enzyme trypsin is chosen as a detection target due to its ubiquity in Earth biology. Trypsin catalyzes the break down of proteins through a catalytic triad consisting of histidine, aspartate and serine. The proposed sensor works by the detection of proteolytic cleavage of a redox-active tag. It is comprised of two gold electrodes. The first gold electrode houses a sensor probe, in this case a substrate peptide. The second electrode is a collector electrode that will detect the product of peptide cleavage. A methylene-labeled substrate peptide is self-assembled on a gold electrode using a thiol linkage. Any remaining accessible area of the electrode is then “blocked” or backfilled with an alkanethiol, which acts as an insulator and forces the peptide to stand up and form a close-packed structure on the gold surface. In this close-packed configuration, the peptide is accessible to the catalytic reaction with trypsin. Trypsin cleaves the peptide and releases the methylene blue terminus. A characteristic redox signature of methylene blue is detected at the second electrode using cyclic voltammetry and/or square wave voltammetry. Electrodes will be fabricated as 2 gold band electrodes on an inert substrate using a shadow mask and gold evaporation. While not required for proof of concept sensing, a simple fluidic channel will be added over the electrodes to demonstrate future integration ease with the ARC Universal Sample Processor for Life on Icy Worlds (SPLIce).* [Digital Array Gas Radiometer (DAGR), Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/6kdj-9vk6) - The innovation proposed here is a digital array gas radiometer (DAGR), a
new design for a gas filter correlation radiometer (GFCR) to accurately
measure and monitor CO2, CO, CH4, N2O and other key trace gases in the
boundary layer from space, aircraft or ground-based platforms. GFCR is a
well-known and proven technology for trace gas detection and monitoring.
However, its effectiveness in downlooking applications has been limited,
primarily because variations in surface albedo degrade the performance.
Our DAGR approach builds on traditional GFCR concepts and combines
several new key elements: two-dimensional detector arrays, pupil imaging
(imaging the aperture), and a novel calibration approach.  With these
enhancements and appropriate signal processing, the DAGR design
overcomes the historical limitations of GFCR in downlooking
applications.  In addition, this design significantly boosts the
sensitivity and expands the dynamic range traditionally available to
these sensors.  Finally, the innovation provides a calibration technique
that nearly eliminates errors due to detector drift effects.  The result
will be a compact, static, robust system that can accurately measure
important boundary layer species from a variety of platforms.* [Ground-Based Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Cumulative Station Position Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/767v-9ehg) - Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Data (multi-day files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis to compute station position solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. The IDS Analysis Center Coordinator combines these individual AC solutions to generate a long-term DORIS position and velocity cumulative solution through a piecewise linear (position+velocity) model to describe the station motions. The cumulative position and velocity solution is obtained from the stacking of the weekly solution files and is then aligned to the current ITRF. The residuals of this stacking are of particular interest since they depict non-linear station motions. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/DORIS/DORIS_product_holdings.html.* [Monthly Climate Data for Selected USGS HCDN Sites, 1951-1990](https://data.nasa.gov/d/82eh-jb5c) - Time series of monthly minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were derived for 1337 watersheds in the conterminous United States for sites found in the national streamflow database, termed the hydroclimatologic data network (HCDN), developed by Slack et al. (1993a,b). Estimates were derived for the years 1951-1990.This HCDN data set consists of records of average daily streamflow at 1553 sites located throughout the United States. The data meet certain measurement accuracy criterion outlined by Slack et al. (1993). The HCDN contains river flows from 1874 to 1988, with an average record length of 44 years. The streamflow data included in the HCDN is purported to be relatively free from anthropogenic influences and the accuracy ratings of these records are at least rated good per USGS standards. A subset of the HCDN streamflow sites from 1337 watersheds with at least 10 years of record length was used. This subset includes 1376 HCDN sites.The climate characteristic estimates of temperature and precipitation were estimated using the PRISM (Daly et al. 1994, 1997) climate analysis system as described in Vogel, et al. 1999.Estimates of monthly potential evaporation were obtained using a method introduced by Hargreaves and Samani (1982) which is based on monthly time series of average minimum and maximum temperature data along with extraterrestrial solar radiation. Extraterrestrial solar radiation was estimated for each HCDN basin by computing the solar radiation over 0.1 degree grids using the method introduced by Duffie and Beckman (1980) and then summing those estimates for each river basin. This process is described in Sankarasubramanian, Vogel, and Limbrunner, 2001.The data files are organized in directories by parameter, Tmax, Tmin, Pre, and PET, and contain 18 subdirectories representing the 18 HCDN regions. Each region subdirectory contains data files for the monthly time series of respective hydroclimate attributes (Tmax, Tmin, Precipitation, and PET) for the individual HCDN sites in that region for the years 1951-1990. All files are in space delimited ASCII format.* [Fire Danger Assessment System](https://data.nasa.gov/d/998c-mrww) - <p>A fire danger dataset for the continental US based on satellite hydrology information, this can be updated monthly and used operationally to distribute fire response resources. &nbsp;The project involved working together with fire-community end-users and developing a data product that can be utilized for future NASA research solicitations in hydrology, disasters, and applied sciences programs, as well as other agency (e.g. NOAA) program solicitations.</p><p>Quantify fire-moisture relationships. &nbsp;At seasonal to annual time-scales, we will use the published relationships between sea surface temperatures and regional fire likelihood as a baseline predictor for a good or bad fire year [Chen et al., 2016], and extend this methodology to include terrestrial water storage information from GRACE. &nbsp;That long-term prediction will then be combined with a seasonal-to-monthly predictive approach based on surface moisture conditions [Rousseau et al., 2015]. &nbsp;We also will use GRACE-assimilated land surface model outputs of surface soil moisture (top 2.5 cm) at 12.5-km resolution in the continental US. &nbsp;At sub-seasonal time-scales (i.e. daily to monthly) we will use assimilated soil moisture and AIRS VPD to estimate future fire risk [e.g., Stavros et al., 2014]. &nbsp;The GFED4 fire occurrence and burned area database [Giglio et al., 2013], which has several significant improvements compared with earlierGFED versions, will be used with the predictor variables in a multi-regression approach that employs efficient parameterization. This results in a multi-variable algorithm for global seasonal/monthly/weekly fire danger. &nbsp;Two additional exploratory analyses will be undertaken if time permits: (i) Investigation of whether canopy and ground fuel moisture can be predicted using the SMAP vegetation water content product; (ii) Investigation of ECOSTRESS data usefulness and predictive viability. &nbsp;Both are subject to data quality and availability limitations. A remote sensing-based methodology for wall-to-wall fuel moisture levels would be extremely valuable to fire managers for optimizing suppression and firefighting resources.</p>* [Ground-Based Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Station Position Time Series Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/7w6s-762z) - Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Data (multi-day files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis and after producing the weekly SINEX files using the current ITRF, compute station position time series solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. The IDS Analysis Center Coordinator combines these individual AC solutions to generate the official IDS DORIS network time series solution in the IDS STCD (Station Coordinates Difference) format. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/DORIS/DORIS_product_holdings.html.* [Physiological and Environmental Sensor Skin Stamp](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ikug-mivp) - <p>Future exploration missions will require astronauts to autonomously monitor physiological and atmospheric conditions. Recent technological advances in the developing field of wearable technologies has led to designs capable of measuring atmospheric conditions in addition to the more common physiological monitoring uses; however, these separate capabilities have not been packaged into a single monitoring system with real-time feedback.&nbsp; A conformable and flexible &quot;skin stamp&quot; instrumented with electronics and sensors to measure atmospheric conditions and physiological health during daily exercise, EVA, and exploration tasks would provide an easy to implement method to protect astronauts&rsquo; health and save cost and space during all phases of the Journey to Mars. Additionally, advancement of this technology could be used to immediately enhance ISS medical monitoring capabilities and in other isolated environments such as military training and off shore rigging.</p>
 <p>Advancing human exploration beyond low earth orbit and ISS will require improved and more autnomous health monitoring systems, highlighting the importance of integrating multiple medical devices in one platform with focus on early detection of remediable conditions. Skin-mounted biosensors provide the capability to monitor indicators of physical performance and fatigue (i.e. heart rate, hydration, temperature, oxygen saturation).&nbsp; NASA exploration needs requirements doucment specfically calls out&nbsp;capabilities for environmental monitoring to quickly detect changes that could result in an unfavorable habitation. As an example,&nbsp;daily exercise sessions may stress the Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) Systems on exploration vehicles due to heat generation, sweat production, and carbon dioxide accumulation. Accordingly, there is a need to develop sensors that can simultaneously monitor physiological health and atmospheric conditions (i.e. temperature, humidity, gas concentrations) during Mars proving-ground and Earth-Independent missions. The proposed wearable &ldquo;skin stamp&rdquo; multi-parametric sensor will be a novel design with dual-use technology in mind to monitor both biomedical and atmospheric conditions in a single platform</p>

<p>The proposed &quot;skin stamp&quot; sensor will be designed, fabricated, and tested as a collaborative effort between SK and University of Houston Engineering Department. The teams expertise in sensor and materials design, physiological monitoring and testing, and exploration are necessary to successfully develop a suite of sensors in a single platform that is optimized for exploration within the budget and time constraints of this ICA. We propose to strategically assemble a suite of atmospheric and physiological monitoring sensors in a conformable skin mounted fabric and integrate key design features including ease of use, single platform, high data quality, durability, and real-time monitoring. We will leverage previous high-performance flexible electronic material assemblies developed by UH. The hardware will undergo rigorous evaluations at different environmental temperatures.</p>

<p>The product of this effort will be a novel prototype multi-sensor skin patch that allows for accurate, real-time physiological and atmospheric monitoring in a single platform design. The first 8 weeks will focus on sensor development, followed by 4 weeks of engineering evaluations, and 4 weeks of human testing. Additional products will include a final report, poster presentation, and JTWG out-briefing that detail the innovative design and potential physiological benefits to astronauts as well as other scenarios requiring remote medical care such as military personnel or off-shore workers.</p>

<p>Following successful design, fabrication, and testing, this novel skin patch sensor will be shared with NASA&rsquo;s exploration medical team and MPCV design group. Additional funding will be sought via IR* [Individualized Stress Detection System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/t8xw-fiua) - Given the extended duration of future missions and the isolated, extreme and confined environments, there is the possibility that stress-related behavioral conditions and mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) will develop. The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an integrated system that will track physiological signals (heart rate and heart rate variability) and behavioral signals (sleep wake patterns) to detect chronic stress, hyperarousal, and insomnia during space missions. This project will deliver both the sensor hardware and signal processing software needed for the real-time data collection and integration with other behavioral health monitoring systems (e.g., Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool). The result of this project through Phase II will be a system that can be deployed in space analog environments for validation testing and ultimately deployed on ISS to assist astronauts and mission support personnel in the detection of astronaut chronic stress, hyperarousal, and insomnia. The critical need for an Individualized Stress Detection System has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP IRP Gap BMED3. During Phase I, we will perform an assessment of heart rate sensor and actigraphy technologies and develop engineering requirements and detailed technical plans to be implemented during Phase II (Phase I TRL of 3).* [Meteorologically Driven Dengue and Chikungunya Forecasts](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hjc4-hnk6) - The goal of this project is to incorporate weather forecasts and reported DF and ChikV case data into a disease transmission model to forecast disease case numbers in Caribbean countries. MSFC is a unique location where mature public health and meteorological expertise co-exists, positioning NASA to develop innovative capabilities that can aid public health officials in fighting disease outbreaks. Weather forecasts will drive the model. Prior weekly DV and ChikV case data will be used to re-parameterize the model so that the most up-to-date and relevant information informs the forecasts. Predictions will be evaluated against actual reported DF and ChikV case data. This project will produce a prototype for an innovative disease forecast system for use by public health agencies and officials.* [The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development.](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rp24-jkbu) - Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development and has been proposed as a gravisensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days. Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins chemokines IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules. Importantly 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity. Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs. Total RNA samples extracted from Pthrp+/+and -/- trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) exposed for 6 days to simulated 0g in Synthecon rotating cell or left 6 days in culture at 1g. Cells had either been treated with a pulsatile treatment (2 h/day) of PTHrP1-36 peptide (10-8M) or received a change in growth medium. In total: 8 different conditions with 2 replicates each i.e. Pthrp+/+ TOs at 0g or 1g with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment and Pthrp-/- TOs at 0g or 1 g,with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment.* [Online Detection, Isolation, and Remediation of Flight Software Faults, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kre6-ry4f) - Increasingly, critical flight functionality is implemented in software, but traditional (integrated) vehicle health management (IVHM) has primarily addressed hardware faults. All fielded software has residual errors, and the marginal costs to remove errors grow as the target residual error rate decreases. Our innovation is the development of tools, architectural concepts and software development methodologies to extend IVHM systems to detect, isolate and recover from software errors, as a cost effective way to increase the reliability and robustness of flight software. Software fault detection, isolation and recovery (SFDIR) fixes or contains the impact of faults and reduces the possibility of catastrophic loss.  Each phase ? detection, isolation, and recovery ? raises new research challenges. This work addresses automated diagnostics of mission-critical avionics and middleware or software toolkits to lower the cost of developing online health monitoring applications. Our technical objectives are to detect, by code instrumentation, when the software state violates explicated safety constraints; using model-based reasoning and program analysis techniques, to trace from symptom to error source; and to recover from errors in a safe way preserving or replacing as much functionality as possible, and in all cases "to do no harm". This technology may also be applied to monitor potential security threats.* [Global Gridded Geographically Based Economic Data (G-Econ), Version 4](https://data.nasa.gov/d/y7sx-uaxy) - The Global Gridded Geographically Based Economic Data (G-Econ), Version 4 contains derived one degree grid cells of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data in GRID and ASCII formats for both Market Exchange Rate (MER) and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) for the years 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. MER is the exchange rate between local and U.S. dollar currencies for a given time period established by the market. PPP is the exchange rate between a country's currency and U.S. dollars adjusted to reflect the actual cost in U.S. dollars of purchasing a standardized market basket of goods in that country using the country's currency. The original data from the G-Econ Project at Yale University is also available in tabular format and includes latitude and longitude geographic coordinates of the grid cells, area of grid cells, as well as country names, distance to coast, elevation, vegetation, population, precipitation and temperature.* [A Synthetic Biology Architecture to Detoxify and Enrich Mars Soil for Agriculture](https://data.nasa.gov/d/itf7-xpxy) - Although the theoretical case for space biological engineering is convincing, since recent studies on the use of biology in space showed substantial payload minimization over abiotic approaches even before any engineering, the functioning of these biological technologies has yet to be proven in a space-like environment. We will study such functioning for a synthetic biology architecture that can detoxify the perchlorate in Mars soil and also enrich it with ammonia. Our work will inform a prime deliverable of a comparative assessment with alternate chemical approaches postulated or scoped by NASA, and will clarify the feasibility of utilizing our proposed biotechnology to support manned Mars missions. The two system processes of perchlorate reduction and nitrogen fixation individually exist in biology and, when combined, will potentiate soil-based agriculture (by plants or microbes) on Mars. Our concept architecture is a single model organism that will eventually have both systems that are now separate in different strains of the same species. The advantages of our proposed architecture over current approaches, such as washing out perchlorate to cleanse soil or using hydroponics to grow plants, include a low initialization mass of microbial cells, on- demand cell growth with in situ resources, and the elimination of toxic wastewater. To accomplish our proposed concept architecture, we will investigate two strains of a diverse clade of organisms, Pseudomonas, which includes relevant extremophiles. Pseudomonas stutzeri PDA is a perchlorate reducer that we have previously studied using a method that examines the fitness profiles of organism mutants in several environment conditions to obtain genetic determinants of fitness. Pseudomonas stutzeri is also capable of nitrogen fixation (e.g. strain A1501). Pseudomonas has two advantages that make experiments with it more practical than with other space synthetic biology possibilities like photosynthetic, extremophile cyanobacteria: the use of the same host cloning vectors as the model laboratory organism Escherichia coli, and a doubling time of an hour, which is much faster than seven hours for a model non-extremophile cyanobacterium and four days for a model extremophile cyanobacterium. We will test an environmentally-relevant Pseudomonas host that, in follow-on work, we expect to refactor for efficient expression, operation, and interfacing to different hosts including Pseudomonad extremophiles, cyanobacteria, and other mission possibilities. Here, we will map perchlorate reduction and nitrogen fixation performance to host physiology and environment variables. Since we have already developed a microbial growth chamber that can apply environment parameters over Mars-relevant ranges, e.g., pressure from 10 kPa, temperature from -60 degrees C to 40 degrees C, light intensities up to 25 klx, UV radiation, and a 95%-3% carbon dioxide-nitrogen atmosphere, we will study how strains PDA and A1501 perform in increasingly Mars-like conditions, and what genetic mechanisms mediate survival, growth and activities in these conditions. By controllably exploring functionality, we will map the most extreme conditions in which our mesophile can survive, grow and perform. We will then identify limitations on these activities, and derive targets for future individual and joint optimization of system operation in parameter ranges that are more like Mars. Our work will enable a techno-economic analysis of performance versus output-generation time, input/nutrient mass needs, necessity of alternate chemical approaches, etc. Our concept will achieve the “promising potential” of biological technologies, identified in the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap TA 7 as “deserve[ing] sine attention.” Broader impacts include Earth-based bioremediation (e.g., land cleanup near oil wells and toxic spills) and non-arable land enrichment to improve food production to address famines, drought, larger populations, etc.* [ISLSCP II FASIR-adjusted NDVI, 1982-1998](https://data.nasa.gov/d/jc5t-749b) - The Fourier-Adjusted, Sensor and Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated, Reconstructed (FASIR) adjusted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 17-year, satellite record of monthly changes in the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation. FASIR-NDVI data are also used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface. There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection. The production of the FASIR NDVI data set and its associated biophysical parameters was funded by NASA's Land Surface Hydrology program and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) as a core component of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II Data Collection.* [Towards Efficient Viscous Modeling Based on Cartesian Methods for Automated Flow Simulation, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kjxx-ai8x) - The proposed work aims at developing techniques that will address the
current limitations of Cartesian-based Navier-Stokes CFD schemes by
exploring three promising methods of implementing improved wall boundary
conditions. The three methods are based on: (1) the diamond stencil
approach of Delanaye et al., (2) the extrapolation boundary condition
work by Marshall and Ruffin, and (3) the Material Point Method developed
by Advanced Dynamics. The knowledge gained from prototype
implementations of these schemes will lead to the development of an
efficient viscous modeling algorithm suitable to general Cartesian CFD
codes at the end of Phase I. Phase II will integrate this algorithm into
a large-scale Cartesian CFD code in consultation with NASA technical
representative. Phase III will commercialize the resulting techniques to
be developed in Phases I and II and demonstrate their applicability to a
wide range of problems.* [Standardized 'Pre-flight' Exercise Tests to Predict Performance during Extravehicular Activities in a Lunar Environment Project](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kvaq-63x8) - &lt;p&gt;Several manuscripts have been submitted or are in final preparation for submission from the Phase I data. Phase II has been completed, with a total of 12 subjects finishing the protocol. Each subject attempted to complete 9 laps of our obstacle course at two different paces; one representing the average pace of the Apollo astronauts during lunar EVAs (VO2 of ~20 ml/kg/min) and one at an estimated suited Martian cost of 30 ml/kg/min. All subjects were able to complete the course at the Lunar pace. However, at the Martian pace, 5 of the 12 subjects failed ~ lap 5. Subjects who completed the Martian pace had a VO2max on average of 44.3 &amp;plusmn; 5.0 ml/kg/min, while the 5 who failed (3 men, 2 women) had a VO2max of 36.8 &amp;plusmn; 2.9 ml/kg/min. Further, the Martian pace was likely at or above the critical speed of the subjects who failed. EMG and Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) signals differed by pace, but were not different between those who successfully completed both paces and those who failed at the Martian pace. Initial analysis of EMG and NIRS data failed to find any differences in the responses between those that failed and those that successfully completed the 9 laps. These results are being written up for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the hoist suspension system is operational to the point of being able to conduct pilot experiments. We have acquired preliminary VO2 responses during ambulation at 3 mph under 1-g, Martian (3/8-g), and Lunar (1/6-g) offloading. In addition, during the Lunar offloading, subjects naturally and unconsciously assumed an almost skipping stride pattern, very similar to that adopted by the Apollo astronauts during lunar EVAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;* [NONA Repair of Composite Structures, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/ib7j-quvs) - While much attention is necessarily focused on the evaluation and certification of the materials and processes involved in adhesive bonding, development is still needed in decreasing the cost, time, and complexity of the current repair concepts. A material and processing system is needed that allows the design, infusion, and cure of composite repairs without the current roadblocks imposed by ovens, autoclaves, and expensive tooling. VARTM processing of custom repairs allows freedom in design and minimizes the specialized tooling required for patches and straps that are prefabricated apart from the structures needing repair. CRG's no-oven, no-autoclave (NONA) composite processing technology enables the fabrication of high-performance composite parts without the limitations imposed by autoclaves and ovens. NASA originally funded CRG to develop the materials and processes for the manufacture of large, single-piece space launch structures. Building on that activity, CRG proposes NONA repair of composite structures. In this concept, NONA resin is introduced to a scarfed surface and dry fiber via VARTM processing and undergoes complete cure without additional heat input. NONA offers the opportunity to repair PMC structures on-site without the use of large capital equipment. The University of Dayton Research Institute will conduct the scarfing and evaluation of test materials. The resin consists of common aerospace epoxy components, but it is formulated to achieve complete cure in a matter of hours without additional heat input. The two-part epoxy system uses its own chemical energy to propel itself through a complete cure.  It provides good strength, chemical resistance, and thermal performance up to 350 deg. F. CRG envisions a mobile fleet of NONA composite technicians that can perform repair activities at manufacturing sites around the world, restoring functionality to damaged structures and tools, minimizing impact on plant operations and production.* [Global Annual Average PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/i7t3-dqnp) - Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data sets represent a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data. Together the grids provide a continuous surface of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. The satellite AOD retrievals were converted to ground-level concentrations based on a conversion factor developed by researchers at Dalhousie University that accounts for spatial and temporal variations in aerosol properties and vertical structure as derived from a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 30 arc-minutes (0.5 degree or approximately 50 sq. km at the equator) and cover the world from 70°N to 60°S latitude. The grids were produced by researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute in collaboration with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network/Columbia University under a NASA-ROSES project entitled "Using Satellite Data to Develop Environmental Indicators: An Application of NASA Data Products to Support High Level Decisions for National and International Environmental Protection". Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature death as well as increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease, especially in the elderly, young children, and those already suffering from these illnesses. The World Health Organization guideline for PM2.5 average annual exposure is less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms per cubic meter, whereas the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) primary standard is less than or equal to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA primary standards are designed to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.* [Physical Modeling for Anomaly Diagnostics and Prognostics, Phase II](https://data.nasa.gov/d/db8i-z2d6) - Ridgetop developed an innovative, model-driven anomaly diagnostic and fault characterization system for electromechanical actuator (EMA) systems to mitigate catastrophic failures. 
Ridgetop developed a MIL-STD-1553 bus monitor and a MIL-STD-1553 bus controller that simulates the aircraft data bus, reads the environmental (i.e., altitude) and operational (i.e., response of system) data of a system and determines if a fault is manifesting; and if true determines the root cause and symptoms of the fault. Once an anomaly is detected, the Model-based Avionic Prognostic Reasoner (MAPR) solves a user-outlined state-space model, symbolically, using a Gauss-Newton optimization method and the information from the MIL-STD-1553 bus. This algorithm outputs a list of best fitting parameters to match the command to the actual performance. Rules are programmed in, based on results from principal component analysis . The rules determine both fault mode and the severity of that fault. The rules can distinguish between two failure modes: Mechanical jam and MOSFET failure, and healthy.
The real-time processing will allow for critical evolutions in flight safety and provides a game-changing approach to condition-based maintenance. Once  deployed, flight safety can be improved by allowing the on-board flight computers to read from the MAPR and update their control envelope based on its evaluations, reducing damage propagation and increasing operational safety. 
In Phase 2, we will develop a functioning ground-based prototype of the technology to show the efficacy of the method. A ground-based version of the tool is the best candidate for development to ease adoption by testing in a low-risk environment; this tool will be demonstrated at the end of Phase 2. The MAPR concept is also applicable to any system with a state-space representation but at this point it has been developed with EMAs in mind. 
The MAPR prototype is at TRL 5 and will reach a TRL 7 by the end of Phase 2.* [Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Biodiversity](https://data.nasa.gov/d/9mfy-wzq5) - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: MA Biodiversity provides data and information on amphibians, disease agents (extent and distribution of infectious and parasitic diseases), drylands (cattle, sheep and goats, and pasture), islands (fishing pressure, sewage pollution index and tourism), loss of natural land cover (biomes and realms), polar population, species distribution models, and terrestrial ecoregions and realms. Biodiversity is defined as the variability among living organisms from all sources, including terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are a part. The original information was received from multiple sources that include the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, formerly the World Conservation Union), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) of Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on-board NASA satellites Terra and Aqua. Through the Convention on Biological Diversity, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, and the Convention on Migratory Species, the data were also designed to meet the needs of stakeholders in the business, civil and native communities.* [Decadal Variations in NDVI and Food Production in India](https://data.nasa.gov/d/hbap-xs3e) - In this study we use long-term satellite, climate, and crop observations to document the spatial distribution of the recent stagnation in food grain production affecting the water-limited tropics (WLT), a region where 1.5 billion people live and depend on local agriculture that is constrained by chronic water shortages. Overall, our analysis shows that the recent stagnation in food production is corroborated by satellite data. The growth rate in annually integrated vegetation greenness, a measure of crop growth, has declined significantly (p < 0.10) in 23% of the WLT cropland area during the last decade, while statistically significant increases in the growth rates account for less than 2%. In most countries, the decade-long declines appear to be primarily due to unsustainable crop management practices rather than climate alone. One quarter of the statistically significant declines are observed in India, which with the world’s largest population of food-insecure people and largest WLT croplands, is a leading example of the observed declines. Here we show geographically matching patterns of enhanced crop production and irrigation expansion with groundwater that have leveled off in the past decade. We estimate that, in the absence of irrigation, the enhancement in dry-season food grain production in India, during 1982–2002, would have required an increase in annual rainfall of at least 30% over almost half of the cropland area. This suggests that the past expansion of use of irrigation has not been sustainable. We expect that improved surface and groundwater management practices will be required to reverse the recent food grain production declines.

The grids have a resolution of 30 arc-seconds (0.0083 decimal degrees), or approximately 1 square km. The gridded variables are based on census block   geography from Census 2000 TIGER/Line Files and census variables (income, poverty, education, housing age). This dataset is produced by the Columbia University Center for International   Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).* [Predictive Condition-Based Maintenance for Vertical Lift Vehicles, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/bw7t-fjgd) - NASA has invested significant effort in the past decade in developing and maturing technologies that enable efficient and effective use of Next-generation (NextGen) Vertical Lift (VL) systems for a broad class of missions and operations. One of the key barriers it faces to the widespread use of VL vehicles within the National Airspace is the cost of maintenance on the vehicles to keep them safe and reliable. Qualtech Systems, Inc (QSI) in collaboration with Lockheed Martin - Mission Systems and Training (LM-MST) seeks to address these maintenance challenges by fielding a predictive Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) solution leveraging a diagnostic reasoner TEAMS-RDS (Testability Engineering And Maintenance System Remote Diagnosis Server) and prognostic algorithms. CBM+ involves inferring, tracking and forecasting of system degradation based on state awareness acquired from monitored data through fault detection, isolation, identification, diagnosis and prognosis techniques and to proactively plan maintenance actions to improve system availability and safety. QSI-LM's CBM+ solution will furnish the ability to keep the vehicle health status continually ahead of an advancing failure accumulation through a predictive maintenance strategy geared towards replacement-while-in-operation before the ensuing failures render the VL vehicle inoperable. Diagnosis will focus on current health state identification through detection, isolation, root cause analysis and identification of faults that have already occurred, while prognosis will leverage the current health state identification and forecast performance degradation, incipient component failures and probability density (or moments) of remaining useful life (RUL) or Time to Maintenance (TTM) or Time to Failure (TTF). It is anticipated that the CBM+ solution will leverage the currently existing communication capabilities between the aircraft, the pilot and ground-support personnel in a seamless and automated manner.* [Data Reduction Techniques for Real-time Fault Detection and Diagnosis, and Multiple Fault Inference with Imperfect Tests, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/4dv5-yaky) - The recent advances in data collection and storage capabilities have led to information overload in many applications, including on-line monitoring of spacecraft operations with time series data. Such datasets present new challenges in data analysis, especially for implementation in memory-constrained DECUs.  Also, the traditional statistical methods break down partly because of the increase in the number of observations (measurements), but mostly due to an increase in the number of variables associated with each observation ("dimension of the data"). One of the problems with high-dimensional datasets is that not all the measured variables are "important" for understanding the underlying phenomena of interest. In addition to the computational cost, irrelevant features may also cause a reduction in the accuracy of some algorithms.  The first key issue we propose to address is that of data reduction techniques for onboard implementation of data-driven classification techniques in memory-constrained onboard processing units. Some of the classification techniques we intend to use with the above data-reduction techniques include, support vector machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), principal component Bayesian analysis (PCA). To improve the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of the above classifiers, we will apply classifier fusion techniques such as AdaBoost, Error correcting output codes, Voting to find which architecture will enhance the accuracy and under what conditions. Finally we will investigate Dynamic Multiple Fault Diagnosis that can work with imperfect fault/anomaly detection tests. As part of this task, we will develop novel factorial hidden Markov model-based inferencing techniques such as Lagrangian relaxation and Viterbi decoding algorithms to solve this difficult combinatorial optimization problem, for on-board vehicle health monitoring and fault diagnosis.* [Laser transmitter for space-based water vapor lidar](https://data.nasa.gov/d/kdvm-vmpf) - Water vapor (WV) lies at the heart of most key atmospheric processes. Humidity is essential for the development of severe weather, it influences, directly and indirectly through cloud formation, the planetary radiative balance, and it influences atmospheric dynamics, surface fluxes and soil moisture. Despite its central importance, research to date has not led to a universally accepted picture of the factors controlling WV amount, a solid understanding of the mechanisms by which it influences atmospheric processes, or even precise knowledge of its concentrations in many parts of the atmosphere.
 
A future satellite-based WV Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) would revolutionize weather and climate research by providing high-resolution and accurate WV profiles with global coverage. Passive microwave and IR measurements are the backbone of weather and climate research but have significant limitations. Passive measurements are weighted toward the upper troposphere and hence have very little sensitivity near the surface where the majority of WV and its largest spatial and temporal gradients reside. Passive sounders also suffer from coarse vertical resolution and unknown biases resulting from aerosol and cloud contamination. The DIAL approach is self-calibrating, and its measurement uncertainties can be precisely quantified and traded by adapting the spatial resolution to the defined scientific objective. Furthermore, the DIAL approach can overcome one of the largest shortcomings of current passive measurements by adjusting the measurement sensitivity to near-surface atmosphere to capture the moisture variability above and through the boundary layer, in the presence of intervening cloud and aerosol layers in order to improve our understanding of fundamental mechanisms driving convection and cloud microphysics.

Conventional WV DIAL lasers are inadequate for space-based operation as they are inefficient, complex, and have low average power, which limits precision and spatial resolution. We propose to build a WV DIAL laser transmitter to enable WV DIAL measurements throughout the troposphere from a space-based platform. The transmitter will probe an atmospheric WV absorption line near 816 nm, allowing for profile measurements of WV number density using the DIAL technique, and aerosol and cloud profiles using the backscatter lidar approach.  As part of this effort, we will advance the TRL of the laser transmitter to lower the development time, risk, and cost of a future WV DIAL satellite instrument.
The proposed laser will utilize thulium-based solid-state laser crystals, which offer the prospect of greatly improved efficiency, simplicity, and average-power scalability compared to conventional methods. Recent proof-of-principle demonstrations of Tm:LiYF4 (YLF) lasers highlight the promise of the proposed approach, provide laser physics understanding, and set a clear development path. The objective of this proposal is to develop Tm:YLF lasers with the energy per pulse (≥100 mJ), average power (≥10 W, 50 Hz double pulsed), efficiency (≥5%), and spectral control (≥ 99.9% spectral purity) needed for a space-based WV DIAL. The period of performance for the proposed effort is 3 years. Years 1 and 2 will focus on risk reduction where critical performance metrics will be demonstrated on a bench top breadboard. In year 3 we will design and build a brassboard laser compatible with the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) WV DIAL, High Altitude Lidar Observatory (HALO). We exit the program with a brassboard laser that has the performance of a space-based WV DIAL system and will be validated using HALO in a follow-on effort from high-altitude aircraft as a stepping stone to space. This technology has entry TRL-2 and a planned TRL-4 exit with a clear path to TRL-5 in a follow-on program by incorporation of the brassboard laser into HALO.* [Global Landslide Catalog Export](https://data.nasa.gov/d/rthp-tcrg) - The Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was developed with the goal of identifying rainfall-triggered landslide events around the world, regardless of size, impacts or location. The GLC considers all types of mass movements triggered by rainfall, which have been reported in the media, disaster databases, scientific reports, or other sources. The GLC has been compiled since 2007 at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This is a unique data set with the ID tag “GLC” in the landslide editor. This dataset on data.nasa.gov was a one-time export from the Global Landslide Catalog maintained separately. It is current as of March 7, 2016.

[2]* [Ground-Based Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Weekly Station Position Product from NASA CDDIS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/5mec-2bdz) - Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Data (multi-day files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis to compute weekly station position solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. The IDS Analysis Center Coordinator combines these individual AC solutions in a standard least-squares adjustment to generate the official IDS weekly combined station position solution. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/DORIS/DORIS_product_holdings.html.* [JAWS: Justified AWS-like data through workflow enhancements that ease access and add scientific value](https://data.nasa.gov/d/qckz-tpbc) - Automated Weather Station and AWS-like networks are the primary source of surface-level meteorological data in remote polar regions. These networks have developed organically and independently, and deliver data to researchers in idiosyncratic ASCII formats that hinder automated processing and intercomparison among networks. Moreover, station tilt causes significant biases in polar AWS measurements of radiation and wind direction. Researchers, network operators, and data centers would benefit from AWS-like data in a common format, amenable to automated analysis, and adjusted for known biases. This project addresses these needs by developing a scientific software workflow called "Justified AWS" (JAWS) to ingest Level 2 (L2) data in the multiple formats now distributed, harmonize it into a common format, and deliver value-added Level 3 (L3) output suitable for distribution by the network operator, analysis by the researcher, and curation by the data center. 
Polar climate researchers currently face daunting problems including how to easily: 1. Automate analysis  (subsetting, statistics, unit conversion) of AWS-like L2 ASCII data. 2. Combine or intercompare data and data quality from among unharmonized L2 datasets. 3. Adjust L2 data for biases such as AWS tilt angle and direction. JAWS addresses these common issues by harmonizing AWS L2 data into a common format, and applying accepted methods to quantify quality and estimate biases. Specifically, JAWS enables users and network operators to 1. Convert L2 data (usually ASCII tables) into a netCDF-based L3 format compliant with metadata conventions (Climate-Forecast and ACDD) that promote automated discovery and analysis. 2. Include value-added L3 features like the Retrospective, Iterative, Geometry-Based (RIGB) tilt angle and direction corrections, solar angles, and standardized quality flags. 3. Provide a scriptable API to extend the initial L2-to-L3 conversion to newer AWS-like networks and instruments. Polar AWS network experts and NSIDC DAAC personnel, each with decades of experience, will help guide and deliberate the L3 conventions implemented in Stages 2-3.
The project will start on July 1, 2017 at entry Technology Readiness Level 3 and will exit on June 30, 2019 at TRL 6. JAWS is now a heterogeneous collection of scripts and methods developed and validated at UCI over the past 15 years. At exit, JAWS will comprise three modular stages written in or wrapped by Python, installable by Conda: Stage 1 ingests and translates L2 data into netCDF. Stage 2 annotates the netCDF with CF and ACDD metadata. Stage 3 derives value-added scientific and quality information. The labor-intensive tasks include turning our heterogeneous workflow into a robust, standards-compliant, extensible workflow with an API based on best practices of modern scientific information systems and services. Implementation of Stages 1-2 may be straightforward though tedious due to the menagerie of L2 formats, instruments, and assumptions. The RIGB component of Stage 3 requires ongoing assimilation of ancillary NASA data (CERES, AIRS) and use of automated data transfer protocols (DAP, THREDDS).
The immediate target recipient elements are polar AWS network managers, users, and data distributors. L2 borehole data suffers from similar interoperability issues, as does non-polar AWS data. Hence our L3 format will be extensible to global AWS and permafrost networks. JAWS will increase in situ data accessibility and utility, and enable new derived products (both are AIST goals). The PI is a long-standing researcher, open source software developer, and educator who understands obstacles to harmonizing disparate datasets with NASA interoperability recommendations. Our team participates in relevant geoscience communities, including ESDS working groups, ESIP, AGU, and EarthCube.* [Microbiological Quality and Food Safety of Plants Grown on ISS](https://data.nasa.gov/d/r8xg-fbm2) - <p>A challenge for growing fresh foods (vegetables) in space is demonstrating that they are safe for consumption according to NASA microbiological standards set for food. The goal of this project is to select and advance methods to enable real-time sampling, microbiological analysis, and sanitation of crops grown on the &nbsp;International Space Station (ISS). These methods would validate the microbiological quality of crops grown for consumption to ensure safe and palatable fresh foods. This will be achieved through the development / advancement of microbiological sample collection, rapid pathogen detection, and effective sanitation methods that are compatible with a microgravity environment.</p> <p>This project aligns with current plans for deployment of a vegetable production unit on the International Space Station (Veggie) and the procurement and evaluation of platforms (RAZOR) at Kennedy Space Center for rapid microbial monitoring on ISS.</p><p>A 3-step approach is being used to evaluate and modify methods for analyzing fresh produce (fresh vegetables / fruits) that would be compatible with a microgravity environment. Candidate food crops are being grown in a controlled environment chamber for the following tests:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Assessment of sampling procedures for surfaces of edible plant material to gather meaningful microbiological data. The three sample methods are surface swabbing, the use of adhesive tape to collect surface microbes and a blender method to remove microbes from plant tissue. The blender method is the conventional method for food sample processing. The other two methods have been tested as portable real-time methods to collect samples from the surfaces of meat as well as produce including tomato fruit and leafy greens</li><li>Analysis of samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), arabidopsis thaliana peroxidases (ATP) analysis, and culture based methods for enumeration as well as identification of target organisms with an emphasis on approaches that yield rapid results. The methods employed are all commercially available technologies. Our goal is to reduce detection time with the constraints of methodology that could practically be used on the ISS for sample analysis.</li><li>Comparison of sanitizing and disinfection procedures for the vegetables and plant growth unit surfaces, including methods developed and tested in the AES Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU). The focus is on the development of a sanitizing wipe that can be used on plant growth systems such as Veggie as well as edible plant surfaces to reduce the microbial load. The sanitizer being used is a citric acid based food grade sanitizer (Pro-San<sup>&reg;</sup>). This sanitizer has been tested previously and has been shown to be effective in the sanitization of edible vegetables.</li></ol><p><strong>Progress</strong></p><p>A series of experiments has been completed using three different sampling procedures, swabbing, adhesive tape collection and sample blending for the recovery of bacteria from the surface of radish, tomato and lettuce. Data collected and analyzed to date show no significant difference using culture based detection methods between the adhesive tape and bag blender sample methods in the recovery of <em>Salmonella enterica</em> Typhimurium, a human associated food borne pathogen inoculated onto the surface of lettuce, tomato, and radish. The swab method recovery was significantly lower then the other two methods in the case of lettuce and radish. With the samples collected by these different sampling procedures we are comparing detection and quantification methods, specifically real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) using two platforms, the LightCycler&reg; (Roche Diagnostics) and a rapid portable system, the RAZOR (Biofire, Salt Lake City, UT) with conventional culture based methods. For these tests we used <em>S. enterica </em>Typhimurium and <em>Eshcerichia coli</em> K12 inoculated onto the surface* [The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Genomes (SETG)](https://data.nasa.gov/d/tngt-vgkw) - <p>Background: Widespread synthesis of complex organics, including nucleobases and ribose precursors, occurred early in the history of the solar system in the solar nebula. These organics, delivered by comets and meteorites to multiple potentially habitable zones (Earth, Mars, Enceladus, Europa, Titan) may have biased the evolution of life towards utilization of similar informational polymers. Meteoritic exchange might also have produced shared ancestry, most plausible for Earth and Mars. We propose to continue development of the ASTID-funded Search for Extra-Terrestrial Genomes (SETG), a life detection instrument for in-situ sequencing of nucleic acids. Science Goals: Our mission focus area is astrobiology and the search for life beyond Earth. Our science goal for Mars is to search for related or unrelated nucleic acid-based life, particularly life that has the potential to interact with life on Earth; this may also inform sample selection for Mars Sample Return (MSR) and reduce the risks of false positives through the first in-situ measurement of forward contamination. Our science goal for Enceladus is to search for a second genesis based on nucleic acids in the plumes emanating from the South Polar Region. Life detection may also be possible in Europa orbit but the availability of a suitable plume is tenuous and it is a challenge for biological reagents to survive intense radiation there. Objectives: The objectives of this proposal are to 1) advance SETG component/subsystem development through validation in lab and relevant environments, 2) integrate instrument components into a single automated end-to-end system, and 3) assess and validate instrument performance and limits of detection (expected to be ppb or better) using synthetic and environmental samples, including operation under Mars temperature and pressure. Methodology: We will apply advances in nucleic acid extraction and concentration to enable high-yield isolation of high-purity nucleic acids, followed by nanopore-based detection and single-molecule sequencing-by-synthesis. This effort will include stabilization of all reagents. B. subtilis spores will be used to validate detection limits down to 50 spores, with testing to 10 spores. To further assess system performance, we will use other synthetic and environmental samples, carry out bench top and field validation, and operation under Mars-like temperature and pressure conditions; this will advance SETG from TRL 3 to TRL 6 in preparation for future flight definition. Relevance: SETG addresses the NASA Science Plan question &#39;How did life begin and evolve on Earth and has it evolved elsewhere in the solar system?&#39; and the corresponding objective to &#39;Identify and investigate past or present habitable environments on Mars and other worlds, and determine if there is or has ever been life elsewhere in the solar system.&#39; Our effort is responsive to Decadal Survey priorities, including Mars Sample Return, Europa Orbiter, and the moderate-priority Enceladus orbiter. Why MATISSE? First, SETG requires substantial additional development and validation before flight definition, and addresses the specified TRL range. Second, our effort will help to provide heritage for a new class of instruments that utilize biological components to enable a range of new capabilities at extremely low power, mass, and volume. Third, we cannot envision a discovery that would be higher payoff than the indisputable identification of life beyond Earth, which SETG is uniquely positioned to do. Finally, SETG also has significant Earth applications ranging from environmental monitoring to clinical diagnosis.</p>* [Cloud-Based Social Media Visual Analytics Disaster Response System, Phase I](https://data.nasa.gov/d/pnda-zj57) - We propose a next-generation cloud-based social media visual analytics disaster response system that will enable decision-makers and first-responders to obtain real-time analytics (both descriptive and predictive) for situational awareness and early-warning. Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook provide rapid "sensory" feedback from "human sensors" &#150; the millions of people on the ground including those affected by the disaster as well as hundreds of first-responders and relief organizations. The problem is that this social media data can be overwhelming and noisy (lots of irrelevant stuff). Our proposed innovation is to combine and analyze this social media unstructured "big-data", together with other structured data from a variety of sources including NASA. The emphasis is on visual analytics which will allow all these diverse geospatial data to be integrated and analyzed on a real-time basis in an intuitive manner. We utilize geobrowsers such as COAST, Google Earth, and OpenStreetMap for display of the output of the visual analytics prediction system. This is an interactive system which enables the relevant users and decision-makers to provide input to the analytics process as the solution evolves.* [Global Landslide Data - Export - Visual Explorer](https://data.nasa.gov/view/angv-aquq) - <div>The Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was developed with the goal of identifying rainfall-triggered landslide events around the world, regardless of size, impacts or location.

The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an integrated system that will track physiological signals (heart rate and heart rate variability) and behavioral signals (sleep wake patterns) to detect chronic stress, hyperarousal, and insomnia during space missions. This project will deliver both the sensor hardware and signal processing software needed for the real-time data collection and integration with other behavioral health monitoring systems (e.g., Individualized Fatigue Meter and Individualized Behavioral Health Meter). The result of Phase II will be a system that can be deployed in space analog environments for validation testing and ultimately deployed on ISS to assist astronauts and mission support personnel in the detection of astronaut chronic stress, hyperarousal, and insomnia. The critical need for an Individualized Stress Detection System has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP IRP Gap BMED2. The Technology Readiness Level at the end of Phase II will be TRL 5.
