* [Reading Proficiency by School District](https://performance.smcgov.org/d/gh6e-jukt) - The map above shows the percent of third grade students scoring proficient or higher on the English Language Arts California Standards Test by school district. The size and color of the plot point is determined by the percent of students scoring proficient or higher in that school district. The blue plot point represents students scoring 80%; the green plot point represents students scoring between 61% and 79%; and the red plot point represents students scoring less than 60%. Click on a plot point to see the specific details of each district. The year presented is the final year of a school year. For example, 2010-2011 is represented as 2011. Data that has been suppressed because there were fewer than 20 estimated students with proficient or advanced scores is represented as LNE (Low Number Event). No data available is represented as N/A. Data Source: California Department of Education, Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) Results, http://star.cde.ca.gov/ (July 2012).

* [Poverty- percent below poverty over time ACS](https://performance.smcgov.org/d/wb63-niir) - Poverty threshold available at https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/threshld/index.html Additional information about how the Census Bureau measures poverty is available at https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measure.html --------------------------------- How Poverty is Calculated in the ACS Poverty statistics presented in ACS reports and tables adhere to the standards specified by
the Office of Management and Budget in Statistical Policy Directive 14. The Census
Bureau uses a set of dollar value thresholds that vary by family size and composition to
determine who is in poverty. Further, poverty thresholds for people living alone or with
nonrelatives (unrelated individuals) and two-person families vary by age (under 65 years
or 65 years and older). If a family’s total income is less than the dollar value of the appropriate threshold, then
that family and every individual in it are considered to be in poverty. Similarly, if an
unrelated individual’s total income is less than the appropriate threshold, then that
individual is considered to be in poverty. The poverty thresholds do not vary
geographically. They are updated annually to allow for changes in the cost of living
(inflation factor) using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Poverty status was determined for all people except institutionalized people, people in
military group quarters, people in college dormitories, and unrelated individuals under 15
years old. These groups were excluded from the numerator and denominator when
calculating poverty rates. Since the ACS is a continuous survey, people respond throughout the year. Because the
income items specify a period covering the last 12 months, the appropriate poverty
thresholds are determined by multiplying the base-year poverty thresholds (1982) by the
monthly inflation factor based on the 12 monthly CPIs and the base-year CPI.
