* [Fire Incident by dispatch](https://opendata.howardcountymd.gov/d/23bu-u4zr) - Emergency incidents created by HCPD's 911 Dispatch Center and classified as Fire, Rescue or Emergency Medical Service (EMS) calls. Not all of these incidents are created as cases, and thus not all of these incidents have a matching record in the Howard County Fire & Rescue Incidents table.
