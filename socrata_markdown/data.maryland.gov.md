* [MD iMAP: Maryland Archived ACS ZIP Code](https://data.maryland.gov/d/ekbh-bmuc) - This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov. The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide -  continuous survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely demographic -  housing -  social and economic data. The ACS replaces the decennial census long form in 2010 and every year thereafter. The annual ACS sample is smaller than that of previous long form surveys resulting in a larger sampling error. Coefficients of Variation (CVs) -  which are statistical measures that show the relative amount of sampling error associated with an estimate -  are presented here as a measure of reliability and usability of the data. The unit of geography used for the 2009 - 2013 data is the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA). ZCTAs are statistical geographic areas produced by the Census Bureau by aggregating census blocks to create generalized areas closely resembling the U.S. Postal Service's postal ZIP codes.

The Directory lists certified firms in alphabetical order and also contains information on the specific products and/or services the firm is certified to provide. The MDOT makes no claims, promises, or guarantees regarding a certified firm’s competence or capability to perform or enter into a contract. It is the responsibility of the user of the information provided in the Directory to make his/her own determination regarding the capability, competence, and/or limitations of a certified firm, as well as the firm’s ability to do business in the State.

Inspections are conducted every year on all MDTA facilities. Defects identified in yearly inspections are assigned a defect rating based on severity by the inspector.  As a measure of quality assurance and control, the rating is reviewed and confirmed by in-house inspection staff during review of the inspection reports. The defects are prioritized based on the confirmed rating and major rehabilitation, total replacement or proactive system preservation projects are developed based on the priorities and overall condition assessment.   

Bridges are considered structurally deficient if significant load carrying elements are found to be in a poor (or worse) condition due to deterioration and/or damage, or have a low weight restriction.  The fact that a bridge is structurally deficient does not imply that it is unsafe.  MDTA reported 5 structurally deficient bridges from the 2011 inspection cycle and four of these bridges are already in construction with the fifth in design for full replacement in 2014.  The number of structurally deficient bridges is not anticipated to increase significantly over the next several years as MDTA continues to address needs using a bridge management system to identify and address those bridges that are nearing the end of their useful life.* [Line Graph - Drug and Alcohol-related Deaths](https://data.maryland.gov/d/jfnt-78hu) - Data sources: heroin overdose deaths/infant mortality-Vital Statistics Administration; lead-Medicaid; HIV diagnoses-Prevention and Health Promotion Administration; and immunizations-National Immunization Survey.* [GOPI Resource: School Facilities - Annual school maintenance inspection ratings](https://data.maryland.gov/d/tgeh-qdu3) - An aggregated, multi-agency data set with information on college degrees, statewide degree attainment, average school facility age, school facility maintenance evaluation, and Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) and Small-Business Reserve (SBR) program participation.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats -  because of their depth -  go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy -  the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats -  because of their depth -  go undetected by aerial imagery.

PQI measures are used to monitor performance over time or across regions and populations using patient data found in a typical hospital discharge abstract. PQI measures can be used to summarize quality across multiple indicators, improve ability to detect differences, identify important domains and drivers of quality, prioritize action for quality improvement, make current decisions about future and unknown health care needs. 
Overall Composite (PQI #90) is comprised of: all PQI measures within the Chronic and Acute Composites.

Chronic Composite (PQI #92) is comprised of: PQI #01 Diabetes Short-Term Complications Admission Rate, PQI #03 Diabetes Long-Term Complications Admission Rate, PQI #05 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or Asthma in Older Adults Admission Rate, PQI #07 Hypertension Admission Rate, PQI #08 Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Admission Rate, PQI #13 Angina without Procedure Admission Rate, PQI #14 Uncontrolled Diabetes Admission Rate, PQI #15 Asthma in Younger Adults Admission Rate, PQI #16 Rate of Lower-Extremity Amputation Among Patients With Diabetes, 

Acute Composite (PQI #91) is comprised of: PQI #10 Dehydration Admission Rate, PQI #11 Bacterial Pneumonia Admission Rate, and PQI #12 Urinary Tract Infection Admission Rate.

One out of 1,276 cases had grade information missed, 564 were in Kindergarten and 711 in 3rd grade.  Prevalence is defined as occurrence of any caries among all selected population.  Mean is the average number of teeth with caries among students with caries in the selected population.  Region Identifiers and Constituent Counties:
