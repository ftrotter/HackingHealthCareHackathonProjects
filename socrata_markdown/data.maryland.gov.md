* [MD iMAP: Maryland Archived ACS ZIP Code](https://data.maryland.gov/d/ekbh-bmuc) - This is a MD iMAP hosted service. Find more information on http://imap.maryland.gov. The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide - continuous survey designed to provide communities with reliable and timely demographic - housing - social and economic data. The ACS replaces the decennial census long form in 2010 and every year thereafter. The annual ACS sample is smaller than that of previous long form surveys resulting in a larger sampling error. Coefficients of Variation (CVs) - which are statistical measures that show the relative amount of sampling error associated with an estimate - are presented here as a measure of reliability and usability of the data. The unit of geography used for the 2009 - 2013 data is the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA). ZCTAs are statistical geographic areas produced by the Census Bureau by aggregating census blocks to create generalized areas closely resembling the U.S. Postal Service's postal ZIP codes.

* [MD iMAP: Maryland US National Grid Zone 18S - US National Grid Zone 18S (1000m)](https://data.maryland.gov/d/jreu-dgkv) - This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. This layer is the MGRS 1000m grid that covers Zone 18S which covers part of Maryland.The U.S. National Grid provides a standardized grid reference system that is seamless across jurisdictional boundaries and allows for pinpointing exact locations. Since USNG is standardized - it can be understood and used as a common geographic framework for response. Zone 18S covers part of Maryland. The vertical UTM boundaries are horizontal latitude band boundaries form (generally) 6 X 8 Grid Zones. Hence - the first three letters of the MGRS value - e.g. '18S' - are referred to as the Grid Zone Designator (GZD). The fourth and fifth characters are a pair of letters identifying one of the 100000-meter grid squares within the grid zone (or UPS area). The "S" in this instance is not to be confused with UTM Zone 18S for UTM in the Southern Hemisphere. There are no classification restrictions on this information.

* [MD iMAP: Maryland Federal Lands - Federal Lands](https://data.maryland.gov/d/c3g8-ixa9) - This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer. Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov. The federal Lands data consists of land areas that are run and maintained by United States Governmental authorities. These files were created for planning purposes and should not be used as a definitive source of mapped data for any of the associated types of land ownership. There have been intentional omissions due to sensitive data types and in some cases - the source documents cannot be considered complete.
