The mark is normally coordinated either horizontally and/or vertically using a recognised coordinate system. The mark can be used to coordinate surveys in the surrounding area. Survey Control Marks are displayed in ACTmapi by Mark type.
Trig Stations (MC)

Identifier: district names, old surveyors' names, for example, Tennent, Goodwin.
Today's trig stations consist of a ground mark with a white quadripod supporting a black disc above the ground mark. Most of these Trig Stations are part of the ACT Precision Zone, a national geodetic survey and adjustment carried out in the early 1970s. The ACT Precision Zone and its associated marks have been the primary control for all new development in the ACT since the early 1970s. The accuracy of ACT Precision Zone marks is 1 in 250,000.
Sectional Control Marks (SC)
Identifier: two alpha plus 1, 2 or 3 numerals, for example, TG116
These marks are fixed directly from the ACT Precision Zone at about one kilometre intervals. They usually consist of a deep driven rod protected by yellow concrete posts. Some Sectional Control marks are beaconed (for example, YA90, TG84). The accuracy of Sectional Control marks is 1 in 100,000.
Subdivision or Neighbourhood Control Marks or "RMs" (SRM)
Identifier: three numerals, for example, 363
These marks are fixed from the Sectional Control at intervals of between 200 and 400 metres. They usually consist (on placement only) of a galvanised pipe set in concrete protected by two steel droppers painted red and white. There may be an aluminium tag with the mark's identifier either set in the concrete of the mark or wired to one of the steel droppers. The accuracy of Subdivision Control is 1 in 30,000.
The subdivisions in Woden Valley (early 1960s) were the first to have Subdivision Control. In suburbs constructed before Gungahlin (pre-1990), Subdivision Control marks were 50 to 100 metres apart. Some of these marks survived development and can be found in open spaces in the suburbs. Only those SRMs in Gungahlin have been entered in the Survey Control Mark Detail Database Control Base. Information on others is contained on plans.
Coordinated Reference Marks or CRMs (CRM)
Identifier: CRM plus numerals - starting at 1 eg. CRM7381
In today's subdivisions numbered CRM plaques are placed in the kerb and coordinated by survey traverses that start and finish on Sectional or Subdivisional Control marks or other previously coordinated CRMs.
These marks are about 50 to 150 metres apart. Only subdivisions constructed after 1980 contain CRMs that appear on Deposited Plans. Most do not have a height attributed to them.
Many CRMs have been placed in the older suburbs of Canberra in recent years. These CRMs were coordinated using GPS and are on the AGC system, which is not the system of the surrounding subdivision. Since 16 April 1998 a new style of CRM is used that has a raised nipple for accurate levelling. These are numbered from 10,001 and up.
SR (Steel rod) Marks (SR)
Identifier: SR plus numerals - starting at 1 eg. SR1003
The ACT Government Survey Office places SR marks in new subdivisions - one for every 100 blocks. The mark consists of a deep driven steel rod contained within a small manhole marked "Survey mark". These SRs are included in the CRM traverses and are precise levelled. Many other SR marks have been placed throughout Canberra. Most are coordinated on the AGC system which may not be the coordinate system of the surrounding subdivision. Not all SR marks are levelled. Conversely, some SRs have been levelled, but are yet to be surveyed for co-ordinates.
Kerb Bench Mark (KBM)
Identifier: KBM plus numerals - starting at 1, for example, KBM5203
Kerb Bench Marks are placed in the kerbs throughout urban Canberra. They consist of a rectangular brass casting with a nipple and number. Distance between KBMs in new suburbs is 100 to 200 metres and levelling is to 3rd order accuracy. (Many kerbs have* [ACT Deaths - Influenza and Pneumonia (J09-J18)](https://www.data.act.gov.au/d/mbu8-464r) - The data contained in this dataset is based on the Cause Of Death Unit Record File (CODURF) provided by the Australian Coordinating Registry (ACR), the data has been aggregated based on either a single or grouped ICD-10* classification.

The Territory Plan guides the planning and development of the ACT. It is changed from time to time due to social, economic and environmental reasons. The Territory Plan is used to manage development, in particular the way in which land is used and what can be built. It is used in the process of assessing development applications and to guide the development of new estate areas (future urban land). Land in the ACT is divided into sections and blocks. The blocks are zoned and the zoning determines the form of development on a block. There are 23 different zones. The Territory Plan map shows all these zones as different colours.
The purpose of the Territory Plan map is to show the zones and overlays that apply to land in the ACT, in accordance with requirements under the Planning and Development Act 2007.

The requirement is consistent with Open Government and applies to all Territory entities.  The Notifiable Invoices Register, in conjunction with the ACT Government Contracts Register provides transparency about Government purchasing to the community. 

Notifiable Invoices are invoices with a value of $25,000 or more for goods, services or works received by the Territory or a Territory entity.  The Territory publishes details of notifiable invoices within 21 days after the end of the month in which the invoice was paid.			
			
For reporting from July 1 2017, the Territory will be including date invoice received in the notifiable invoices register.  A number of points should be taken into account when using this information:			
 - For the June 2017 reporting period, this field is the date that a valid invoice was received by the responsible Territory entity, however in small number of cases, it relates to the date the invoices was initially entered into the financial processing system of the Territory entity where known.			
 - A small proportion of notifiable invoices do not have date received information recorded.  This is due to a variety of reasons including some cases of scheduled payments under agreements or contracts not having an explicit invoice received date, and several reporting entities not yet being able to transmit to the Territory central finance system the date invoice received.
