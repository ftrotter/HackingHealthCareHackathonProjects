* [Graph of Recommended Per-Capita Funding Levels for State Programs (CDC Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs 2014)](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/d/ptqh-8pwj) - 2014. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs. Funding. CDC's Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs is an evidence-based guide to help states plan and establish effective tobacco control programs to prevent and reduce tobacco use. These data update Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs—2007. Data are reported at total and per capita funding levels. Data include recommended and minimum total funding levels for state programs, in addition to funding breakdowns by intervention areas such as: State and Community Interventions, Mass-Reach Health Communication Interventions, Cessation Interventions, Surveillance and Evaluation, and Infrastructure, Administration, and Management.
* [States with a Dental Director](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/d/qek2-iyap) - 2018. The ASTDD Synopses of State Oral Health Programs contain information useful in tracking states’ efforts to improve oral health and contributions to progress toward the national targets for Healthy People objectives for oral health. A subset of the information collected from the most recent five years is provided on the Oral Health Data website. For more information, see http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealthdata/overview/synopses/index.html
* [HRQOL: JB Chart of Mean Physically or Mentally unhealthy Days](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/d/76jj-qcyi) - 1993 - 2010. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Data are from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). All respondents to the BRFSS are non-institutionalized adults, 18 years old or older. HRQOL surveillance is used to identify unmet population health needs including recognizing trends, disparities, and determinants of health in the population. HRQOL surveillance data can be used to inform decision making, and program and policy development. To assure that the population is benefiting from public health programs, HRQOL surveillance data can be used for program evaluation. A compact set of HRQOL measures including a summary measure of unhealthy days have been developed and validated for population health surveillance and have been widely used since 1993.
* [U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators: Disability](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/d/72v6-pkw3) - CDC's Division of Population Health provides cross-cutting set of 124 indicators that were developed by consensus and that allows states and territories and large metropolitan areas to uniformly define, collect, and report chronic disease data that are important to public health practice and available for states, territories and large metropolitan areas. In addition to providing access to state-specific indicator data, the CDI web site serves as a gateway to additional information and data resources.
* [Graph of Rates of Teeth Cleaning During Pregnancy](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/d/pmxu-gsdm) - 2011. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). PRAMS, the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, is a surveillance system collecting state-specific, population-based data on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. It is a collaborative project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments. PRAMS provides data for state health officials to use to improve the health of mothers and infants. PRAMS topics include abuse, alcohol use, contraception, breastfeeding, mental health, morbidity, obesity, preconception health, pregnancy history, prenatal-care, sleep behavior, smoke exposure, stress, tobacco use, WIC, Medicaid, infant health, and unintended pregnancy. Data will be updated annually as it becomes available.
* [Diabetic Retinopathy (Age-adjusted Prevalence)](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/d/ht3t-s94t) - In 2013 and subsequently, one question in the core of BRFSS asks about vision: Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses? From 2005-2011 the BRFSS employed a ten question vision module regarding vision impairment, access and utilization of eye care, and self-reported eye diseases. The Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System is intended to provide population estimates of vision loss function, eye diseases, health disparities, as well as barriers and facilitators to access to vision and eye care. This information can be used for designing, implementing, and evaluating vision and eye health prevention programs.
* [Ami Test Chart 2](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/d/866z-nqgu) - CDC's Division of Population Health provides cross-cutting set of 124 indicators that were developed by consensus and that allows states and territories and large metropolitan areas to uniformly define, collect, and report chronic disease data that are important to public health practice and available for states, territories and large metropolitan areas. In addition to providing access to state-specific indicator data, the CDI web site serves as a gateway to additional information and data resources.
* [Age-related Macular Degeneration (Age-Adjusted Prevalence)](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/d/nusu-icam) - In 2013 and subsequently, one question in the core of BRFSS asks about vision: Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses? From 2005-2011 the BRFSS employed a ten question vision module regarding vision impairment, access and utilization of eye care, and self-reported eye diseases. The Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System is intended to provide population estimates of vision loss function, eye diseases, health disparities, as well as barriers and facilitators to access to vision and eye care.
