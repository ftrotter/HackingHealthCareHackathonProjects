* [WA Soils](https://data.wa.gov/d/e76j-28nj) - Information for SOILS data layer was derived from the Private Forest Land Grading system (PFLG) and subsequent soil surveys. PFLG was a five-year mapping program completed in 1980 for the purpose of forestland taxation. It was funded by the Washington State Department of Revenue. The Department of Natural Resources, Soil Conservation Service (now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service or NRCS), USDA Forest Service and Washington State University conducted soil mapping cooperatively following national soil survey standards. Private lands having the potential of supporting commercial forests were surveyed along with interspersed small areas of State lands, Indian tribal lands, and federal lands. Because this was a cooperative soil survey project, agricultural and non-commercial forestlands were included within some survey areas. After the Department of Natural Resources originally developed its geographic information system, digitized soil map unit delineations and a few soil attributes were transferred to the system. Remaining PFLG soil attributes were later added and are now available through associated lookup tables. SCS (NRCS) soils data on agricultural lands also have been subsequently added to this data layer. The SOILS data layer includes approximately 1,100 townships with wholly or partially digitized soils data. State and private lands which have the potential of supporting commercial forest stands were surveyed. Some Indian tribal and federal lands were surveyed. Because this was a cooperative soils survey project, agricultural and non-commercial forestlands were also included within some survey areas. After the Department of Natural Resources originally developed its geographic information system, digitized soils delineations and a few soil attributes were transferred to the system. Remaining PFLG soil attributes were added at a later time and are now available through associated lookup tables. SCS soils data on agricultural lands also have subsequently been added to this data layer. This layer includes approximately 1, 100 townships with wholly or partially digitized soils data (2,101 townships would provide complete coverage of the state of Washington).- The soils_sv resolves one to many relationships and as such is one of those special &quot;DNR&quot; spatial views ( ie. is implemented similar to a feature class). Column names may not match between SOILS_SV and the originating datasets.
Use limitations This Spatial View is available to Washingotn DNR users and those with access to the Washington State Uplands IMS site. The following cautions only apply to one-to-many and many-to-many spatial views!
Use these in the metadata only if the SV is one-to-many or many-to-many. CAUTIONS:
Area and Length Calculations: Use care when summarizing or totaling area or length calculations from spatial views with one-to-many or many-to-many relationships. One-to-many or many-to-many relationships between tabular and spatial data create multiple features in the same geometry. In other words, if there are two or more records in the table that correspond to the same feature (a single polygon, line or point), the spatial view will contain an identical copy of that feature's geometry for every corresponding record in the table. Area and length calculations should be performed carefully, to ensure they are not being exaggerated by including copies of the same feature's geometry. Symbolizing Spatial Features: Use care when symbolizing data in one-to-many or many-to-many spatial views. If there are multiple attributes tied to the same feature, symbolizing with a solid fill may mask other important features within the spatial view. This can be most commonly seen when symbolizing features based on a field with multiple table records. Labeling Spatial Features:
Spatial views with one-to-many or many-to-many relationships may present duplicate labels for those features with multiple table records. This is becau

* [DSHS Behavioral Health Organization Regions](https://data.wa.gov/d/89df-ua3a) - <div>DSHS and the state Health Care Authority (HCA) jointly designated Regional Service Areas (RSAs) in June 2015, following legislative authorization in 2014. RSAs define new geographical boundaries for the state to purchase behavioral and physical health care through managed care contracts. They are not administrative authorities. Behavioral Health Organizations (BHOs) are located within newly formed Regional Service Areas (RSAs). There is one BHO per RSA, except for the Southwest Washington RSA, which has a contract with the Health Care Authority for managed care plans. RSAs join and include contiguous counties, contain at least 60,000 people on Medicaid, possess an adequate number of health care providers, and reflect natural physical and behavioral health service referral patterns.

* [DAHP - Government Land Office maps (GLOs) Trails](https://data.wa.gov/d/aex8-qepz) - <p>Government Land Office maps (GLOs) are a result of the effort to survey all United States public lands before settlement. Starting in 1812 land was divided into square six mile blocks called townships, then subdivided into sections and ranges. Each subdivided area was surveyed and given its own map or GLO. During this process surveyors were required to indicate cultural resources such as roads and Indian trails and standardized symbols were used to represent geographic features. These GLOs are now maintained by the Bureau of Land Management as part of the official Land Status and Cadastral Survey records. As land was divided into parcels of individual ownership additional cadastral survey maps were created over time. For this reason there are often multiple GLOs or &quot;cadastral survey maps&quot; for one township / range, generally numbered one through four. For this seamless GLO layer, DAHP focused solely on the more historical GLOs which were usually listed as image number one or two for that specific township / range in the BLM Cadastral Survey records. In some cases no GLOs were available for review. Such areas included National Forest Lands, National Parks, Indian Reservations, and remote wilderness areas.<br /></p>

* [WA DNR Managed Land Parcels](https://data.wa.gov/d/sz58-nyf3) - The Parcel layer consists of parcels that are areas land in which the Department of Natural Resources holds some interest and are located anywhere in the upland area of the State of Washington. Three types of Parcels are currently held in the parcel layer. The number of Parcel types may increase in the future. Ownership Parcels, parcel type code 1, consist of Washington State owned land managed by the Department of Natural Resources. Most ownership parcels are held and managed for the benefit of some trust such as the Common School and Indemnity trust. Of the several parcel types, only Ownership Parcels represent the entire extent of the particular type of land managed by DNR. The other parcel types are incomplete data sets. Disposed Parcels, parcel type code 2, consist of ownership parcels that have been disposed of since July 1, 2007. A very few parcels disposed of prior to that date are also included. Easement Parcels, parcel type code 3, consist of various types of easements acquired for the State by the Department. Some of the Easements are negative easements over land not owned by the State, for example Conservation Easements which remove certain development rights away for the parcel owner. Other Easements are positive rights acquired by the State, such as roadway easements.<br /><a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dnr/adminsa/GisData/metadata/cadastre_parcel.htm" target="_blank">WA DNR Managed Land Parcels Metadata</a>

In 2016, the PDC implemented a new system for managing lobbyist reports and electronic filing. The layout of these records is incompatible with the 2016 and later record layout. Please refer to the "Lobbyist Compensation and Expenses by Source" dataset for 2016 and later records. This dataset contains compensation and expense summary records from the monthly reports of lobbying activity. One record is included for each client that paid compensation or incurred expenses during the filing period. If the lobbyist firm themselves incurred any expenses not reimbursed by a client, a record is included summarizing the lobbyist firm's expenses. If a lobbyist reported no compensation or expenses on the report, no records will be in this dataset. Records are included for the period from 10 years prior to the current date to the end of 2015. The date is determined as the filing period of the report, not the date received. Records are included for the full year so for example, all 2007 records will be included until the entire year 2007 falls outside the 10 year time span.

* [Lobbyist Agents](https://data.wa.gov/d/bp5b-jrti) - This dataset contains information about the agents employed by a lobbying firm and the employers they ultimately lobby for. See the Lobbyist Agent Employers dataset for each individual lobbyist agent to employer relationship. A lobbyist/firm registers with the PDC, not individual agents (employees) of that firm. The PDC provides this data as a way to see the individuals that lobby for a firm and all the employers of that firm. This does not indicate that a particular agent necessarily lobbied for a particular employer, merely that the agent's firm lobbied for that employer. This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification. Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.

* [Debt Reported by Candidates and Political Committees](https://data.wa.gov/d/3r6b-hsaa) - This dataset contains debts, obligations, and orders placed by Washington State Candidates and Political committees for the last 10 years as reported to the PDC on Schedule B to the C4 Summary Report. Loans are not included in this dataset. Loans, however, are a debt but are contained in the Loan dataset. For candidates, the number of years is determined by the year of the election, not necessarily the year the expenditure was reported. For political committees, the number of years is determined by the calendar year of the reporting period. Candidates and political committees choosing to file under "mini reporting" are not included in this dataset. See WAC 390-16-105 for information regarding eligibility.

* [Percents of Chronic Conditions among Fee-for-Service Medicare Beneficiaries, Washington State and Counties, 2007-2014](https://data.wa.gov/d/qb7g-hu6x) - (Source: CMS Medicare Chronic Conditions Public Use File, January 2016)
* [Broadband Adoption and Computer Use by year, state, demographic characteristics](https://data.wa.gov/d/8sap-vzbp) - This dataset is imported from the US Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and its "Data Explorer" site. The underlying data comes from the US Census 1. dataset: Specifies the month and year of the survey as a string, in "Mon YYYY" format. The CPS is a monthly survey, and NTIA periodically sponsors Supplements to that survey. 2. variable: Contains the standardized name of the variable being measured. NTIA identified the availability of similar data across Supplements, and assigned variable names to ease time-series comparisons. 3. description: Provides a concise description of the variable. 4. universe: Specifies the variable representing the universe of persons or households included in the variable's statistics. The specified variable is always included in the file. The only variables lacking universes are isPerson and isHouseholder, as they are themselves the broadest universes measured in the CPS. 5. A large number of *Prop, *PropSE, *Count, and *CountSE columns comprise the remainder of the columns. For each demographic being measured (see below), four statistics are produced, including the estimated proportion of the group for which the variable is true (*Prop), the standard error of that proportion (*PropSE), the estimated number of persons or households in that group for which the variable is true (*Count), and the standard error of that count (*CountSE). DEMOGRAPHIC CATEGORIES 1. us: The usProp, usPropSE, usCount, and usCountSE columns contain statistics about all persons and households in the universe (which represents the population of the fifty states and the District and Columbia). For example, to see how the prevelance of Internet use by Americans has changed over time, look at the usProp column for each survey's internetUser variable. 2. age: The age category is divided into five ranges: ages 3-14, 15-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65+. The CPS only includes data on Americans ages 3 and older. Also note that household reference persons must be at least 15 years old, so the age314* columns are blank for household-based variables. Those columns are also blank for person-based variables where the universe is "isAdult" (or a sub-universe of "isAdult"), as the CPS defines adults as persons ages 15 or older. Finally, note that some variables where children are technically in the univese will show zero values for the age314* columns. This occurs in cases where a variable simply cannot be true of a child (e.g. the workInternetUser variable, as the CPS presumes children under 15 are not eligible to work), but the topic of interest is relevant to children (e.g. locations of Internet use). 3. work: Employment status is divided into "Employed," "Unemployed," and "NILF" (Not in the Labor Force). These three categories reflect the official BLS definitions used in official labor force statistics. Note that employment status is only recorded in the CPS for individuals ages 15 and older. As a result, children are excluded from the universe when calculating statistics by work status, even if they are otherwise considered part of the universe for the variable of interest. 4. income: The income category represents annual family income, rather than just an individual person's income. It is divided into five ranges: below $25K, $25K-49,999, $50K-74,999, $75K-99,999, and $100K or more. Statistics by income group are only available in this file for Supplements beginning in 2010; prior to 2010, family income range is available in public use datasets, but is not directly comparable to newer datasets due to the 2010 introduction of the practice of allocating "don't know," "refused," and other responses that result in missing data. Prior to 2010, family income is unkown for approximately 20 percent of persons, while in 2010 the Census Bureau began imputing likely income ranges to replace missing data. 5. education: Educational attainment is divided into "No Diploma," "High School Grad,
