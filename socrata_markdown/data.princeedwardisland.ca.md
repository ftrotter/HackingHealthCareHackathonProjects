* [OD0003 Pesticide Analysis For Stream Sediment](https://data.princeedwardisland.ca/d/6pqx-x5hu) - This data set provides pesticide sample analyses results for stream sediment samples for the province’s Pesticide Monitoring Program. The sampling includes sampling a total of nine rivers across PEI, with three of the rivers being sampled each year.

Sediment samples are collected once in July, twice in August (once during a normal/dry weather and once during wet weather), and once in September. The two samples in July and September are collected during dry weather.

Sediment sampling involves Department staff collecting sediment from the stream bed of the site, using a small shovel.  Samples are then sent to a laboratory for analysis.

These samples are collected in the same rivers as the Stream Water and the Finfish/Shellfish Pesticide datasets.* [Line Chart of Acute Care Hospital Expenditures from 2010](https://data.princeedwardisland.ca/d/6ph8-ms44) - This data set provides an analysis of acute care hospital expenditures for Prince Edward Island, 2010/11 to 2014/15.<br /><br />Hospital operating account expenditures represents funding provided by Government net of revenue to support Acute and Community Hospitals including lab and diagnostic imaging services, dialysis services and hospital pharmacy services.<br /><br />The number of In-Province Acute Care beds includes only those located in the seven hospitals. Expenditures include in-patient as well as outpatient expenditures.* [OD0050 Health PEI Facility Locations](https://data.princeedwardisland.ca/d/dfge-zd27) - This data set provides geographic information for Health PEI facilities (Hospitals, Cancer Treatment Centres, Palliative Care Centre, Primary Care Networks, and Public Nursing Homes* [Chart of Pesticides by River from 2009](https://data.princeedwardisland.ca/d/mkga-8mcq) - This data set provides pesticide sample analyses results for stream water samples for the province’s Pesticide Monitoring Program. The sampling includes a total of nine rivers across PEI, with three of the rivers being sampled each year.<br /><br />Stream water samples are collected once in July, twice in August (once during a normal/dry weather day and once during wet weather), and once in September. The two samples in July and September are collected during dry weather. Department staff collects the samples, which are then sent to a laboratory for analysis.<br /><br />Results with a "<" represent values below the lab's reporting limit. Such results do not confirm the presence nor the absence of a pesticide compound below that level.* [OD0004 Pesticide Analysis For Drinking Water](https://data.princeedwardisland.ca/d/iy5f-uq43) - This data set provides pesticide sample analyses results for drinking water samples for the province’s Pesticide Monitoring Program.

Over 100 wells are monitored annually, with samples being collected in drinking water wells of private homes, schools, municipalities, and seniors’ housing facilities.  Sampling of the wells is conducted each January/February by Departmental staff. The samples are sent to a laboratory in New Brunswick for analysis. The purpose of the program is to monitor the environment for the presence of pesticide residues.

To create a long-term record of pesticide detections in drinking water, the same sites are sampled each year. Individual site locations are not listed to respect the privacy of the individuals involved, as this is a voluntary program for all participants. Public buildings (e.g., schools and seniors’ housing) are identified. The non-public building sites are listed as letter/number  combinations (e.g. A1, AA, FFF, etc.) The designations remain consistent for each site from year to year.

The dataset also includes chemistry analyses for the sites.  Additional water samples were collected at the same time as the pesticide sampling, which were then analyzed at the PEI Analytical Laboratory for various chemistry parameters.  Users should note that the parameters analysed and the lab detection limits for these chemistry samples/results may vary from year to year. Chemistry sampling ceased after the 2013 sampling year.

Results with a "<" represent values below the lab's reporting limit. Such results do not confirm the presence nor the absence of a pesticide compound below that level.

Safe Drinking Water Limits (Pesticides)
The pesticide data also includes a safe drinking water limit (if one is available). The four sources of safe drinking water limits are listed below:

    Canadian Drinking Water Quality Guideline Value
    Health Canada Guidance Value
    USEPA Pesticide Tolerance Level
    Guidance value not available, Health Canada has indicated detected levels are below levels of concern

Only compounds that have been detected through the monitoring program or which have a Canadian Drinking Water Guideline Value have a safe drinking water limit value listed.

Some of the guideline values have been converted from the published units of ug/L to ng/ml in order to compare the guideline values to the results.

Health Canada provides The Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality (link is external).

Chemistry Samples

The chemistry results were compiled from three different databases, and may utilize different parameters and units/limits:

    results previous to 2009
    results between 2010 and 2012
    results after June 2012* [OD0030 Physician, Hospital And Nursing Home Statistics from 2009](https://data.princeedwardisland.ca/d/76n9-ph3c) - An analysis of physician, hospital, and nursing home statistics for Prince Edward Island, from 2009.

The number of practicing physicians is the number of full-time equivalent positions filled by physicians as of December of each year.  It does not include locum or out-of-province visiting physicians.The number of funded beds in licensed private nursing homes is as of December of each year. 

Prince Edward Home beds – note that from 2009 to 2013, the numbers include convalescent/restorative beds, as well as beds for under 60 year old residents.  In 2014 a new Prince Edward Home was constructed.* [Chart of Seniors Home Repair Program Activity](https://data.princeedwardisland.ca/d/4whd-5itm) - Seniors Home Repair Program Activity starting with the year 2009/2010
