* [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey: 2009](https://health.data.ny.gov/d/rivb-kr3f) - The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual statewide telephone surveillance system designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non-institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older. Although the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available.

The color of the points represent whether the infection ratio is significantly higher, significantly lower, or not significantly different from the NYS average (SIR=1) for the same year. The infection ratio for some acute care hospitals cannot be compared to the NYS average infection ratio because there were less than 20 procedures. All acute care hospitals are required to report certain hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) to the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH). This includes central line-associated blood stream infections; surgical site infections following colon, hip replacement/revision, hysterectomy, and coronary artery bypass graft; Clostridium difficile infections, and carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections. PLEASE NOTE: Because of the complicated nature of the risk-adjustment methodology used to produce the HAI rates, the advice of a statistician is recommended before attempting to manipulate the data. Hospital-specific risk-adjusted rates cannot simply be combined. In addition, due to NYSDOH validation audits which may involve data from both the current and previous calendar year, a revised data file will be published the year after the original data file was released.

The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available.

* [HAI: Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infection Overall Standardized Infection Ratio Map: 2017](https://health.data.ny.gov/d/dr4m-hyrn) - The point map shows the Central Line - Associated Blood Stream Infection (CLABSI) overall standardized infection ratio (SIR) reported for acute care hospitals. The SIR summarizes performance across different types of intensive care units and wards. The color of the points represent whether the infection ratio is significantly higher, significantly lower, or the same as the NYS average (SIR=1) for the same year. The infection ratio for some acute care hospitals cannot be compared to the NYS average infection ratio because there were less than 50 central line days. All acute care hospitals are required to report certain hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) to the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH). This includes central line-associated blood stream infections in intensive care units; surgical site infections following colon, hip replacement/revision, hysterectomy, and coronary artery bypass graft; and Clostridium difficile infections. PLEASE NOTE: Because of the complicated nature of the risk-adjustment methodology used to produce the HAI rates, the advice of a statistician is recommended before attempting to manipulate the data. Hospital-specific risk-adjusted rates cannot simply be combined. In addition, due to NYSDOH validation audits which may involve data from both the current and previous calendar year, a revised data file will be published the year after the original data file was released.
