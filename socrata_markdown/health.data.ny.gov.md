The SIR summarizes performance across different types of intensive care units and wards.  The color of the points represent whether the infection ratio is significantly higher, significantly lower, or the same as the NYS average (SIR=1) for the same year. The infection ratio for some acute care hospitals cannot be compared to the NYS average infection ratio because there were less than 50 central line days.  All acute care hospitals are required to report certain hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) to the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH).  This includes central line-associated blood stream infections in intensive care units; surgical site infections following colon, hip replacement/revision, hysterectomy, and coronary artery bypass graft; and Clostridium difficile infections. PLEASE NOTE: Because of the complicated nature of the risk-adjustment methodology used to produce the HAI rates, the advice of a statistician is recommended before attempting to manipulate the data.  Hospital-specific risk-adjusted rates cannot simply be combined. In addition, due to NYSDOH validation audits which may involve data from both the current and previous calendar year, a revised data file will be published the year after the original data file was released.

These periods relate to the general age of the housing.  Older housing can present health and safety hazards to their residents.  In addition, these groupings coincide with the presence of lead in paint, a health hazard for young children.
For dwellings visited by the Clinton County HNP, this chart displays the percent of homes built in each period by funding cycle.  For example, the first set of bars shows the percent of dwellings that were built before 1950 during each of the 3 funding cycles.  We can see that Clinton County has increased the percent of the oldest homes from about 10% in the first funding cycle to almost 30% during the current funding cycle.  Looking at the orange bars, we see that during the current funding cycle, Clinton County’s HNP has visited about the same percentage of homes built in each time period.
The counties participating in the Healthy Neighborhoods Program can create this type of chart to view trends in how they are targeting their visits.  For example, if a county wants to reach older homes, it may want to refocus its efforts on communities with older housing stock.

The chart gives an indication of the ability of the HNP environmental intervention to decrease the prevalence of mice in the home.  The HNP pest control intervention involves providing products (such as traps and cleaning supplies) and educating residents about removing harborage and food for pests by storing garbage appropriately, cleaning, and repairing holes that give mice entry into the home.  In some cases, the HNP contacts local code enforcement or the landlord.
We can see that the initial visit percentages vary substantially across the across counties, which could reflect differing geography, urban versus rural target areas, and the quality of the housing stock.  Except for one county, the homes that were selected for a revisit have a lower percentage with mice homes that had an initial visit, indicating an overall reduction in the percentage of homes with mice after the HNP intervention, although mice were not eradicated from all the homes.  Oneida and Cortland Counties show no mice in the revisited homes, which could be an indication of success of the intervention and/or the selection of homes to revisit.  For Westchester County, it is possible that the homes that the revisited homes were the worst and, therefore, had a higher percentage.  These three counties demonstrate why the comparisons need to be interpreted with caution.  Because revisits are a subset of the initial visits, the comparison has limitations.
