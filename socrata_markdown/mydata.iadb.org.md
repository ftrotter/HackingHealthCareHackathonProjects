* [Internal and External Debt: Share in Total Public Debt (Data as of December 2015)](https://mydata.iadb.org/d/x8jt-a9ve) - The availability of valid, comparable, and standardized public debt data is essential for the implementation of sound policies in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This is why at the core of the LAC Debt Group initiative is the development of a standardized sovereign debt database to help debt managers, policy makers, and other actors of financial markets analyze the evolution and composition of public debt in LAC and conduct cross-country comparisons. The information of the database is provided by the public debt offices of LAC countries in response to a questionnaire specifically designed to allow comparability of data. The questionnaire, whose response is non-compulsory, is intended to compile up-to-date standardized statistics for objective and homogeneous definitions of public debt. This update corresponds to the period: II Semester 2006 â€“ II Semester 2015.<br><br><b>Click here to access the data: https://mydata.iadb.org/idb/dataset/3bvi-edbq</b></br></br>
