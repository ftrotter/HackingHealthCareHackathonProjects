Due to the limitations of the platform, the data is not displayed how it is meant to be viewed. Please see the dark red “About” tab for a thumbnail of how the map is ideally viewed and two attachments. One attachment is a description of the metadata and the other attachment provides instructions for how to view the data properly. 
The Strategic Areas show the degree to which City of Austin initiatives overlap each other geographically, representing opportunities for collaboration and coordination of capital investment related to implementing the Imagine Austin Comprehensive Plan. 
The data set is comprised of initiatives that have been formally adopted by City Council or are from department-approved planning documents/reports. Examples include the Imagine Austin Growth Concept map, City Council-approved infrastructure master plans (i.e. the City of Austin Sidewalk Master Plan), City Council-approved Neighborhood Plans, and City Council and/or departmental accepted reports (i.e. the Hispanic-Latino Quality of Life Initiative final report). These initiatives contain recommendations for areas to invest in or focus on certain capital improvements, the geographical boundaries of which are represented in the data set. The areas with the greatest number of overlapping initiatives are indicated by the darker shades, representing areas where capital investment can have a multiplier effect in implementing several city initiatives.
The data is organized around Imagine Austin Priority Program topic areas: Compact and Connected, Nature and City, Creativity and Economy, Healthy and Affordable. The purpose of the LRCSP Strategic Investment Areas Overlay Analysis is to support the identification of: (a) Strategic investment in infrastructure that implements Imagine Austin, (b) Potential cost savings and other efficiencies and (c) Improved outcomes for our capital investments. NOTE: the areas are updated periodically to respond to changes in City plans and policies as reflected in City Council-approved initiatives. 
*The Long-Range CIP Strategic Plan is produced annually, and the Planning Commission uses the plan to make its annual recommendation to the City Manager about projects necessary or desirable to implement the comprehensive plan, per its role in the City Charter.

Each of the homes reduces its energy use by an average of about 1,200 kilowatt-hours annually due to these improvements. The program provides up to $1,500 in home improvements including installation of attic insulation, sealing and repair of ducts, solar screen installations, weather stripping around entry doors, and minor home repairs necessary to improve the effectiveness of the efficiency improvements.

In FY 2010, Austin Energy received a grant of nearly $5.9 million from American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds that allowed for the weatherization of 1,064 homes and apartments for low-income, elderly, and disabled customers within Austin Energy’s service area. Under this program, each dwelling received, on average, about $5,000 worth of improvements including new energy efficient appliances and air conditioning and heating equipment.

Because Austin Energy's implementation of the program was so successful, the utility received additional funding on three separate occasions in the amounts of $2.1 million, $200,000 and $1 million, for total funds of $9.2 million. This allowed the utility to nearly double the number of units receiving this enhanced free weatherization. 
Under the Federal Weatherization Program which ended April 30, 2012, Austin Energy weatherized  1,886 homes, 77% more than the original goal of 1,064 homes. The homes were occupied by 4,529 people of whom 645 were elderly, 572 had disabilities and 758 were children under the age of 5. On average, each of the homes will save about 1,200 kilowatt-hours annually in energy costs due to the improvements.

*In FY 2010 127 of the 456 homes received weatherization through the use of ARRA funds. 
*In FY 2011 all homes received weatherization through the use of ARRA funds. 
*In FY 2012, the 715 homes used both ARRA funds and AE funds.
*Numbers are lower than expected in FY 2013 due to the late start of the program efforts.* [Annual Report EMS Public Information Office Activities](https://data.austintexas.gov/d/hghw-zjns) - This table shows activities done by the ATCEMS Public Information Office.* [EMS - Spring Festival Season 2018 - Incident Summary](https://data.austintexas.gov/d/s2fs-y8mx) - A summary of incidents for Spring Festival Season 2018* [Materials Expenditures per Capita](https://data.austintexas.gov/stories/s/kgyw-gzms) - * [EMS - FY2016 Top 10 Primary Impressions](https://data.austintexas.gov/d/qnvv-hkw2) - ** Static Data Set ** This table shows the 10 primary impressions most frequently recorded  by ATCEMS field personnel during fiscal year 2016.

Due to the limitations of the platform, the data is not displayed how it is meant to be viewed. Please see the dark red “About” tab for a thumbnail of how the map is ideally viewed and two attachments. One attachment is a description of the metadata and the other attachment provides instructions for how to view the data properly.
The Strategic Investment Areas map shows the geographic location of unfunded or long-term infrastructure needs identified in the FY 2016-17 LRCSP and the degree to which those future investments could enable recommendations in multiple City of Austin initiatives, as identified in the LRCSP Strategic Areas map (see the CPO LRCSP Strategic Areas dataset on the Open Data Portal). The degree of overlap with multiple City initiatives is indicated by darker shades. The goal of the analysis is to identify strategic areas for collaboration and coordination of capital investment related to implementing Imagine Austin. The data is organized around Imagine Austin Priority Program topic areas: Compact and Connected, Nature and City, Creativity and Economy, Healthy and Affordable. The purpose of the LRCSP Strategic Investment Areas Overlay Analysis is to support the identification of: (a) Strategic investment in infrastructure that implements Imagine Austin, (b) Potential cost savings and other efficiencies and (c) Improved outcomes for our capital investments. NOTE: the areas are updated periodically to respond to changes in both infrastructure needs and City plans and policies, as reflected in City Council-approved initiatives.
*The Long-Range CIP Strategic Plan is produced annually, and the Planning Commission uses the plan to make its annual recommendation to the City Manager about projects necessary or desirable to implement the comprehensive plan, per its role in the City Charter.

As a broad racial category, Asian Americans are the fastest-growing minority group in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). The growth rate of 42.9% in Asian Americans between 2000 and 2010 is phenomenal given that the corresponding figure for the U.S. total population is only 9.3% (see Figure 1). Currently, Asian Americans make up 5.6% of the total U.S. population and are projected to reach 10% by 2050. It is particularly notable that Asians have recently overtaken Hispanics as the largest group of new immigrants to the U.S. (Pew Research Center, 2015). The rapid growth rate and unique challenges as a new immigrant group call for a better understanding of the social and health needs of the Asian American population.* [Austin Public Health Locations](https://data.austintexas.gov/d/6v78-dj3u) - This data set shows locations at which Austin Public Health has a presence, those locations with office hours contain service providers.
