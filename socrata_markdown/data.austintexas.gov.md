Due to the limitations of the platform, the data is not displayed how it is meant to be viewed. Please see the dark red “About” tab for a thumbnail of how the map is ideally viewed and two attachments. One attachment is a description of the metadata and the other attachment provides instructions for how to view the data properly.
The Strategic Investment Areas map shows the geographic location of unfunded or long-term infrastructure needs identified in the FY 2016-17 LRCSP and the degree to which those future investments could enable recommendations in multiple City of Austin initiatives, as identified in the LRCSP Strategic Areas map (see the CPO LRCSP Strategic Areas dataset on the Open Data Portal). The degree of overlap with multiple City initiatives is indicated by darker shades. The goal of the analysis is to identify strategic areas for collaboration and coordination of capital investment related to implementing Imagine Austin. The data is organized around Imagine Austin Priority Program topic areas: Compact and Connected, Nature and City, Creativity and Economy, Healthy and Affordable. The purpose of the LRCSP Strategic Investment Areas Overlay Analysis is to support the identification of: (a) Strategic investment in infrastructure that implements Imagine Austin, (b) Potential cost savings and other efficiencies and (c) Improved outcomes for our capital investments. NOTE: the areas are updated periodically to respond to changes in both infrastructure needs and City plans and policies, as reflected in City Council-approved initiatives.
*The Long-Range CIP Strategic Plan is produced annually, and the Planning Commission uses the plan to make its annual recommendation to the City Manager about projects necessary or desirable to implement the comprehensive plan, per its role in the City Charter.

As a broad racial category, Asian Americans are the fastest-growing minority group in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). The growth rate of 42.9% in Asian Americans between 2000 and 2010 is phenomenal given that the corresponding figure for the U.S. total population is only 9.3% (see Figure 1). Currently, Asian Americans make up 5.6% of the total U.S. population and are projected to reach 10% by 2050. It is particularly notable that Asians have recently overtaken Hispanics as the largest group of new immigrants to the U.S. (Pew Research Center, 2015). The rapid growth rate and unique challenges as a new immigrant group call for a better understanding of the social and health needs of the Asian American population.* [Austin Public Health Locations](https://data.austintexas.gov/d/6v78-dj3u) - This data set shows locations at which Austin Public Health has a presence, those locations with office hours contain service providers.
