While the Referring Provider DMEPOS PUF has a wealth of information on payment and utilization for Medicare DMEPOS services, the dataset has a number of limitations.  Of particular importance is the fact that the data may not be representative of a physician’s entire practice as it only includes information on Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.  In addition, the data are not intended to indicate the quality of care provided and are not risk-adjusted to account for differences in underlying severity of disease of patient populations.

This dataset presents data on Calendar Year 2015 financial reconciliation and quality performance results for ACOs with 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 agreement start dates. ACOs that generated savings earned a performance payment if they met the quality standard.
 
Notes: 1 - (Gross) Generated savings: Total savings (first to last dollar) for ACOs whose savings equaled or exceeded their minimum savings rates (variable based on ACO size under Track 1 and flat 2% under Track 2). This amount does not account for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance, reduction due to sequestration or repayment of advance payments (for ACOs participating in the Advance Payment model and ACO Investment Model, AIM). 2 - (Gross) Generated losses: Total losses (first to last dollar) for Track 2 ACOs whose losses equaled or exceeded their minimum loss rate (flat 2%). This amount does not account for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance. 3 - Earned shared savings: The ACO’s share of savings for ACOs whose savings equaled or exceeded their minimum savings rates (variable based on ACO size under Track 1 and flat 2% under Track 2), and that were eligible for a performance payment because they met the program’s quality performance standard. This amount accounts for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance (up to 50% under Track 1 and up to 60% under Track 2), as well as the reduction in performance payment due to sequestration. This amount does not account for repayment of advance payments. 4 - Owed losses: The ACO’s share of losses for Track 2 ACOs whose losses equaled or exceeded their minimum loss rate (flat 2%). This amount accounts for the application of the ACO’s final loss sharing rate (which does not exceed 60%) based on quality performance. 5 - Met the Quality Performance Standard: An ACO must meet the quality performance standard to be eligible to share in any savings generated. For the 2015 performance year, any ACO that did not completely report quality data did not meet the quality performance standard. The quality performance standard for ACOs with 2015 start dates that are in their first performance year is based on complete and accurate reporting of all required quality measures for Calendar Year 2015. ACOs beyond the first performance year of their first agreement period must also meet minimum attainment (which is ≥30% or ≥30th percentile benchmark) on at least one Pay for Performance measure in each domain in order to meet the quality performance standard. 6 - Quality Score: ACOs with 2015 start dates will have a “P4R” (Pay for Reporting) displayed for the Quality Score to reflect that their quality performance is based on complete and accurate reporting.

 ^ - Measures marked with a caret (^) are measures where a lower performance rate is indicative of better quality.

 ACOs that did not successfully report CAHPS measures in 2015 will have a dash "-" displayed for CAHPS measures (ACO-1 through ACO-7 and ACO-34). ACOs that did not successfully report GPRO Web Interface measures in 2015 will have a dash "-" displayed for GPRO Web Interface measures (ACO-13 through ACO-33 and ACO-39 through ACO-41). These measure fields appear as blank cells in the downloaded file (the dash is not displayed).

For measures ACO-13 through ACO-33 and ACO-39 through ACO-41, if no beneficiaries were eligible for this measure due to the measure's inclusion/exclusion criteria, then an "N/A" (Not Applicable) will appear in the place of a performance rate.

The total drug cost includes the ingredient cost of the medication, dispensing fees, sales tax, and any applicable administration fees and is based on the amount paid by the Part D plan, Medicare beneficiary, government subsidies, and any other third-party payers.

Although the Part D Prescriber PUF has a wealth of information on payment and utilization for Medicare Part D prescriptions, the dataset has a number of limitations. Of particular importance is the fact that the data may not be representative of a physician’s entire practice or all of Medicare as it only includes information on beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (i.e., approximately two-thirds of all Medicare beneficiaries). In addition, the data are not intended to indicate the quality of care provided.

The file names are CLIA and OTHER. If downloading the file, note it is fairly large (125MB in CSV).
The POS Extract is created from the QIES (Quality Improvement Evaluation System) database. These data include provider number, name, and address and characterize the participating institutional providers. The data are collected through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Regional Offices. The file contains an individual record for each Medicare-approved provider and is updated quarterly. For a list of provider types, layout files, and how to order previous annual files, please see the Source Link in the About tab.

Two data issues in the CLIA POS file have been resolved as of the 2nd Quarter 2016 file. The data issues occurred in CLIA POS files starting with the 2nd Quarter 2011 file through 1st quarter 2016.

Data Issue 1: Incorrect Certificate Data
Certificate data in the CLIA POS file should always come from the lab's current effective certificate. Due to a sorting issue, certificate data from a lab's pending or historical certificates were used and the lab's current effective certificate data was not used.

The most important aspects of this file are as follow: 1. It contains claims for a simple random sample of 5% of the 2008 beneficiary population. Out of approximately 2.4 million beneficiaries in the 5% sample, about 350,000 had claims (after excluding a relatively small fraction of ineligible claims), resulting in a Public Use File of just under 590,000 claims. 2. It contains six (6) analytic variables (in addition to an encrypted claim key): Age, gender, base DRG code, ICD-9 code, claim cost, and length of inpatient stay. All of these variables, except gender, have been suitably aggregated or averaged in order to protect individuals from identification, while retaining the analytic value of the data. 3. A claim for a sampled beneficiary is only included in the PUF if the combination of all six (6) variables is shared by at least eleven (11) claims pertaining to at least eleven (11) distinct beneficiaries in the population (but not necessarily the sample). 4. Claims cannot be linked by beneficiary, and cannot be linked to any external data source by means of the claim ID. The claim ID is a cryptographic key specific to this Inpatient Claims PUF and not available elsewhere. The inpatient Claims PUF is sorted by this claim ID to ensure that the relative position of claims in the PUF and the original source data are totally uncorrelated.* [2016 Medicare Shared Savings Program Participants](https://data.cms.gov/d/82gp-26ev) - The Medicare Shared Savings Program (or Shared Savings Program) facilitates coordination among providers to improve the quality of care for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries while reducing the growth in health care costs.

Coverage for people living with such conditions as diabetes, asthma, cancer, and HIV/AIDS has often been priced out of the reach of most Americans who buy their own insurance, and this has resulted in a lack of coverage for millions. The temporary program covers a broad range of health benefits and is designed as a bridge for people with pre-existing conditions who cannot obtain health insurance coverage in today’s private insurance market.

The error has since been corrected and the accurate file was uploaded on 1/19/2016
In an effort to prepare the prescribers and Part D sponsors for the June 1, 2016, enforcement date, CMS is making available an enrollment file that identifies physician and eligible professional who are enrolled in Medicare in an approved or opt out status.   The file contains production data but is considered a test file since the Part D prescriber enrollment requirement is not yet applicable.  An updated enrollment file will be generated every two weeks and continue through the June 1, 2016 enforcement date.  

The file displays provider eligibility as of and after November 1, 2014 (i.e., currently enrolled, new approvals, or changes from opt-out to enrolled as of November 1, 2014).  Any inactive providers or periods of inactivity for existing providers prior to November 1, 2014, will not be displayed on the enrollment file. However, any enrollments that become inactive after November 1, 2014, will be on the file with its respective end dates for that given provider.   For opted out providers, the opt out flag will display a Y/N (Yes/No) value to indicate the periods the provider was opted out of Medicare.  The file will include the provider’s:

•	National Provider Identifier (NPI);
•	First and Last Name;
•	Effective and End Dates; and
•	Opt Out Flag* [CROSSWALK MEDICARE PROVIDER/SUPPLIER to HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TAXONOMY](https://data.cms.gov/d/j75i-rw8y) - This crosswalk links the types of providers and suppliers who are eligible to apply for enrollment in the Medicare program with the appropriate Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Codes.

The Part D Prescriber PUF is based on information from CMS’s Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse, which contains Prescription Drug Event records submitted by Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plans and by stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDP). The dataset identifies providers by their National Provider Identifier (NPI) and the specific prescriptions that were dispensed at their direction, listed by brand name (if applicable) and generic name. For each prescriber and drug, the dataset includes the total number of prescriptions that were dispensed, which include original prescriptions and any refills, and the total drug cost. The total drug cost includes the ingredient cost of the medication, dispensing fees, sales tax, and any applicable administration fees and is based on the amount paid by the Part D plan, Medicare beneficiary, government subsidies, and any other third-party payers.

Although the Part D Prescriber PUF has a wealth of information on payment and utilization for Medicare Part D prescriptions, the dataset has a number of limitations. Of particular importance is the fact that the data may not be representative of a physician’s entire practice or all of Medicare as it only includes information on beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (i.e., approximately two-thirds of all Medicare beneficiaries). In addition, the data are not intended to indicate the quality of care provided.

Coverage for people living with such conditions as diabetes, asthma, cancer, and HIV/AIDS has often been priced out of the reach of most Americans who buy their own insurance, and this has resulted in a lack of coverage for millions. The temporary program covers a broad range of health benefits and is designed as a bridge for people with pre-existing conditions who cannot obtain health insurance coverage in today’s private insurance market.

This dataset presents data on Calendar Year 2014 financial reconciliation and quality performance results for ACOs with 2012, 2013 and 2014 agreement start dates. ACOs that generated savings earned a performance payment if they met the quality standard. Quality performance for ACOs with 2014 start dates that are in their first performance year is based on complete and accurate reporting of all required quality measures for Calendar Year 2014. Notes: 1 - (Gross) Generated savings: Total savings (first to last dollar) for ACOs whose savings equaled or exceeded their minimum savings rates (variable based on ACO size under Track 1 and flat 2% under Track 2). This amount does not account for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance, reduction due to sequestration or repayment of advance payments. 2 - (Gross) Generated losses: Total losses (first to last dollar) for Track 2 ACOs whose losses equaled or exceeded their minimum loss rate (flat 2%). This amount does not account for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance. 3 - Total earned shared savings: The ACO’s share of savings for ACOs whose savings equaled or exceeded their minimum savings rates, and who were eligible for a performance payment because they met the program’s quality performance standard. This amount accounts for the application of the ACO’s final sharing rate based on quality performance (up to 50% under Track 1 and up to 60% under Track 2), as well as the reduction in performance payment due to sequestration. This amount does not account for repayment of advance payments. 4 - Total earned shared losses: The ACO’s share of losses for Track 2 ACOs whose losses equaled or exceeded their minimum loss rate (flat 2%). This amount accounts for the application of the ACO’s final loss sharing rate (which does not exceed 60%) based on quality performance. 5 - Successfully Reported Quality: ACOs are considered to have successfully reported quality if they completely reported in 2014. 6 - Quality Score: ACOs with 2014 start dates will have a “P4R” (Pay for Reporting) displayed for the Quality Score to reflect that their quality performance is based on complete and accurate reporting. For more information on how the Overall Quality Score was determined for ACOs with an Agreement Start Date in 2012 or 2013, please refer to the Medicare Shared Savings Program Quality Measure Benchmarks for the 2014 Reporting Year document posted on the Shared Savings Program website http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/sharedsavingsprogram/Quality_Measures_Standards.html.

The readmission rate equals the number of inpatient hospital stays classified as readmissions divided by the number of index stays for a given month.  Index stays include all inpatient hospital stays except those where the primary diagnosis was cancer treatment or rehabilitation.  Readmissions include stays where a beneficiary was admitted as an inpatient within 30 days of the discharge date following a previous index stay, except cases where a stay is considered always planned or potentially planned.  Planned readmissions include admissions for organ transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy/immunotherapy, and rehabilitation.  

This dataset has several limitations.  Readmissions rates are unadjusted for age, health status or other factors.  In addition, this dataset reports data for some months where claims are not yet final.  Data published for the most recent six months is preliminary and subject to change. Final data will be published as they become available, although the difference between preliminary and final readmission rates for a given month is likely to be less than 0.1 percentage point.

Data Source: The primary data source for these data is the CMS Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW), a database with 100% of Medicare enrollment and fee-for-service claims data. For complete information regarding data in the CCW, visit http://ccwdata.org/index.php.
