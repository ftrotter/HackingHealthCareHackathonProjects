* [Paid Family Leave (PFL) - Monthly Data](https://data.edd.ca.gov/d/r95e-fvkm) - The monthly summary report is intended to provide the user with a quick overview of the status of the PFL program at the state level. This summary report contains monthly information on claims activities, average weekly benefit amounts, average duration of claims, and benefits paid. This data is used in budgetary and administrative planning, program evaluation, and reports to the Legislature and the public.* [Local Area Unemployment Statistics - Alameda County](https://data.edd.ca.gov/d/btnk-tup7) - The Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program is a Federal-State cooperative effort in which monthly estimates of total employment and unemployment are prepared for approximately 7,300 areas, including counties, cities and metropolitan statistical areas. These estimates are key indicators of local economic conditions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S. Department of Labor is responsible for the concepts, definitions, technical procedures, validation, and publication of the estimates that State employment security agencies prepare under agreement with BLS. Estimates for the remainder of the substate labor market areas are produced through a building-block approach known as the "Handbook method." This procedure also uses data from several sources, including the CPS, the CES program, State UI systems, and the decennial census, to create estimates that are adjusted to the statewide measures of employment and unemployment. Below the labor market area level, estimates are prepared using disaggregation techniques based on inputs from the decennial census, annual population estimates, and current UI data
